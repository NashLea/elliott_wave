People of high net worth in fact have all their new income as being on the margin as they can readily convert net worth to consumption, unlike most of us.<br/><br/>If we had a net worth tax, most of us would check off one of the boxes showing our net worth in a range from negative to some threshold number to exclude basic saving needs), and we'd pay income taxes like we do now.  Others who check off one of the high net worth boxes would pull up income tax rates on almost all income, with rates progressing downward to the basic threshold, because they have net worth conversion capacity making all new income on the margin, so to speak.  Change to this view of consumption and perhaps you don't need a net worth tax to lower burdens on most people's consumption in a 12-month period, where most taxes lay.<br/><br/>So ignoring net worth is used to govt finance and economic policies that end up with higher tax burdens on the bulk of us who only have income, most of which needs to be consumed."}]}, "lft": 54, "assetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/the-age-of-frozen-certainties/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 14475437, "rgt": 59, "userDisplayName": "Joseph O'Shaughnessy", "createDate": "1426911905", "userID": 15587466, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1426911966", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Downers Grove, Illinois", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1426908366", "commentSequence": 14475437, "commentBody": "Time to attack the age of frozen certainties.<br/><br/>Start with the theory of consumption. Marginal propensity to consume on income that is realistically expected involves short term income. The idea that a individual's marginal propensity to consume is determined by both current income and windfall income, or on \"income smoothing\" (whatever that is) is wrong. <br/><br/>No decides to buy or not to buy a BMW based on his or her analysis of projected lifetime income. He is making a certain income; he makes the decision. <br/><br/>As an individual becomes more successful, his purchases decline because he has less opportunity. In short, he has acquired much of what he wants and needs. <br/><br/>As for stagflation, oil prices quintupled and did so at a time when the bills for Viet Nam were coming due.  <br/><br/>The rocket was going up. Oil prices increased 100% per year, faster than we could throw water on it, but government from 1973 to 1979, did nothing to try to stop it. <br/><br/>That is, there was no economic reaction to the supply shock. Consequently, there was no normal Phillips curve response. <br/><br/>In reality, no one was fighting inflation at all. Merely buttons that said \"WIN\" (Whip Inflation Now.) Please.  <br/><br/>The economists who held those positions on both consumption and inflation were wrong then and they are wrong now. <br/><br/>There will be no inflation in the near term because there is no aggregate demand. <br/><br/>There is no aggregate demand because consumers are broke.   <br/><br/>Like Elvis, the money has left the building.

We need to get the federal government out of much of the interference in our daily lives , so that it can concentrate on the few very important jobs for which the U.S. government was originally designed.  The government is far too large, too intrusive, and too diluted to do its proper jobs when they arise.<br /><br />Teddy Roosevelt wouldn't call for bigger government.

The first few efforts to plug the gap were lame, to be forthcoming about it. Obama should ensure that the lax policies and response from BP are also taken note of and punished accordingly. BP has also been too late in accepting responsibility for the spill, which should have come a long time ago. They have also been trying to distort facts with reduced oil flow estimates.

I admit that this does not always pay off, but it's usually the smart bet.  And we're all familiar with his predecessor's strategy, which was to play high-stakes liar's poker with the country's money while holding a pair of deuces.  That didn't work out too well.<br /><br />Mr. Obama does not appear to be going for BP\u2019s jugular, but I can\u2019t help feeling that it would be pointless and counterproductive for him to waste energy with public recriminations at this stage of the game.  There will be time for that later, and I hope it comes.  But the spewing oil needs to be stopped, and like it or not BP is pretty much the only game in town.<br /><br />Yes, Mr. Obama seems to be too reserved at times, and he may be missing opportunities to engender some real emotions.  Yet when he emerged bloodied, but not beaten, from the health care reform gauntlet, he engendered some very real emotions.  I watched John Boehner almost swallow his tongue with anger, enraged that the Republicans, who had pulled out every stop, and countered him at every turn, were unable to keep Mr. Obama from getting what he wanted.<br /><br />It would be too easy to think that Mr. Obama is missing opportunities, or losing sight of the big picture, or letting CEOs and oil companies get away with murder.  I still trust that he knows what is important, and is doing what needs to be done.  If he makes an error, I think he learns from it and adjusts his strategy accordingly.  This is what smart people do.  In the end, I think Mr. Obama is going to get what he wants.  And if in the process he can make John Boehner cry, then he\u2019s A-OK in my book.<br />", "recommendationCount": 952}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

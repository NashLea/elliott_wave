Maybe using ooma or some of the newer tech's make it worthwhile, but basically a a cable based phone line is just barely competitive.  As for cool location based services, I'll stick with asking the internet at home what's available first so I don't waste my time wandering around to questionable destinations.<br />Maybe someday the interconnected world will work outside the city center, but right now it leaves a lot to be desired.

Apple has had a great run w/iPod and iPhone but their proprietary focus will ultimately marginalize the iPhone platform relative to Android in a manner similar to what happened w/PCs.  Verizon is on to something w/their iDon't campaign.  Many people may not care that they can't have a spare battery for their iPhone, but some component will.  Likewise with many other features.  The iPhone will likely fare better in phones and tablets- Google circa 2010 is no IBM circa 2004 and neither is MS when it comes to ultraportable devices- but ultimately, all the other phone and computer mfrs (not to mention the carriers) are going to start to coalesce around something and Android looks like the most likely  beneficiary.

I\u2019ve come to this conclusion; it\u2019s all coming down to the customers\u2019 preference. Apple has more applications than Nexus One. The iPhone connects easily to iTunes, pictures and music.  The search engine for Apple store is more efficient then Android. But, enhancement like QSB makes it a little bit easier. Apple has always controlled the application development on the iPhone; which is not the case for Google Nexus One. Web surfing is obviously much easier on Nexus, it sounds like the person digitally lives in the Internet. What about implementing the use of WIFI to get a cell phone reception? This will come handy if you are in a \u201cdead zone\u201d; which seems the case for AT&amp;T most of the time.<br />Despite these differences, the factor that matters the most in my opinion; and helps left up the confusion fog is the network coverage. AT&amp;T customers suffer on a daily basis from weak coverage. When I will decide to buy a Smartphone I think I am going to go with Nexus One.  I\u2019ve read an article in the Washington Post that Nexus One is coming to Verizon, which is better coverage than AT&amp;T.  If they equipped the Nexus One with the cloud computing concept, then problem solved. I will be able to have access to all of the applications, data, and communications on remote servers.  I just hope that Verizon network infrastructure will be able to handle such evolution .After all cloud computing makes computing person-centric, rather than device-centric.<br />"

However, I have discovered some interesting features about the Nexus One Cellular phone that I would like to investigate further:<br /><br />3.7 inch high Amoled display micro SD card slot with 16.7 million colors and 800x480 pixel resolution<br />Linux 2.1 operating system with a wider variety of applications programming capabilities in JAVA<br />Very fast with 1 GHZ mobile processor with 600 MHZ CPU and DROID clocks in at 530 MHZ<br />512 MB of RAM<br />512 MB of ROM<br />Good voice input<br />Battery shelf life of 7.8 hour battery life<br />With the exception of AT&amp;T, Nexus One supports 3G globally<br />Supports HSDA for high speed performance on both uploading and downloading<br />Sim card capability to use on most GSM mobile devices.<br />Chrome web browser capabilities for rendering HTML-pages and JavaScript<br />Faster and Flexible web browsing capabilities wider range of searching<br /><br />The phone features seem to be impressive, however, there are problems for Google with public security. This is largely due to the iPhone Safari\u2019s internet browser feature, which has a dial phone number that is easily accessible by hackers. Hackers have the capability of taking over all calls incoming in and going out. They can obtain the phone numbers and use the numbers in dangerous ways. Google also has a problem with its wide range web browsing service. This service requires monitoring security levels and auditability to meet compliance requirements.<br /><br />To suggest a strategy for Google I would recommend referencing the server side of applications. For example, Cloud computing uses the Android operating system, with a high-speed network connection to communicate with a clone of itself and resides in the cloud-computing environment. Android is used to maximize what the server architect and programmers can do on a small client machine. It preserves battery power because in the server environment, Android is hooked into a power grid, which allows for a lot of software access from the grid.<br /><br />"

But the main deterrent to me bringing a dedicated camera along at all is that it's to much of a hassle keeping all the stuff pertaining to the camera organized.<br /><br />I use my iPhone for most photographs that actually get taken, rather than my expensive Nikon SLR or my rather nice Sony compact camera.<br /><br />Would I have the pocket space for a dedicated higher quality camera? Sure.<br /><br />So why don't I - ever - bring my nice cameras along? They rest permanently in my equipment closet, together with a couple of RC helicopters, a handfull of RC cars, my high-quality flatbed scanner, my stationary computer, my various GPS-equipment, and my collection of high-powered flashlights.<br /><br />Quality is secondary when it comes to consumer level electronics. Ease of use is really the only thing that matters.<br /><br />I don't mind having single-purpose gear, as long as it is immediately useful out of the box. For example, I use my high precision laser distance measuring device plenty - even though all it does is measure distances. If I would have to upgrade the firmware of the distance measuring device - even just the once - or ever bring it out of its dedicated space without being able to use it immediately, it would go straight to the \"unusable technology closet\".<br /><br />A piece of gear needs to do it's job with a great degree of predictability and a reasonable degree of elegance in order for it to defend it's space in the consciousness of the user.<br /><br />So:<br />Separate battery charger - Straight to the \"unusable technology closet\".<br />More than one physical entity to keep track of - Straight to the closet.<br />Even a half-inch larger than anything else that does almost the same thing - Straight to the closet.<br />Not beautiful - Straight to the closet.<br /><br />Now, whilst some of the gear in my \"unusable technology closet\" was really nice to buy, and maybe even defended its space in my consciousness for a while, I stopped using it for the same reason: It takes to much conscious thought to keep working.<br /><br />The best camera is the one that you have on your person when cool stuff happens. The best phone is the one that makes it possible to order pizza to your friends house at 1 am. The best toy is the one that is immediately accessible when you have your unexpected 2-minute break from everyday chores.<br /><br />It goes further than this: The best bullet shooting rifle is the one that is available when you happen upon a bunch of deer outside buckshot distance whilst hunting for geese. The best coffee is the cup that you can get within one minute of thinking of it.<br /><br />Ease of use, small footprint, low degree of direct-access-downtime, and immediate utility are all good things. Removable batteries are a hindrance to all these good things.<br /><br />In my work as a physician, it's practical to have easy access to radiological imaging techniques, blood analyses, and a large staff of highly specialized colleagues. I wouldn't regularly bring any of these resources with me on my vacation though.<br /><br />Similarly, if I were a professional photographer, I'd draw great utility from the ability to shoot several thousand high-quality stills on a work field trip. But I still wouldn't bring the SLR Nikon on my summer vacation, I'd just use my iPhone.<br /><br />Best,<br />Erik Nilsson"

I've spent a significant part of my free time over the last 14 years designing and creating an image-heavy book that you can download and read on-screen or print and read on paper.  It's called \"In the Temples of My Fathers,\" and you can find it at:  <a href=\"http://www.randaldoering.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.randaldoering.com</a>, a crude but functional web site.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Craig has opened some real issues with his smart blog post.  The futurist William Gibson (\"Neuromancer,\" \"Burning Chrome,\" \"Pattern Recognition\") thinks book publishing will become a boutique industry as the online library grows, and many others have argued this point of view as well.  I think the portability and cheap cost of books will keep them around, but new technologies drop fast in price, and ebook readers will become better (lighter weight, longer battery life, higher resolution for easier-to-read, tougher and more durable, color instead of black and white, able to handle a variety of formats) and cheaper pretty quickly.  As powerful, colorful and highly useful devices like the iPad (as its current weaknesses are corrected) are adopted, it will become possible to put some truly spectacular works of both fiction and nonfiction on them.<br /><br />I think that in the end, content really is king, but design is part of the content.  My own background is in programming, writing, anthropology and design.  We all know that most books don't require much in the way of design, as Craig argues:  a column of text with ragged or justified right margins will take care of everything but illustrated works and poetry.  In the case of poetry, add more careful use of line length, but essentially the \"page\" stays the same.  With readers the size of the iPad, and a little bigger, it will be possible to bring to these viewers fully illustrated, illuminated works.<br /><br />See my book, above, if you wonder what I mean.  Are others out there actually engaged in producing works to challenge the current market's thinking?  If so, where are your works, so we can all see what you're up to?  "

Apple does NOT sell gadgets of any sort; apple sells what I call \"lifestyle enablers.\"  That is, Apple's ideas enable a person to live their life in a way that's easier, more efficient and enjoyable.  That fact that people do this using gadgets manufactured by Apple is purely coincidental.  If Apple could accomplish their goals by selling magic elves, they would be selling magic elves.<br /><br />Apple asks a simple question:  What will make a little box useful to a lot of people?  In the case of an iPhone, it's apps for  browsing, music, email, weather, maps, contacts, photos, etc.  Apple moves down the list and builds a device that will do all of that fairly well.  They construct a touch screen equal to the task of making people happy while they use all those useful apps.  They painstakingly construct a simple regimen around that touch screen to make it simple and stress-free to use.  When all of this is assembled, they ask:  Can this box be sold at a price that the public will accept?  If so, it's sold.  If not, the design goes back on the shelf until technology prices drop.<br /><br />What about multitasking, USB ports, printing, etc?  If NONE of those are required to deliver the feature list to the customer, they're not important.  A USB port is essential for syncing, but not for browsing.  What could I possibly use multitasking for anyway, beyond listening to music while browsing, reading email or using the NY Times app?  What good is printing when most of my time is spent in meetings, a car, train or restaurant.  In my office, my PC can print documents.<br /><br />Techies throw these features out, but just what do they mean to most people?  Why should I need 4 USB ports?  I don't even use 4 USB ports on my home computer.  All my peripherals are wireless!  Multitasking?  Great on my office computer, where I can open 6 windows and cycle through everything.  If I tried that while walking down the street, I'd get hit by a bus!<br /><br />The iPad is a reader, pure and simple.  It's a reader that can do a lot of very cool things besides being a reader.  It's a Kindle killer (especially at the price point of the lowest cost iPad).  It's not a laptop or a workstation.  It's made to be a conduit to enjoy life.  With it, I'll be able to conduct most of my personal business - the heavy lifting will always be done by the laptop or workstation.<br /><br />Is the hardware expensive, given its features?  Sure.  But it's the software that makes it worthwhile.  The software does not waste my time.  Every minute saved is an additional minute I can spend AWAY from the computer doing something worthwhile.  Those recovered minutes of my life more than make up for the price.  When I get the iPad, it will Just Work.   And that's all I want.<br /><br />"

Thus, all the innovation you heap upon the Apple, came from engineers and applied software scientists that migrated, naturally, from the likes of Palo Alto, to the likes of Cupertino.<br /><br />For all those who would like to speak of the great innovation of the iPhone, take a moment, to pause and revisit history. As the first company to combine, a color touch-screen, WiFi antenna, Bluetooth antenna, GSM antenna, a true web browser, MP3 player, ability to install third party apps, replaceable battery, memory expansion via SD cards, and more packaging innovations, that do not quickly come to mind, into the PDA platform, it was HP, in its HP6315, in 2004.<br /><br />So for all you Apple deity followers, know that the great one, as you would have it, was in fact itself, a johnny-come-lately, adapter of an already did-that done-that innovation and technology set.<br /><br />Beyond what the HP6315 had accomplished, some packaging which is the benefit of time to do so, and software adaptations, that its engineers most surely did not invent, what has the iPhone, and thus Apple bought us. Nada; oops my bad, thats right, Apple gave us very good, hyped marketing.<br /><br />As one, who while working at a small mom and pop computer store, saw the first of the Lisa's come through the door, unpacked it on the spot, set it up, attached a third party printer, intuitively, not ever having seen it before, caused its word processor app, that sat on the desktop, to be invoked, then create a simple document, and print it out, I'd say, it was new.<br /><br />But just new to me, a then tech-savvy salesperson and computer geek. How innovative would it have been to the engineers in XEROX's PARC research labs? I'd contend, probably not at all; more like an unscrupulous adaptation.<br /><br />And as one who owns a working MessagePad 110, I would contend, that it was Apple's greatest true innovative moment; one that they dropped, and allowed Palm and thus Compaq to run with.<br /><br />And only after those two entities created the PDA market, and HP embodied the PDA and cellular telephone with the HP6315, did Apple then have the basis for the iPhone.<br /><br />I will at some point, probably with the incorporation of 4G, and some of the obvious left out features, obtain an iPhone. And for what, as many of the Apple worshipers, who would have me as an Apple-hater, would ask? As an end test platform for app development. Yes I am cognizant of the following, and thus need to develop across the platforms, of which the iPhone is one.<br /><br />And oh yeah, please one of the truly knowledgeable ones, please tell me, what truly important app, can I not get for an Android, that is exclusive to just the iPhone. Oh I can answer that, for you, and again it is nada.<br /><br />Oh yeah, here's the question...sorry about the diversions of remembrance...but what in the end, besides a cult like following, will have been the iPads innovation, beyond what has already been available. Again, I will contend, it is nada.<br /><br />So, if I did need a watered down tablet computer, I personally would skip the iPad, with all of its shortcomings, and would wait for the likes of the HP Slate.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the Slate is an HP wanna-be...right!?!<br /><br />He-He-He"

Consumers purchased homes that they couldn't afford, but were able to obtain loans because credit standards were lax.  Mortgage brokers sold mortgages that consumers couldn't afford or didn't understand.  Those mortgages were packaged into debt securities to be sold to investors and given AAA ratings by ratings agencies that either didn't understand what they were reviewing or gave the securities high ratings because they were being pressured by the banks who were packaging the loans who could make the ratings agencies compete for business.  Congress was encouraging homeownership by asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to issue riskier loans from consumers who probably had no business being homeowners.  Banks took on too much debt, and didn't have enough margin for error when things went bad.  They also risked the survival of their firms to generate high short term profits and pay large bonuses.  The regulators chose to loosely regulate.  AIG insured debt using credit default swaps, but didn't hold enough reserves in case they actually needed to pay claims.  And everyone assumed that housing prices would never go down, and that fact would solve all of the potential problems listed above."

The specs on the Evo 4G, the Droid Incredible, the Nexus One ALL blew the socks off the 3GS.  With the exception of screen revolution, the specs on the iPhone4 are only just catching up to these Android competitors.   New phones in the pipeline like the Galaxy S line from Samsung and the Droid X/Droid 2 are already going to leave the iPhone in the dust.  The final area where Android software lacked was on UI, and that is going to be soon addressed with the release of Android 3.0 this winter (not that 2.2 is all that bad).  I predict Verizon is still holding onto its game changer, though.  With Verizon launching its 4G LTE network this winter, I predict the mother of all smartphones being launched along with it.  Apple has fantastic marketing people (In my opinion, their biggest strength), but Verizon is learning quickly how to combat that.  Apple's had their day in the sun.  They innovated the smartphone market, and I thank them for that.  Unfortunately for them, Google has taken the game to a whole other level."

The U.S. needs to be the innovator, and the American People need to demand that companies like Apple, Dell (and many mant others) build there devices here in the United States. Companies that are \"American\" or have substantial operations here should be required to hire Americans to build there products. Will the products the then cost more?

If I could network them and operate them from a central core computer I'd do it that way, but restrictive EULAs (End User Licensing Agreements) interfere with an otherwise sensible arrangement.<br /><br />Like all things, Tablet PCs have shortcomings. My main gripe doesn't involve the hardware so much as how Microsoft's Windows Vista Business OS runs on it.  Vista turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. Supposedly, intramural corporate politics at Microsoft created Win-Vista's shortcomings. One department wouldn't cooperate with another so the OS that Microsoft finally released isn't versatile enough. The teams that developed Vista didn't go far enough in integrating the stylus handwriting functions with various applications; why Tablet PCs haven't caught on with the general market.  Leo Laporte (<a href=\"http://techguylabs.com/)  can\" target=\"_blank\">http://techguylabs.com/)  can</a> probably shed some light on the ins-&amp;-outs of how this came about.<br /><br />Supposedly, Nuance Software's Dragon Naturally speaking (speech-to-text) application  (<a href=\"http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm)  surmounts\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm)  surmounts</a> this bottleneck, although I haven't tested it myself.

All they have to do is create a viable land-based counterforce to our sitting duck fleet, a fleet designed in the 1940s.  With their GDP, they can do this easily without breaking into a sweat.<br /><br />That said, I've been warning about this for years to anyone willing to listen - because I've watched this unfold with my own eyes. I do business in China and Japan.<br /><br />After Nixon opened up China, the first trade was in clothing. Cheap simple clothes, like socks and underwear. Then came the knockoffs - mostly bad quality.  BUT, their knockoffs got better and better - to the point that no one could tell the difference.  The quality garment makers took notice and started using the Chinese to make the good stuff.  Japan and Germany leased them the sophisticated sewing equipment.  Then they started making quality fabric.  Today, they have the worldwide garment industry tied up.  No one could make a big line anywhere else even if they wanted to.  All the technology, skill and materials are over there.  Same with the toy industry.  Garments and toys were not considered a national security issue, so no one cared.  Same with skis, surfboards, tires, appliances, car windshields, on and on.  You name it.<br /><br />The second wave was electronics.  Same story.  At first the cheap stuff.  Now everything is made there - including my iPhone and major electronic parts used by our military.  Along with electronic manufacturing came programming and Internet spying and massive ripoffs of technology. Have you forgotten DVD copies?  The country is one giant theft ring full of economic gangsters.<br /><br />The stupidest thing was that Iridium project in the 90s when Motorola and McDonnell Douglas \"licensed\" their satellite technology to China and taught them how to build rockets to fire the Iridium telecom satellites into orbit.  That gave the Chinese a huge leap forward -- so far forward that they will likely have a man on the moon in two years. After that stupidity came the Boeing and Airbus decision to build plane parts in the very city where this fighter is being made. And you don't think technology is being transferred?<br /><br />Add to this the fact that every American is habitually shipping jobs and wealth to China every time they make a purchase at Walmart or anywhere else for that matter.  Where Walmart led, the competitors were forced to follow.<br /><br />Today, we make almost nothing here nor are we able to.  The skills and technology are now gone.  Plus, they are the bankers.  This hotel I'm staying at here in Tokyo is more than 80% occupied by Chinese - all coming here to Shibuya to shop.  They are awash in cash.<br /><br />And do you know who we have to thank for this?  Big corporations.  They own the place and their corporate agenda comes first - way ahead of our national economic or military security.  They call it Free Trade, but it's really their money laundering machine."

Even there, it is not a monopoly, which requires controlling entry to a market and subverting competition.  The iPod leads among music players, but the iPod touch is really a part of the general multimedia and communications device market.  Again, Apple does nothing to stifle competition.<br /><br />Second, it is important to understand Google and Apple are selling different things with their subscription markets.  Google's subscriptions are for reading in a browser, while Apple's are for apps.  That makes the former less valuable. Google does not already have an established base of thousands of content using iPad apps to manage and promote.  Apple does.  Google also does not offer the number of affluent potential subscribers Apple does.  Clearly, the additional 20% charged by Apple pays for important attributes.<br /><br />Last, but not least, Google has another way of making money in addition to the 10% fee.    It, unlike Apple, will not allow subscribers to keep their personal details and data private.  Instead our identities and interests  will be mined for Google ads and resold to data merchants.  That may be worth more to Google than 20% more in fees from publishers.<br /><br />These are fundamental differences between the two platforms this article fails to address.

However I am amazed at the rise of love/hate opinions about the iPad, which seem worse than the opinions blasted about the iPhone, which were heated at times. I think both Google and Apple make great products, which is great for consumers. Competition keeps the pressure on them to continue to improve their devices/software.<br /><br />The interesting thing that fascinates me is that Apple entered the virgin tablet market with a great product, but did not overprice the iPad with a 'premium' price but rather a low entry price point that stunned consumers and their competition. I believe that this was the one detail that delayed the competition from going head to head with the iPad. Now Apple has the 2nd gen iPad ready to go, and Honeycomb is still in its arrival and priced way over the iPad. Combining this with the eco-system of the app store, retail stores with helpful and savvy customer service, and it appears to be 'game over' for the competitors. I think that Apple was not content to make a great product and have it separate itself from other tablets just on form and function alone; they have that business model down to a science. No, they upped the ante by making a great product, selling it and entrenching it for over a year before any others arrived, and undercutting the one real advantage its competitors have used against Apple over the years.....the price.<br /><br />I want one, and I'm saving my pennies now!

Their engineers made a miracle and the business types screwed it up. NVIDIA is simply incredible and has some of the best guys around -- especially the guys involved with getting developers to come out with versions of CPU intensive applications to run applications to run on GPU's. They built an entire new market for their products and there's not a slacker in the bunch. If Washington had guys like the guys at Intel, AMD and NVIDIA, we'd all have free health care, not pay any taxes, and be selling energy to the Arabs. Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA are the best of the best. They prove that America can still out engineer and manufacture anybody in the world, and Steve Job's Apple ain't bad either. I'm proud to be a valley boy. God bless Berkeley, Stanford, 3000 Sand Hill Road, and the entire left coast. All it takes is brains, raw ambition, and working 80 hours a week. We make NYC look \"laid back\" by comparison.\r"

What if internet goes down?<br/>\n4. Hackers!<br/><br/>Solution:<br/>\nDon't put all your stuff on the cloud. Keep it on your computer, with a hard drive backup separate from your computer. Old fashioned, I know, but what's the downside? Back up some key stuff to the cloud, since redundancy is Rule 1. <br/><br/>Why put all your photos and videos and music in the cloud, anyway? When I look at my stuff, 90% of it is garbage. Or duplicates. Or things I'll never access again. I should just purge it. Yours too, I'll bet. The cloud is like having an ever-expanding junk room. We just keep more and more useless stuff. We'll end up paying extra to transfer and store it all. <br/><br/>Likewise with synching.

Then the prosecutor- Vance Jr.- went around blathering that it is an open and shut case. American and American sponsored correspondentswrote numerous columns (suddenly, and all these years they kept quiet?) how Kahn used to womanize during IMF meetings everywhere. Now, here is the clincher: Within 48 hours and no more of  Christine Lagarde, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sarkozy, ascended to the post of IMF chief, the case against Kahn began crumbling, and he is a free man today. No Conspiracy? Not against someone who might have issues with American hegemony like Jacques Chirac did? Not against Kahn who is less corporatist than Sarkozy, and  he is tipped to be a heavy favorite to be the next president of an important ally? \r<br/><br/>Sarkozy has been extremely unpopular over the last several months. He might have or might not have lost the election. But all politicians suffer from a bout of paranoid attacks aka the Watergate flu every now and then. Also explains the gamble he took in rushing into Libya. If it did not pay off, French people would have crucified him anyway.

In a well-known graduation speech at Stanford he talked of his days hanging at in Reed College's calligraph\u00ady studio after dropping out. At the time Reed (which I attended) had one of the best calligraph\u00ady programs in the country. One could even major in it. Jobs' love of lettering led him to offer fonts on the early Apple computers. So he combined inspiratio\u00adn from an archaic practice with high technology\u00ad. Most American tech products focus on a raw functional look but Jobs focused on beauty - the iphone - when it came out was an object of desire if nothing else. A magical box in which the icons floated as if on a liquid film.  Unprecedented ergonomics. Years ago I read that Steve took his designers to visit Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water to teach them about design. Most Americans are divided between accepting the modern and a pull towards a nostalgic past. Consider \"tradition\u00adal\" architectu\u00adre versus modern. But Steve's approach is more like the Japanese, marrying a deep sense of craft (like the joinery in a Zen temple) with modern techniques to create the new object. He is a rare great American designer who reshaped the world."

Financial institutions are pumping money out of your pockets to speculate, making money on bets in both directions: up and down, slightly sharing with you on ups, and emptying your pockets on down - at the end you recieve at the most 10-15% in the best years, and losing in crisises. All they leave to you in average is 2-4% a year, making for themselves hundreds,  sometimes thousands percent of interest. They call it financial services. ))))<br/><br/>When the money is pumped out of your pocket, and you cannot consume any more the government intervenes and prints money, because those who robbed you don't want to share, but you have to survive. So, the taxes and new money come to support you. And the cycle begins again. And again corporations and banks are pumping out money accumulating the results of YOUR skills and labour, not their's. <br/><br/>So,  super rich first rob you, saying that the need to grow and only after the robbing they pay taxes, and receive additional tax breaks on this robbery. And they need your support and understanding, and they wash your brains till they are empty and clean, and then you repeat after them, that they pay the major part of taxes, that they are job creators, etc. And you finally forget that the brightest ideas like iPad CANNOT be implemented without you, that without you they are NOTHING. vote for YOURSELF!

But, Steve Jobs was also an UBER businessman.  He chose to concentrate on consumers because a small company (which Apple was in the 1990s) can reap higher margins as a boutique vendor.   The decision was to make the best computers and sell them at a premium price.  However, Jobs' goal expanded around the time 'computer' was dropped from Apple's name.  In the last few years, after working with AT&amp;T to bring out and perfect the iPhone, and, being a major stockholder at Disney, Jobs was certainly interested in the business market.  The article makes it sound like Jobs was hostile to business.  He was not.  <br/><br/>The people calling Macs \"toys,\" and demanding a return to desktop computers/work stations will just have to adjust to change.   The iOS devices, starting with the original iPod, have been signals of where technology is headed.  Miniaturization.  Convergence of different uses in one device.  The app revolution.  The cloud.   Laptops will be the typical computer for business and consumer use in the foreseeable future.   Tablets will be preferred ancillary devices when a smart phone is not sufficient.  <br/><br/>I also gather that some commenters do not realize that Apple isn't failing because of its former lack of presence in enterprise.  It is the most successful technology company in the world.   Interest in enterprise is about expanding and maintaining leadership, not because Apple is desperate.  It isn't.   "

It is easy to show huge percentage sales gains for a new category coming into existence with a zero or small base.<br/><br/>I and one of my computer savvy friends evaluated the ergonomics and functionality of the iPad and other tablets early last year, and I more recently have lived with an iPad2 and have gotten first hand experience with its strengths and limitations, which only reinforced the initial impression.

I thought when a teacher taught a class this was an interactive experience. But now this is something you prepare with an ipad.  It was amazing how teachers were ever able to function without an ipad.  By the way netbooks were out before ipad but no one thought that a netbook could be used for teaching.  Of course there was also A Laptop For Every Child.  I guess it was like Newton and these educators were all under trees when an apple rep climbed the tree and dropped apple ipads on their heads.  This gave them new ideas for using computers in education."

I'm a boomer, but like many younger people, we have mostly given up wearing watches -- as timepieces.  Expensive watches only add \"complications\".  Most watches are devolving -- into vestigial pieces of decorative jewelry.  Perhaps only worn with a business suit, as an traditional accessory or personal statement, like a tie, pocket square, or cufflinks.<br/><br/>Most of the day, my internal sense of time is sufficiently accurate to guess at the time +/- five minutes.  For more precise times (priority alarms, parking meters, billable time, etc.) I just reach for my iPhone.  Or perhaps, dig deeper into your experiment, with that wonderful conversation-opening line: \"Pardon me, do you have the time?\"<br/><br/>Re Casio, Samsung, et al \"smart\" watches: They may be too much smart, and not enough wise.  (IMHO) Apple's management is experienced enough to know when first-to-market innovation is a real competitive advantage (e.g. Macintosh, iPhone, iPad), and when to hold back a bit and avoid the first innovator's risks (e.g. Newton).<br/><br/>In addition, Apple is genetically encoded to \"Simplify!\".  Apple's most astute designers have already discovered that any wrist-worn object-of-desire is best conceived as a not-too-big not-too-smart minimalist device.  A nimble satellite -- in digital thrall to the global power of the iPhone (in my pocket, still evolving)."

No amount on money in the hands of consumers can ever generate full employment again, because the things people spend money on simply don't take as much labor as they once did.  The only way to put everybody to work is to permanently expand government jobs and private sector jobs that are financed by the government.  <br/><br/> The consumer market simply won't buy many of the things we need for the 21st Century transition to a sustainable, steady-state economy that pays its own way, not by balancing the government budget but by balancing the environmental budget.     <br/><br/>How do we pay for all this public work?  Print money.  Well, actually, the Fed, which creates all of our money out of thin air, simply buys government bonds. The important thing is for the money supply to be appropriate to the level of economic activity.  The measure of that balance is inflation.  If there is no inflation, then the Fed is not pumping too much money into the system.   <br/><br/>I think John Maynard Keynes figured this out back during the last Depression, and he was proved right by the build-up to World War II.  But the forces of darkness reject that lesson for two reasons.  The \"job creators\" want to be the only game in town, and, in this country, racism.

Manufacturing production in the US is the highest it's ever been--this data is very easy to pull:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=Iiv\" title=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=Iiv\" target=\"_blank\">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=Iiv</a><br/><br/>The issue is that manufacturing the US has become extremely high-skilled and capital intensive (especially robotics). This implies many fewer, although better paying, manufacturing jobs in the US. Further, you will not see US manufactured goods at WMT, nor should you expect to. The US manufactures high value added goods-- e.g. aerospace, cars, semiconductors, and large machinery. It does not manufacture cheap plastic / steel crap-- e.g. iPhone assembly. Those are the highly labor intensive (and low value added) manufactures that have been moved offshore. This is what should be expected from even the most basic understanding of Ricardian economics of international trade."

She has that voice that they remember, that personality that everyone adores, and those looks that draws everyone in. She signed with the music industry at the age of 14 and ever since then she\u2019s grown into one of the world\u2019s most popular singers. With the launch of the new apple music, Taylor Swift publicly announced her thoughts on this new software. She believes that this update is not helpful to artists themselves and that it is only hurting the company. Like her, I believe that it will result in a major decrease in revenue from Apple. It offers no benefits to the artists themselves which ultimately is who the music industry is trying to please. Apple has retreated and has fit her commands about the royalties but they are still launching their streaming service. Over the years, I have watched Taylor Swift grow as an artist. I have seen her music style change from country to pop. I have seen her personality undergo an enormous transformation. During her early days as a singer, I do not think she would have ever opened her mouth in order to complain about the acts of a major worldwide company. Seeing one young girl stand up to an entire company over the course of a few days, to me, is truly incredible. It demonstrates the power that Taylor Swift has acquired over the course of her career and the love that she shares for her own music. "

Music isn't the only thing that can be found online for free. Apparently, Taylor is \"...granted free and unlimited use of [photographer's] work\", meaning she pays her photographers once, and benefits off their work for a long time. That sounds strangely hypocritical does't it? Sure, Taylor can get away with challenging a big company like Apple, but what about a nameless photographer who wants the same rights? He/She may be blacklisted in their profession, just for speaking out. Also, if photographers don't follow Taylor's rules on the unlimited use of their photos, Taylor has the right to smash said photographers camera and equipment. How is this considered fair? Surely Taylor can afford to pay photographers for continued use of their photos, just like she says Apple can afford to pay artists for continued use of music. \"Ms. Swift said she was withholding her latest album...from Apple\u2019s streaming service\", as she should have. However, photographers don't have this privilege, because it is considered career ending. If Taylor really wants to make a statement, then she should show the world how she isn't afraid to treat others the way she demands to be treated.<br/>source:<a href=\"https://junction10.wordpress.com/2015/06/21/those-in-glass-houses-shouldnt-throw-stones/\" title=\"https://junction10.wordpress.com/2015/06/21/those-in-glass-houses-shouldnt-throw-stones/\" target=\"_blank\">https://junction10.wordpress.com/2015/06/21/those-in-glass-houses-should...</a>"

On a technical level, Apple could carry out the order by creating a RAM disk signed by the company\u2019s production certificate for the specific ECID of the suspect\u2019s iPhone. This solution would allow Apple to use existing technologies in the firmware file format to grant access to the phone ensuring that there is no possible way the same solution would work on another device.\"<br/> I don't know enough to say whether this is correct but at least one hacker thinks it a possible way for Apple to assist."

Apple has had a great run w/iPod and iPhone but their proprietary focus will ultimately marginalize the iPhone platform relative to Android in a manner similar to what happened w/PCs.  Verizon is on to something w/their iDon't campaign.  Many people may not care that they can't have a spare battery for their iPhone, but some component will.  Likewise with many other features.  The iPhone will likely fare better in phones and tablets- Google circa 2010 is no IBM circa 2004 and neither is MS when it comes to ultraportable devices- but ultimately, all the other phone and computer mfrs (not to mention the carriers) are going to start to coalesce around something and Android looks like the most likely  beneficiary.  Too bad for Palm.  Their platform is the best, but best tech doesn't mean much."

SUNY is made up of several distinctly different university centers and a large number of four year and other colleges located in every corner and area of the state.   Each of these universities, such as Binghamton, Albany, Buffalo, and Stony Brook have different cultures, different sets of courses and professors, and different foci in terms of areas of special interest.  Each of the colleges and universities have their programs and institutions influenced by the interests of the local communities, the local or regional geography,  as well as corporations that are located in their areas or regions.  The makeup of the student bodies also differs considerably across the SUNY spectrum.  For example, Binghamton attracts many foreign students from around the world because of its very major and well developed computer sciences infrastructure that was developed with substantial support, encouragement and input from IBM many decades ago.  Being a magnet for so many foreign students, the university also offers many programs and degrees related to international studies involving sociology, history and anthropology."

Although Ginni's early morning call sounded accusatory and slightly inebriated, it was also like she said, \"reaching out.\" My take is that Ginni believes, like McEwen and several others, that her husband had a relationship with Anita Hill and that Hill turned against him because of bitterness over that relationship. I do not believe Anita Hill told the whole truth in her testimony (her lie detector test seemed like a stunt), but the blame lies more with Biden, and most of all with Presidents Reagan (who appointed Thomas to EEOC) and George H.W. Bush (who appointed him to the bench despite the cloud over his character.)"

When in fact the SAME experiences were happening simultaneously all over the world, and far from saying, at Roosevelt University's computer center in 1970 (with its 8K IBM 1401), \"hey they have email on multics, we should install CTSS to get it\", we created readme files: punched card decks labeled \"run this\" which would print instructions to the operator.<br/><br/>And world wide, Russian programmers were reinventing the wheel, Chinese programmers were printing big characters synthesized out of the fixed western characters on what printers they could find, UK programmers were demonstrating that Manchester was better than Oxbridge at computation.<br/><br/>Our managers exhorted us not to reinvent the wheel and paid for us to go to conferences at prestige venues, and bring back magnetic tapes loaded with software. WE IGNORED THEM in many cases because at that time, it was usually harder to install software written in a different environment than it was to write it from scratch IF you were any good, and we were...you had to be to survive early computer science classes, which were utter chaos.<br/><br/>If the University of Chicago had email, we would say, cool, I can program that. And then to the dismay of girlfriends we would spend hours doing precisely that: reinventing the wheel.<br/><br/>It appears from the record that in the Soviet Union, computer managers forbid such frolics because it was the official policy of the Soviet Union not to do theoretical computer science and to follow (or steal) US practice, and this created dissidence and discontent.<br/><br/>But: the active element wasn't the human element. Technology had taken on a life of its own. One innovation would support another so we as early hackers lost our autonomy. As early as 1976, in his book Computer Power and Human Reason, MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum called us addicts who were being enslaved to the machine. Two years later, SUNY sociologist Phillip Kraft, in Programmers and Managers, showed the most thoughtful of us the writing on the wall: for the mastery we had over working conditions and even salary was something capitalism would eliminate.<br/><br/>It's an its-story in which the machine had the last laugh.

The next day (Thursday) I took a bus into the city and walked into the regional IBM sales office. I told the receptionist I was looking for a job. She called her boss who, after a few minutes of sizing me up, gave me a 30-minute test; three parts, 10 minutes to do each part. The test was scored and I was invited to meet the regional vice president of sales for a personal interview the very next day (Friday). I shared about an hour with this man discussing my academic experience, my naval assignments, and my life goals. At the end of the interview I was offered a sales trainee job starting on the following Monday.

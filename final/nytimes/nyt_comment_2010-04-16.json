This time the following was a clue and something not quite neatly packed in that suitcase of a column:<br /><br />\"Prizing the future over the past was never an issue in America.\"<br /><br />As usual, what exactly are you saying in this terse but huge thought? If you indeed meant to say America looks forward rather than dwelling on the past and if this is supposed to be healthy I take issue. The old saying about being forced to repeat history comes to mind. It also is a focal point that speaks for something that was nagging me and now my brain has cleared and it relates to the fact that nowhere in your column about the complicated relations between Israel and Palestine did you mention the role of the United States in all of their futures.<br /><br />A recent comment was made by President Obama that he cannot resolve any Middle East issues until the two combatants come to some agreements. I think that a President and a Congress in this case has HUGE leverage regarding the money strings reaching across the globe but because of the star war military plans for the future of our country, Obama cannot involve himself in peace negotiations which would involve having to reign in Israel's nuclear warheads among other things. This was a jarring note at the recent Nuclear non-proliferation summit.<br /><br />I think your column is the spin, and not my thinking.

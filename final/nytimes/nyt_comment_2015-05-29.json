Probably, they want to do away with the image of ruthlessness with civilians. (It is another matter that they have mercilessly killed soldiers and some government officials at Palmyra). Worldwide, they are seen as blood thirsty savages even by Sunni Muslims. Probably, they have understood that unless they gain popularity and support from the locals, they cannot sustain their rule in the long run.<br/><br/>Just because ISIS appears to have softened in their approach in Palmyra, that would not make them angels.

As to Poohbear's assertion that lying to the FBI is not criminally actionable because the respondent was not under oath, Poohbear is not close and doesn't receive a cigar.  Title 18, United States Code, section 1001 makes it a Federal crime to 1) knowingly and willfully; 2) make any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation; 3) in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative or judicial branch of the United States.  Poohbear, please note that section 1001 does NOT require the respondent be under oath at the time that he/she makes  the materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation.  Poohbear's personal opinion of the efficacy of a Federal statute is immaterial to one's liability for violating that statute.  What is truly reprehensible is Poohbear's rather liberal misinterpretation of Federal statute which may put in peril others who read and heed his  misrepresentations.

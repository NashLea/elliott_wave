He was a man of extreme modesty -- and a towering intellect in the academic field of political geography.  His essay, \"The Nature of Frontiers and Boundaries,\" for instance, is rightly considered a classic.  That study, like his other writing, is an exposition of such lucidity and depth that it will always merit careful reading.  I regularly have assigned it in my graduate seminar on Geography, Foreign Policy, and World Order, and, just recently, also to a special group of students -- fifteen young scholars, NGO staff members, and junior government officials from the Republic of Armenia!  I am sure these young Armenians felt very proud when I told them that the essay's author was himself Armenian.  (I had thought, years ago, that your father was initially Romanian -- until, as we were then driving through Watertown Square, he suddenly perked up.  He was looking all around as we drove through the town, and then he told me a bit about his background -- and mentioned an Armenian-American newspaper published in Watertown that he regularly read.)<br /><br />It was in the context of the Research Committee on Political and Cultural Geography (RC15) of the International Political Science Association (IPSA) that I, as well as many others, knew your father.  My wife and I saw him last during the IPSA World Congress in Fukuoka, Japan.  In his RC15 panel presentation in Fukuoka -- remarks whose effect I shall never forget -- he spoke movingly, earnestly, in a very personal way, inwardly almost, about his love of the forest, and a particular forested place.  His political-geographic topic was the very specific region where he was born, and how, historically, it had changed hands.  But I am sure he was thinking, too, of his new home in America -- in Oregon.  A place that he helped to make with his own hands.  With the help of yours, too.<br /><br />It is an honor to have known your father.

Thank you for writing that and reminding us all that our fathers, regardless of their respective quirks, are one of the greatest treasures a man or woman can have.  I myself am an immigrant.  Although my father didn't escape the horrors that yours experienced, he clearly made a choice to leave a successful life for the future of his children.  I am every obliged to him and I don't think I can ever find the words to thank him for what he has done.  I come from a family where we are not necessarily open about our feelings.

Ultimately, it is the competitive nature of the players who feel winning at all costs, realizing the refs cannot see everything at all times, means exaggerating conduct.<br /><br />This happens in every single sport: EVERY ONE! (Hockey: dives; Basketball: players hitting the deck to draw a charge; baseball: sweeping your mitt on the throw to 2nd base on a steal whether you tagged the guy or not/ catchers pulling the ball into the strike zone; Football: receivers holding the ball up on passes that obviously skip or hit the ground).  It is an issue in all sports.  So it has nothing to do with soccer or hating it, or this idea America sports are fair/untainted and better.<br /><br />The problem with Soccer is that FIFA refuses to acknowledge and address the problem and so like petulant children the players push it and push it to new extremes.  And now in a broadcast world of 30-40 cameras covering a match their bad behavior like a \"bad\" Nanny 911 episode(fostered by years of neglect) has become appalling.<br /><br />Every major sport has found ways to combat their own unique \"dives\".  Hockey, basketball: extra refs, video review for goals/end of period stuff; Baseball: more umps, clearly defined rolls for the umps (limited video review), Football: a brigade of refs/sideline officials, controlled video review, challenges, etc.<br /><br />I think FIFA needs to emerge from 1962 and recognize what every other sport has:  players today, and the game move much faster and with a greater alacrity than ever before.  And the field is just as big.  How is it that Hockey and Basketball on much smaller surfaces with half as many players to watch moving at  higher speeds have twice as many officials?!<br /><br />My suggestion would be to have it be similar to these sports:  Add at least 1 or 2 full field refs.  Return the side judges to only offsides (my observation is that these guys are hesitant to call anything major, and never go against the head ref and never call fouls more than 10 feet from the lines).  have 3 officials on the sidelines to manage subs, the clock and the team coaching staff and benches and so forth.  Finally, allow like in basketball for the officials to confer with each other over difficult calls.<br /><br />Finally, as someone pointed out, allow for post-game video review to issue yellow cards for flagrant \"dives\".  This will at least affect players status for future games and maybe put some \"fear\" in them.<br /><br />All of these will not disrupt the continuity of the game, which is crucial, and a big part of hockey and basketball.  (Hockey I think is very similar:  the rules in hockey have basically 2 purposes: prevent injury and keep play moving fluidly (see: icing, delay of game, \"clutching and grabbing\" crackdown, diving))<br /><br />No one expects perfect, but you we all can demand FIFA at least show up prepared.  This World Cup has demonstrated they are not.", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

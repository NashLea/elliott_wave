While the Japanese have suffered two enormous natural disasters with more grace and diligence than the world has witnessed in a very long time -- they clearly need active support from the international community.  If an environmental disaster is unfolding which will affect the entire planet, and this one will, then all of the major nations need to bring their experts to the table to solve the problem.

I believe that we do not know the consequences of a reactor accident. The Sovietunion hid the news for the people. High radioactivity was first discovered 2 days after the accident at the Swedish nuclear plant Forsmark 1,100 km away. People are still forbidden to live in a vast area around Chernobyl, although some people returned. In 2003 a physician in Kiev, Ucraine, told me that the cancer data were still not known. The radioactivity in the Kiev river, where the children were swimming, was still high but unknown to the population. I am a physician and I have never seen so many emaciated peopleon the streets, who looked seriously ill and had wide spread strange skin disorders and scars, which I believe were caused by the radioactivity.<br />Lisbeth Nordstrom-Lerner, M.D.", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 2522492, "replies": [], "lft": 326, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/asia/16workers.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3536961, "rgt": 327, "userDisplayName": "OregonStyleDave", "createDate": "1300244407", "userID": 59917676, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300248361", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Newport OR", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300244761", "commentSequence": 130, "commentBody": "True hero's...Truer Grit", "recommendationCount": 2}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

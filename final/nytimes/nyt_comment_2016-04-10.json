Perhaps one senator from each state needs to be a 'young' senator meaning that when elected they are not aged over 40. The other one can be over any age and we need to change the constitution to allow anyone to be a US Senator above she 18.<br/><br/>The whole issue of superdelegates begs a much larger question. Why should there be a system that so distorts the will of the people by having superdelegates, caucases that make participation very hard for most, and a system where we elect 'delegates'. It's time to modernize an eighteenth century model and have primaries that are directly proportionate to the number of votes cast, albeit at staggered intervals as is currently done. If one person achieves over 50% of the total votes vast they become the nominee. Otherwise we should have a national runoff primary election between all candidates who have obtained above 25% of the vote where the winner subsequently becomes the nominee.

It is unlikely that the government would have been able to recoup anything but a small fraction of these losses without the assistance of the whistleblower.

These cases are going to be much more complicated and the government's resources remain limited.<br/>\n     So I expect that what will happen is that more cases may be initiated by the USAO but much of the leg work will still fall on independent counsel working for the company. Also, it is always going to be easier for the government to proceed civilly, which is why few qui tam complaints have led to criminal prosecutions.

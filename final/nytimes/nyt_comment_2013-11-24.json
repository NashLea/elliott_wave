See, there is always something to learn here at Wordplay.  Something I might want to know, in contrast to what I learned today about MBNYJ.<br/><br/>NW Corner, I don't know if you are tall and dapper, but you may have a future in the XWP-blogging business.<br/><br/>Martin, I very much appreciate your explanation and especially your providing of context.  I tend to think that if arrows were printable in the clues, the S'IL clue would have shown RSVP with an arrow pointing to the S; but since there's no arrow, the clue has to \"point\" us to the second part of Repondez s'il vous plai t by other means.  Using the S in the clue is the chosen means.  It was more the dual C's (which each time \"represent\" \"Commission\" both in actuality and in my brain) that made me raise the question.<br/><br/>Deb, your Reply was very much appreciated and highly readable so I could check off the parts of my long-form stupid question as I went through your explanations.<br/><br/>However, I cannot in any circumstances condone your taking action that makes a grown Timesman* cry!<br/><br/>* -- officially sanctioned word for a male Times employee, see, e.g. perhaps maybe <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/a-50-year-timesman-recalls-the-most-exciting-moment-ive-had\" title=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/a-50-year-timesman-recalls-the-most-exciting-moment-ive-had\" target=\"_blank\">http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/a-50-year-timesman-reca...</a> ? **<br/><br/>** -- I'm no public editor and I'm FAR from being a Robert C.

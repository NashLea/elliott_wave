One of my other doctors has a crummy nurse who has repeatedly not listened to me about my prescription needs, and claimed she knew nothing about the mail order pharmacy I use despite the fact that I have spoken with her previously about it. I realized it flows from the top down and that her boss, my doctor, doesn't listen to me either, and has a phony, condescending consulting room manner with me. I'm done with him and his nurse now. <br/><br/>I think a lot of it is that most doctors are arrogant people who think they know it all when they don't.

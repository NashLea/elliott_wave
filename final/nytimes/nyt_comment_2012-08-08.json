I've made (very small) donations to Obama since 2007, and he still has my support. Voting for Romney is completely out of the question for me, as it is for most people my age or younger (I'm 35). I've never voted for a Republican, and I don't foresee that ever changing. Here's what I don't get about Obama or his re-election campaign/strategy: why is he so unwilling to take traditionally liberal stands on policies? Yes, there is value in taking middle-of-the-road positions to appeal to independent or undecided voters -- but Obama is overcorrecting and moving to the right of center on certain issues, which puzzles me. Why is he so afraid of taking a stand against the NRA and in favor of gun control, for instance? What does he gain by going soft on this? Certainly not the votes of any NRA members, who will no doubt vote for Romney. And what does Obama gain by bashing teachers and unions (via Arne Duncan)? While Republicans might smile upon the Obama Administration's anti-union rhetoric and policies, I can't imagine they'd be sufficiently swayed to vote for Obama merely because of his willingness to take a stand against the AFT and NEA.

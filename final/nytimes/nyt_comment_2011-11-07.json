In reality, I believe decisions pertaining to military expenditures are to a large degree business decisions, and the politicians who support these expenditures do so largely for business reasons, whether for military bases and/or vendors in their districts or perhaps for campaign contributions from the many varied military contractors.  Further, while many politicians might resist any effort to curtail military expenditures, the fact should not be lost that the military, while having a peacekeeping component, is a killing machine.  Why not spend some of the savings from a less boated military on more fruitful endeavors.<br/>\nFinally, we need more independent analyses than what the military  provides as to the required size of our presence abroad, the myriad  weapons systems available now or in the works, and for the sheer number of troops.  It's a clear conflict of interest for the military to be the source of  much of this information.

We could have easily found common cause, since the alliance of Al Qaeda and the Taliban posed problems for the Iranians as well (drug trafficking, discrimination against Afghani Shiites). With other nations to help put pressure on the Taliban leadership, we could have forced them to hand over ben Laden and not wasted 10 years, trillions of dollars, and thousands of lives.<br/><br/>I'm not interested in starting a war with Iran, and especially not over nuclear weapons. While they might be building them, they are rational actors and are using them for deterrence, not seriously planning an attack. And why do they feel a need for deterrence? Who are Iran's enemies: Saudi Arabia and Israel. Both are a threat to Iran in part because of the support they get from us. So, would it be better to start yet another war, with serious spillover consequences, or just to ease up and disengage with both of these false-friend allies?

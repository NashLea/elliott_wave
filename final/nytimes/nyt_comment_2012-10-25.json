Whether or not the mother survives after that doesn't matter as much, from an evolutionary perspective.<br/><br/>As I understand it, childbirth wasn't as difficult or dangerous before humans starting walking upright.  (And as we started developing language and higher brain function, and therefore larger brains and head circumference).   At that point, the shape of our pelvis changed, and childbirth became considerably more difficult.  <br/><br/>Other primates who spend more time on all fours or in trees have a much easier time of it, due to the more accommodating shape of their pelvis and the smaller head size of infants.<br/><br/>I believe the rise in C-sections can be explained by several factors.  For example, mothers are increasingly older (35+), have higher BMIs, and have a higher incidence of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.   Those are all risk factors."}]}, "lft": 122, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/an-unspoken-risk-of-vaginal-birth/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7472106, "rgt": 127, "userDisplayName": "firao", "createDate": "1351137566", "userID": 63432033, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1351137626", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "bronx", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1351134026", "commentSequence": 20, "commentBody": "the adjusted numbers reflect  the reality that used to kill women all over the world, for millenia, and still does anywhere women do not have access to health care.  childbirth is dangerous.  after my child was born i decided Nature had not provided us with a very good design here, regardless of current theories.", "recommendationCount": 31}, {"assetID": 3345170, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7472103, "replies": [], "commentID": 7473346, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "bruce andrew", "createDate": "1351164619", "userID": 63424318, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1351165723", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 10, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Mark Thomason", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Saratoga Springs, NY", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1351162123", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Yes, Mr. Gump there is skimming of wealth going on in this country, but your conclusion that the election doesn't matter I oppose.

The next year I had a \"diagnostic mammogram\"; I honestly don't know how that differed from a regular one.  <br/><br/>Two thoughts: (1) the letter that the hospital sends me after each mammogram says quite starkly, \"We are pleased to inform you that the results of your recent mammogram...did not show any sign of cancer.\"  Although I'm obviously pleased by this, I always felt that perhaps the hospital should use softer language, such as \"no abnormalities were detected\", etc.  (2)  The letter has never said anything about the fact that I have dense tissue. I figured I didn't have dense tissue because my breasts are small and I am petite and relatively thin.  However, this year, I looked at the results posted on my online medical account, and the letter sent to my doctor did contain a disclaimer that the negative results could not be definite because of my dense tissue.  I assume the disclaimer is a standard one.  My doctor never mentioned this at my routine exam last year.<br/><br/>I have just copied this article to bring to my gynecologist next week when I have my annual visit. I think I might go back to mammograms followed by ultrasounds, regardless of whether my insurance pays for it (I think it does).

I played high school hockey at that same school where I reffed female hockey, and the boys were far less likely to carry the puck with their heads down.<br /><br />While you assume that once these players get to the D1 level they don't carry the puck head down, I can assure you that even at the NHL level, you sometimes see the most incredible hits, where the player carrying the puck does not see the hit coming, whether they either have their head down or they are looking the other way. Look at the last Winter Olympics where there were lots of instances where the women were skating with their heads down. Okay, not all of them are D1 caliber, but more women skated with their heads down than in the Men's bracket. The point is that the comparison is relative to the other sex. At each level you look at, I would wager that the women do indeed take more unprepared hits, and more often are skating with their heads down.<br /><br />Sorry for getting sidetracked, but my original point was not just that women were more likely to skate with their heads down, but that they were also far more likely to be unprepared for contact in the corners, while looking down at the puck and digging it out. Men expect to be hit in the corners. I just wonder if the women are not expecting it as much and thus are more susceptible to getting concussed.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1979314, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/rooney-says-his-ambitions-outpace-man-uniteds/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2715310, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Dan", "createDate": "1287632241", "userID": 7611180, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1287634950", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1287631350", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "But Rooney is right... MU has not been keeping pace with the rest of the top tier teams in terms of bringing in and retaining talent.  They let go Tevez who was a fantastic complement to Rooney.  They let Ronaldo go and replaced him with a hodgepodge of decent, but far inferior, talent with the likes of Obertan and Valencia.  And so far this seasons the Red Devils seem hardly the imposing force of 2 seasons ago when they seemed virtually unstoppable.  So Rooney is right to complain.  But he is quite the fool the way he is coming off publicly.  I agree with other posters that this certainly doesn't bode well for him, especially after he had an awful national team campaign and end/start of the EPL season.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure where he can go where he's guaranteed a similar paycheck and ample playing time on the pitch.  Real Madrid don't need him.  Barca isn't a good system for him and they also aren't in dire straits for a striker.  The Milans are both stacked and not in need of another finisher.  Perhaps Man City would like to blow another $100m during the January transfer window??<br /><br />As for MU, my sympathies don't run very deep.  They poached him from Everton in the first place and they've more than gotten their value from him.  In fact, now would be the time to offload him for maximum value.

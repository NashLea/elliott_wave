I was a sap when I began reading this column, anticipating there would be criticism of Obama, as well as his detractors, but that the viewpoints would honestly assess the political landscape facing the President.  I DO find fault with him I many areas, mostly for failing to keep his promise of change.  But for you ignore the rules as defined by the Republicans that Obama has to play by, and not to account for two fruitless years of attempted concilation and compromise, and then to blast him for suddenly playing politics ... What do you think has been going on these last almost-three years?  And this line about how the wealthiest pay the greatest percentage of taxes?  In aggregate, yes.  Individidually, no, a fact you conveniently seem to ignore.  So, I was a sap for David Brooks.

Not only did that not work, he alienated the allies on top of that. Why shouldn't he now go with what the base wants in the first place? At least this can be a starting point for negotiations that would be fairer. <br/><br/>I am also a centrist compromiser but it looks like that would only work with a congress we had 20+ years ago. Which liberal thought we wound be pining for Reagan right now!<br/><br/>I am one of those liberals that is reasonably comfortable right now (by no means rich) and I would even benefit from a republican president. But the hell they would unleash on this country would be unthinkable because of the extremism of the tea party influence. Republicans these days trip over themselves to pander to the fringe whereas the democrats try to attract the centrist independents. So you see, electing a democrat is like electing a reasonable republican of the past.<br/><br/>But if this country ends up electing a republican in 2012, we really would deserve the government we elect and I don't want to hear ONE complaint on these comments from the idiot progressives that stayed home cutting their nose off to spite the country's face.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3250663, "replies": [], "lft": 1784, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/opinion/brooks-obama-rejects-obamaism.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4550809, "rgt": 1785, "userDisplayName": "DoubleC", "createDate": "1316522989", "userID": 32540322, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1316577820", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new york", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1316574220", "commentSequence": 751, "commentBody": "Seriously, David? Obama is now just playing politics? Getting his base riled up? Where were you during the debt ceiling hostage crisis? It's as if you expect the Republican side to behave badly and exhibit no motives other than politics. Yet, when this side pushes back, you decry us for it. Our patience with your side is exhausted. We've endured two years of nothing but the most depraved politics and mischaracterizations by the Republican side. It has not done the country any good.

It seems to me if any .o1 percenters were hanged (not lynched) it would be based on conviction of stealing huge sums of America's wealth. The list of ways many of these wealthiest of the wealthy have abused the laws and encouraged re-writing to benefit themselves is reason enough for conviction. Their failure to use the significant influence they possess and never lift a finger to persuade Congress to care for those struggling (with medical expenses, home mortgage, putting food on the table, etc) while a moral failure and not a legal one amplifies the cry for conviction. The .01 percenters likely have reason to fear, not worry, but fear the eventual consequences of their behavior.

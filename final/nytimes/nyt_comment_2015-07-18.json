Is it written for African-Americans, or is it written for the wider American audience? If the book is launched in an \"African-American space\", isn't it like self-segregating? As someone who is neither white nor black, and who wants to understand and learn and grow, I am not sure what message Coates has for someone like me. On one hand, his purely binary white-black view leaves out a significant portion of the current American population. At the same time, there is a certain accusatory tone, that I find alienating.  Almost like being told, \"if you are not black, at best you don't count; at worst you are part of the white power structure.\"   I submit there is another way - a way that includes all people of good will regardless of their color.

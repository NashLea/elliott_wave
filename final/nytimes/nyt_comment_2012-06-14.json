Are you the photographer whose work I came upon nearly 30 years ago as a picture researcher for The Vietnam Experience, an illustrated book series on the war?  I found your work in Newsweek or Time or one of the other magazines of the time, contacted you, and subsequently published some of your pictures in our books.  I believe we met when you visited our offices at Boston Publishing Company.  I have never lost my appreciation of beautiful, compelling, insightful imagery...  It must be in my DNA.  My 21-year-old daughter is now studying photography in college, planning her senior thesis around a photo project, and soaking up everything she can about its history.<br/><br/>In the small-world department, commenting below, John G. Morris mentions another colleague from my Vietnam Experience days--Kate Lewin--who worked as our Paris-based picture researcher.  A highlight of that job, for me, was visiting the major photo archives such as Magnum, Black Star, Life Picture Service, UPI/Bettmann, etc., to pore over the files of some amazing and iconic images and actually hold them in my hands.  I will never forget the day the great Alfred Eisenstadt  (he, of the Sailor-kissing-the-nurse-in-Times-Square-on-VJ-Day fame) appeared in the offices of LPS as I watched, awestruck.

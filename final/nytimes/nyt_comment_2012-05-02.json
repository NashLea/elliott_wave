When I was in high school the minimum wage was $1.15 and full year tuition at an excellent private university cost $2350 - the ratio was about 2000 times. At today's minimum wage of about $8, that would equate to private college tuition of $16,000. Good luck with finding that. In fact tuition is about 48,000 or 4  times that amount. In contrast a nice Cadillac 4 door sedan in 1965 cost $5666 or 5000 times the minimum wage. At todays minimum wage, a Cadillac sedan should cost $40,000 and in fact costs about $36,000. <br/><br/>The truth is that University tuition is a bubble supported by scholarships and loans. The student loan market has just hit 1 trillion dollars, most of it government (taxpayer) guaranteed. This is similar to the Fannie Mae home loan situation that existed before the crash. The availability of this huge pot of money is what enables colleges to raise their tuition without any market constraint. Whenever they raise tuition, politicians step in to \"help\" students, when in fact it is this interference which enabled the tuition increase in the first place.

These are serious problems that need addressing.<br/><br/>But still, even now, college - despite its enormous (almost crippling) initial cost - still offers significantly more long-term value than the alternative: a high school diploma.

There was certainly a lot more good will towards the American cause before the invasion, and that could have been used to much greater advantage if our leaders had shown less eagerness to use bunker-buster bombs all over Afghanistan.

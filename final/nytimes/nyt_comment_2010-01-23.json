But, I\u2019ve read couple of articles on this ongoing technology war.  I\u2019ve come to this conclusion; it\u2019s all coming down to the customers\u2019 preference. Apple has more applications than Nexus One. The iPhone connects easily to iTunes, pictures and music.  The search engine for Apple store is more efficient then Android. But, enhancement like QSB makes it a little bit easier. Apple has always controlled the application development on the iPhone; which is not the case for Google Nexus One. Web surfing is obviously much easier on Nexus, it sounds like the person digitally lives in the Internet. What about implementing the use of WIFI to get a cell phone reception? This will come handy if you are in a \u201cdead zone\u201d; which seems the case for AT&amp;T most of the time.<br />Despite these differences, the factor that matters the most in my opinion; and helps left up the confusion fog is the network coverage. AT&amp;T customers suffer on a daily basis from weak coverage. When I will decide to buy a Smartphone I think I am going to go with Nexus One.  I\u2019ve read an article in the Washington Post that Nexus One is coming to Verizon, which is better coverage than AT&amp;T.  If they equipped the Nexus One with the cloud computing concept, then problem solved. I will be able to have access to all of the applications, data, and communications on remote servers.  I just hope that Verizon network infrastructure will be able to handle such evolution .After all cloud computing makes computing person-centric, rather than device-centric.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1086536, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/a-big-picture-look-at-google-microsoft-apple-and-yahoo/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1460795, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "myonlinelifenow", "createDate": "1264218846", "userID": 59030159, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264223434", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Toronto", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264223434", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "I think for Apple you can add a light blue dot in the maps section.

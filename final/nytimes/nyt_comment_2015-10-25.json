It has taken large feats of civil engineering, and many dams of concrete and steel in pristine mountain valleys, to make California a pleasant place to live. <br/><br/>Instead of whining about a forest fire spoiling his vacation Mr Duane should appreciate that fire is a part of the landscape and native plants are adapted to it. I recently did the same drive from Mono Lake and Lee Vining over Tioga pass to Yosemite. The day before I arrived the pass had been closed due to an early snow. Climbing up to Tioga pass through mountains dusted with snow and wreathed in cloud, I knew I was looking at one of the most spectacular landscapes in the United States. At a small lake close to the top I parked and got out to look at the view. An icy wind roared through the pass, and I though of what awesome things modern roads and cars and gasoline are. The landscape was beautiful, but also very harsh and unfriendly to man.

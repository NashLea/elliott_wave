In your blog you suggest that Romney is still moving into those head winds, and no doubt that's true. But you give Mr. Obama no credit whatsoever for his competence. The list of his accomplishments are long and impressive: He killed Bin Laden, he bailed out Detroit and saved not just the auto industry but numerous ancillary industries that work with that industry. He pushed through healthcare reform, something that Democratic presidents have failed at for generations. People might not like it now without a lot of information about it, but they will once they can't be tossed off their insurance for pre-existing conditions, for example. Even Mitt Romney likes that part of Obamacare. Obama quietly stopped genocide in Libya, which rebounded to overthrowing Gaddafi. He ended Don't ask don't tell. He signed the Lilly Ledbetter fair pay act as his first piece of legislation. He helped stem our slide into a depression. For crying out loud, what more can a president do in four years? When Republicans say he failed it boggles the mind. Could he have done more with jobs? Yes, but he was thwarted by Republicans on that score. They've watched how effective he's been in so many areas.

What the analysis reveals is that prolonged political and, especially, economic and social estrangement from China would be an unmitigated disaster for the Japanese nation.<br/><br/>The truth is, not only today and tomorrow, but even more so in the years and decades ahead, as Japan\u2019s economy matures and its population shrinks and ages, continued growth and prosperity of Japan\u2019s economy and society will require increasingly deep and broad integration with a more vibrant Asia, and particularly with China.\"<br/><br/>\"In just the economic sphere, it is clear that China is going to retaliate, probably massively, against Japanese business interests.

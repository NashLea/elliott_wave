Don't you think it a bit insulting to claim that people need religion to be civilized?  To believe that caring about others requires a religious framework?  Yes, churches, or organized religions, if you will, facilitate carrying out work that benefits others in several different ways, for example, by teaching about serving others and by providing both a place where people come together to learn about what is needed and then to plan and join together in carrying out helpful actions.  OTOH, various secular organizations have done and are doing the same sorts of things.  And they do it without the intolerance and self-righteousness that all too often are part and parcel of religious organizations.  It would pay to remember that many of the Europeans who first came to the new world did so to escape religious persecution in their home countries--persecution that came not from the non-religious but from others who believed in a different religion.  Of course, once here most of them practiced the same sort of behavior towards those not of their beliefs.

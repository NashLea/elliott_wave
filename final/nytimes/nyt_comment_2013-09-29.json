Meanwhile, hearing of this miraculous cure, other doctors began using hypnosis with victims. Not only did none of the other patients respond, but the treatment also failed with the one patient who had previously responded.

It's usually not used because the technology for it is expensive.

The ones that are genetically okay are used or frozen for future use, and the ones that are not okay are discarded or used for research.<br/><br/>Many religious people oppose IVF because they believe each embryo can become a baby and thus it's wrong not to use all embryos. They're wrong, since most embryos are either not genetically capable of becoming a baby or are not going to implant. Case in point: if you do CCS testing, the most advanced and accurate genetic testing available today, and it tells you that a given embryo is genetically healthy, that embryo still only has a 60% chance of becoming a baby.

Because he is filthy rich.  And what does this prove?  This proves that Capitalism is often a grotesque system because it posits a perfect correlation between monetary wealth and inherent worth, i.e., if you are very rich, you are deemed to be intrinsically morally and intellectually superior.  Actually, Harvard proved the falsity of Capitalism's assumption that great wealth was indicative of inherent superiority.  IN 1968, that school's psychology department found that the variable that correlated most strongly with financial wealth was the ability to look someone in the eye and lie at the same time.

Seven years and no higher minimum wage, no additional spending on infrastructure (jobs, jobs, jobs and much needed improvements-even Donald recognizes our airports need work!), no support for women's health, no tax reduction for the middle class &amp; lower, no help with education expenses, no support for renewable energy,  ...

Obama has diminished their party and hurt our nation. Unfortunately, those supporting the current GOP candidates are still blaming the wrong people.

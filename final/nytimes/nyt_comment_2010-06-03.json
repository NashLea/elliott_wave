The AL commissioner (If I'm correct it was the league commissioner and not Bowie Kuhn), as I recall, ruled that the umpire failed to uphold the \"spirit\" of the rule. Excess pine tar did not help Brett hit the home run, thus there was no valid reason to take it away other than on a technicality, and that was not in the spirit of fair competition.<br /><br />This of course is a safe/out call, just a basic meat and potatoes blown call, for which there is no precedent in baseball history of a reversal.<br /><br />And of course it opens up Pandora's Box.<br /><br />But in the absence of replay to assist that call, and with the ump's full and unambiguous confession that he blew the call, a precedent could be established here.<br /><br />Simply: It would have been the last play of the game, if called correctly. The precedent can simply be this: In the case of irrefutable evidence that the ump got the call wrong on the last play of the game, the league can overturn the call. Now of course you would expect that to be used to change a stolen loss into a deserved win or a fair tie, but in this case it could be used to award an earned honor.<br /><br />All of that is in the best interests of the game and is in the spirit of fair competition.

One point, though. No attempt to convince Iran to give up nuclear arms will be successful--or even morally coherent--unless Israel is also convinced to give up its nuclear forces.

Is it any wonder that Iran sees Western attempts to strong-arm it as hypocritical?

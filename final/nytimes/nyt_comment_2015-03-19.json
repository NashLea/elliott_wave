That's my objection to them.  The problem is not that they \"fuel female insecurity\" but that they sexualize children and children's bodies.  There's a reason why our culture has traditionally frowned on young girls' wearing makeup: it is because the point of makeup is to enhance the wearer's sexual desirability. There is always a tension between adolescents who want to be grown up and their parents who want to protect them. That's usually the context in which a parent says \"you're too young to be dolled up like that.\"  Here we have the exact opposite case: parents deliberately sexualizing their children and, perhaps worse, inculcating in them the deeply perverse belief that physical appearance and conformity to culturally constructed notions of beauty (which are also usually racist) are all that matter in life.  <br/><br/>If all that were not enough, these pageants reinforce the deeply sexist double standard in which, for girls, in contrast to boys, looks are all that matter.  I note, in that regard, that there are never - at least as far as I know - beauty pageants for boys.  Ever wonder why that is?  Could you imagine parents primping, coiffing and dressing up their 4-, 8-, or 12-year-old boys to look like runway models so that they could parade in front of a group of grown men and women and be judged on how beautiful they are?

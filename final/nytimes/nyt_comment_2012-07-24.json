The NCAA sanctions to remove all wins since 1998 is not fair to all the players and coaches who played the game fair and square.  Except for Paterno and the AD, the players or the assistant coaches might not have had anything with the crime.  You can make the University management pay for the oversight by banning future bowl-game appearances and reducing scholarships etc.  Erasing past records is not justifiable.<br/>\nThe PSU president Erickson's said that losing the record was a better choice than taking the alternative of death penalty for several years, hence they did not content the sanctions.  So it again boils down to MONEY!!  So how is the NCAA changing the culture.  The right penalty should have been the death penalty for a few years, so that the MONEY factor takes the biggest hit and the program can start afresh with a new culture keeping in mind that Football is not the only thing on campus.<br/>\nAnother thing that comes to mind is that everyone is piling on a person who cannot defend himself and are demonizing him.  The PSU management and Board are also responsible for this and have made as much money using Paterno's name and fame for decades but are now trying to deflect all of the blame on him.

What with this happening, I don't think that football playing students are going to apply there and the new coach is getting blamed when he might not have even been there. He won't want to coach the team if this kind of thing is taking place. The football playing students will transfer and they will make a point of ignoring the letter of intent if Penn State sends it. If there are other places to apply, they will do it. Penn State will have a turnover in football coaches because they don't want to go 4 years without a bowl game. This school had a very good program and with all of this happening, it is going to be rock bottom. The other students might decide not to go there as well. They too, might transfer along with the kids who play football.

The rise of the middle class through the middle of the 20th century was primarily due to two things - first, the New Deal and creation of social safety nets and government funded higher education, and second, the availability of relatively inexpensive locally produced oil. With US Peak Oil hitting in the early 1970s, there was no way to keep growth going at the same rate. As a result, the Republican party initiated an insidious form of class warfare against the middle class, but using clever advertising to convince much of the middle class that it was doing the opposite (which it was not). It is not necessary here to repeat the obvious, that high marginal tax rates in the 1950s-70s were never a barrier to growth or to overall social welfare. With the end of peak oil, the wealthy saw their future profits failing and acted accordingly. The problem is the failure of the middle class voter to see this obvious trend, so that it repeatedly voted republican leaders into place.

Businesses have increasingly made use of the overseas labor to reduce costs and therefore increase profits.  Some of these lower costs have been passed along to consumers, decreasing the cost of living.<br/><br/>Secondly, it increases the payoff to winning in business. The market for a successful product or service becomes the world instead of a neighborhood, state or country.  Corporations have grown in size, selling products and services worldwide.  The monetary rewards accruing to those providing the goods and services have grown together with their size and global reach.  Entrepreneurs, CEOs, entertainers, star athletes and others at the top have become fabulously wealthy.  Because their supply is relatively limited, the compensation for knowledge workers has also grown faster than GDP.<br/><br/>Some would suggest that globalization should be resisted rather than embraced.  I think such an action would be self-defeating in the long run.  The trend towards global integration is inevitable, and, by fighting it, a country merely guarantees that it will be left behind.<br/><br/>Finally, globalization materially helps developing countries and their most vulnerable citizens, as can be seen from the quickly dropping global poverty rate."}]}, "lft": 1078, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/a-closer-look-at-middle-class-decline/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 6698625, "rgt": 1081, "userDisplayName": "rationalexpectations", "createDate": "1343102889", "userID": 2132796, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1343102958", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Westchester, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1343099358", "commentSequence": 339, "commentBody": "The question is what caused the median income in the U.S. to fall and the income concentration to rise in the near term.  First of all, an objective eye indicates that a slower growth trend in median family income started around 1968, not at the start of Reagan's or Bush II's term.  The peak of median income in 2000 was likely a fluke caused by the tech bubble and not something to make too much of.  The recent decline is due to the worst recession since the Great Depression, and is not so meaningful as an endpoint, either.  So this is more about what happened around 1968.<br/><br/>I cannot easily find a chart going back before 1960, but from this chart, <a href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USexportsgs1960-2004.gif\" title=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USexportsgs1960-2004.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USexportsgs1960-2004.gif</a> , it is pretty clear that one thing that happened was a rapid acceleration of international trade.  I prefer globalization as the main cause of the trend, and I think it explains the main characteristics of the current situation.<br/><br/>There are two other main narratives presented to explain the same data.  One is that greedy financiers at the top stole wealth from the middle class through greed and nefarious means, enabled by lax regulations.  The other is that through cooption of the government, rich oligarchs protected their positions at the top, and used government connections to enrich themselves.  Both of these explanations are much to involved and complicated in my opinion, no matter how satisfying they may be to those who believe them.<br/><br/>[Part 2 to follow.]", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3331212, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 6698584, "replies": [], "commentID": 6701433, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "Common sense", "createDate": "1343136269", "userID": 9370, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1343137365", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "John Prokos", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1343133765", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "While I am not proud of America's invasion of Iraq, I will take our way of life over the rampant corruption, religious extremism, and tribalism that extists throughout that part of the world."}]}, "lft": 212, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/world/middleeast/iraqi-insurgents-kill-dozens-in-wave-of-attacks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 6698584, "rgt": 215, "userDisplayName": "John Prokos", "createDate": "1343102311", "userID": 25975158, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1343102970", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Nepal", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1343099370", "commentSequence": 52, "commentBody": "There is no vision in these comments.

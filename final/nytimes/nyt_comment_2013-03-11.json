It certainly outlines a case, based on analysis of the resurrected study, that it might be best to avoid polyunsaturated oils.  But, it does not even address the issue of not consuming oils.  You also say that the conclusion at the end of the article does not discuss whether or not to add oil to one's food.  But, Dr.Calder, whose e-mail is summarized at the article's end, does say that the new analysis might lead some to recommend lowering the consumption of vegetable oils and substituting animal fats but that he was not ready to conclude that at this point.  <br/><br/>Finally, one of the study groups actually continued their regular diet which consisted of about 15 percent saturated fat.  Presumably this could have included saturated oils.

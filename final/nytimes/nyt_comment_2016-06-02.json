I was the first in my family to attend college.  I had no help to prepare me for any facet of college life, and I attended a selective private school.  Once in college there were no remedial classes, and there shouldn't be, that's not what college is for. If you need remedial classes you have no business being in college, period. Go back to high school or community college and work harder. I worked like a dog in college, with two reading- and writing- intensive majors and a foreign language minor, in the era where papers still needed to be written on typewriters...much more labor intensive.  I got a few bad grades as a freshman, but I plowed on. Dropping out was not something I ever considered.  I am amazed at the lack of resilience of today's generation, where transferring and dropping out are the first responses to adversity.  Today plenty of schools have watered down the requirements for a degree.  A college degree is easy to get, but a college education is still hard to earn...it only comes after the application of great effort.  There are no shortcuts and it cannot be faked, because the result is no less than personal transformation.  If that doesn't occur, you didn't try hard enough.  Those who can't commit to do their best at college are fooling themselves and would be better off not going.

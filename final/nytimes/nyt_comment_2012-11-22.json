Until either the current leadership is persuaded that peace is in their best interest, or until such leadership is replaced with moderates who actually want a two-state solution, any agreements will be short lived. <br/><br/>My test for whether leaders are interested in peace is whether they follow the following three steps: (1) acknowledge that both sides, Israelis and Palestinians, have valid claims at stake - namely, the right to a country with security and economic freedom. (2) the blame game is pointless because there is more than enough blame to go around - illegal Israeli settlements and harsh policies towards the Palestinian people, Palestinian support (direct or tacit) of terrorism and denial of Israel's right to exist, too much violence by both sides. (3) work for a two state solution, based on 1967 borders with land swaps and shared access to Jerusalem; international security; and significant economic aid to rebuild Palestine. <br/><br/>The US should be using its significant financial aid to Israel, the Palestinians, and neighboring countries to get moderates who support these three points to the table, and to isolate the extremists on both sides who are acting in bad faith.

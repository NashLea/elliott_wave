The team's always had a very loyal, die-hard fan base.

Remember this team had rebuilt to the point of having CC Sabathia and Cliff Lee, just entering into their primes, and they sold the players off. Now Indians fans get to look around the league and see what their rebuilding period loyalty got them.<br/><br/>Finally, though most of us reading this aren't from Ohio or Cleveland necessarily, it's not that tough to think back exactly one year: The Indians were great for the first half of last season (I believe they led the AL in wins through May), and just as they began to generate some buzz within the city, they completely folded after the All-Star break. With the exception of the new catcher, Santana, Shin-Soo Choo and Perez, they also have no real stars.<br/><br/>The part that probably hurts most for the team is the huge number of empty seats in Jacobs Field.

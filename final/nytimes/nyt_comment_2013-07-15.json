When the results lead to american deaths from malnutrition, I wish all those who voted for this could be charged with treason, and hang from the gallows.

Rand\u2019s Objectivism maintains that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness/rational self-interest, and that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism.  First, taking a long-term perspective, I don\u2019t think that pursuing wealth as an overriding goal with no moral/ethical compass (as we seem to see so often today), while creating a deeply troubled underclass, is in any way acting in one\u2019s rational self-interest; the wealth dichotomy will eventually tear apart society, and as we have seen elsewhere in the world, a society rife with unrest cannot be in the self-interest of any but perhaps the weapons manufacturers.  Second, certainly no part of our government can lay claim to allowing, or even encouraging, the pursuit of laissez-faire capitalism; the government has more meddling layers of favoritism and special interests than there are stars in the galaxy.  Feel free to quote Orwell or Huxley, who sit laughing over their heavenly poker game as they observe our predicted earthly shenanigans; regardless of the popular rhetoric, our government, at the point of a gun I might add, has never allowed Rand to enter the equation.

Sundhage must give her help. And she must sit Boxx, who'll be roadkill in this match. Actually, make that 3 problems: lack of creativity. Cheney IMO is our best playmaker, but she's better in the middle -- so why is she stuck out on the wing? Especially the left wing, where she's supposed to screen LePeilbet in defense (but instead drifts inside)?<br/><br/>Everyone talks about Marta and Cristiane, but Rosana's got my Goal of the Tournament so far (for its improbable degree of difficulty against excellent defending), Fabiana has quite the afterburner, and Erika just showed us what she can do. Obviously we can't focus on just one player, and in the chaotic style they play it isn't always clear where the attack will come from. OTOH they start off slow and confused in that disorganized mess of a 343 and need a half to sort things out; I'm sure we'll get our chances, especially early.

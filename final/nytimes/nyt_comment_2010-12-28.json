While he is obsessed with mathematics, for which he has a freakishly extraordinary talent, and will almost surely follow in certain family footsteps to become a research mathematician, he is unusual in that he is also preoccupied with philosophy and literature.<br /><br />I say with pride that he scorns what he recently characterized as \"the intellectual ghetto\" (!) of so-called \"children's\" and \"teen\" literature.  He obviously detests these unsubtle, hectoring ideological pamphlets, despite his mother's unfortunate employment at a city library which seems to have an infinite supply of these whiny, lecturing, and invariably hard-left politicized texts.<br /><br />On Thanksgiving, I made him an early gift of two superb books: Matt Ridley's \"The Rational Optimist,\" and Boswell's great and terrible \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" in the beautiful compact Everyman's edition.  His reaction to these -- which he has devoured in a mere month -- confirmed my hopes in the best and most brilliant of this young generation, to wit:<br /><br />It appears he found a passage in Boswell that has thrilled him at the deepest, philosophical level; the awesome passage where Johnson so memorably enjoins Boswell to \"clear your mind of cant.\"  Since I have  quoted this very passage rather boorishly on too many occasions over the long dinnered years, I was particularly delighted to see it strike afresh the mind of one so young and brilliant.<br /><br />He has already gotten into trouble in \"soft classes\" at his (supposedly superb, in truth mediocre) school for accusing the teachers of \"spouting cant.\"  Since even in this context of the gifted (and pampered) his brilliance is commanding, the teachers are left with little to do except gape as the boy trots out study after fact after study after fact that make a mockery of their cherished  \"environmentalist\" canards and shibboleths.<br /><br />He would never tolerate the *cant* that is spoon-fed to \"children\" and \"teens\" by the sinister texts we\u2019re discussing here.  He sees this nihilism for what it is and rejects it utterly.  I regret I will not see his maturity, but I am confident it will be known to many as an exemplary life of truth-seeking.

However losing optimism is not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, for many (if not most) Americans, it may be a good thing.  We have been for too long a \"feel good\" culture, using denial as our main defense. (No, nothing terrible will happen to us again.  We will find a way to ensure our safety.  This after the 9/11 attacks.)  Little did we realize that the terrorism we were about to experience was not about airplanes hitting Trade Towers and the Pentagon, but about precipitously losing jobs and, as time went on, hope of finding decent employment.  At this point, I think many Americans are completely out of denial and, perhaps, able to see the truth of our corporate dominated culture. More people realize our government stands for and by the richest and greediest among us. Period.<br /><br />This is a sad truth.

To that I would say that we were obviously  watching two different channels or , god forbid, he is holding Mrs Clinton to a different standard than other male candidates.  I was perfectly pleased that her face remained calm and passive.  There were points toward the end when Mr Trump was going on about birthism that she looked ready to pounce that I turned to my friends and said, \"that is the face that an anti Hillary person will love\" but she also reminded me of my own parents/grandparents in that calm collective expression that is letting you have your say before calmly explaining that there may be more to an issue than you are aware BUT it is still worth the time to let you have your say.  There is no \"sigh or checking your watch\" moment and if there was I would calmly and nicely say to Mr Brooks that he should have been paying as much attention to the disengaged, petulant, and bored face of Mr Trump instead of looking for what everyone was afraid would happen, the informed person condescending to the uniformed person in Mrs Clinton which did show up in Mr Trump.

However, I have to question whether they are beginning a \"Grand Experiment\" with this captive group of poor folk or are they basing their decision on some study in an effort to provide the best quality of care for their patients.  No where in this article do I see any citations of any studies for their actions.  I do have problems with the possibility that this is becoming an unfunded, unauthorized study with uncertain outcomes for those who have been given no choice.", "recommendationCount": 13}, {"assetID": 3229220, "replies": [], "lft": 456, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/us/politics/democrats-in-congress-balking-at-obamas-jobs-bill.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4519095, "rgt": 457, "userDisplayName": "finchdog", "createDate": "1316057671", "userID": 15617077, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1316060678", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seattle", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1316057078", "commentSequence": 173, "commentBody": "The only way we are going to get a jobs program from this Congress is to take a leaf from the ancient Pharaohs.

Its obvious, whether its GOP or conservative DLC Dem, we cannot appeal to their patriotism or their humanity. But we can appeal to their sacred ideologies and self-serving principles.  <br/><br/>We could put everyone in the country back to work if someone could just figure out how to model the expansive egos of these public servants.  Probably not enough construction materials at hand to build it to life size scale. I'm sure we could pass some deregulation and allow these monuments to be build with the organic material we find in pastures.

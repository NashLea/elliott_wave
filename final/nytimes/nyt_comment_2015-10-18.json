He has done nothing to stop the violent reactions to a rumor about Israel changing rules involving prayer around the Al Aqsa Mosque, and at a minimum has tacitly approved the ensuing violence.<br/><br/>This follows similar failures by Arafat, who encouraged the Intifadas, which ended up depriving Palestinians of access to Israel for jobs, making their economic situation more dire, as well as increasing hostility and insecurity, thus making statehood less likely.  <br/><br/>Abbas had the audacity to agitate further by lying about the execution of a young Palestinian who stabbed a 13 year old Israeli on a bike multiple times.  His claim that this Palestinian boy was executed by Israelis, when in reality the boy was recovering in Hadassah Hospital, again demonstrated his misguided desire to win the PR battle, while losing the statehood war.

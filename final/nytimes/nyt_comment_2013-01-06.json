Violence towards women is a learned behavior, based on an entitlement belief system in which the perpetrator justifies using any and all means to take from women anything he wants.

The Mets have done that over and over and over again since the early 00's and it really hasn't worked out that well, has it?  <br/><br/>All fans want to see their team buy the best free agent players in the off-season and be contenders next year.  But it doesn't work unless you've got the cash flow to buy every one of the necessary players or you've got just about all the other players in place already. For the Mets, the situation is exacerbated by the Wilpon's financial troubles and the massive financial obligations that come with the new stadium. Consequently, the Mets only real choice is to rebuild the team on the budget they have.  <br/><br/>Under Alderson, the Mets are finally adopting a rebuilding strategy and trading R.A. Dickey was a major part of it.  The Mets grasped the fact that if they kept Dickey they'd likely have a winning pitcher for a few seasons but without much of an increased chance of having a winning team.  <br/><br/>Accordingly, the Mets decided to trade Dickey at peak market value for a set of prospects who can provide a decade or more of talented play in some of the most important positions the Mets need help with. It was a disappointment to those of us who love R.A., but it was a no-brainer from a med to long term managerial perspective. Even if it doesn't work out at all, the Dickey trade was a chance the Mets absolutely had to take."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 8003035, "replies": [], "commentID": 8025781, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Paul", "createDate": "1357703306", "userID": 34677113, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1357706975", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 3, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Paul", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bellerose Terrace", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1357706975", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "@DD: I understand your point, but Dickey was traded for a AA pitcher and a AAA catcher who already has had back and knee issues that cost him half of last season. It seems like rebuilding, but by the time the field players are replenished, where will Niese, Gee and even Harvey be? It requires bringing the elements *together.* Dickey, at his age, might have another three year deal beyond the one he sought from the Mets, and which they never pursued when separated by $5M over two years. And where will Wright be when the rest of the field prospects are ready, and, other than D'Arnaud, WHO are they?<br/>\nSandomir did a lot more than make a simple implication that the Mets might spend in his article, and not a peep since. But there is NOTHING in the Mets' actions that back up Sandomir's claim. Look, I KNOW the Wilponzis are broke. I just can't fathom why they just can't sell and just go away. The payroll has shrunk by 50% since Madoff exploded. Even the Yankee$ Quixotic attempt to get to a $189M payroll threshhold for next year doesn't represent NEARLY the level of payroll cut the Mets have made, second only to the Marlins.<br/>\nEmpty seats at Citi, and lots of them, unless the young pitchers thrive, Santana is back to being an ace, and some outfielders and relief pitchers come out of the corn, like in Field of Dreams.

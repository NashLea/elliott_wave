The arguments based on inference, similarly, do not persuade.<br /><br />The problem I see with \"prohibitionism,\" however, relates to its affective component. If I follow your argument, prohibitionism centers on the state of mind of the slur's immediate recipient who has taken \"offense\" at an utterance that defames himself and his self-identified group. I don't think the recipient's offense, his sense of having been defamed, or his feelings of having his self-identified group attacked by a term freighted with hatred should have anything to do with why slurs should be avoided. In other words, it may be nasty and despicable to call a person a loathsome term, but the reason we should not use slurs has nothing to do with shielding the recipient offense or to spare his feelings.<br /><br />It seems to me, rather, that as a society we have chosen to attempt to discourage certain classes of deliberate slights because they are an offense to the community at large. Following from this, your \"Rush Hour\" example fails the test; and \"in-group\" slurs similarly should not be immunized and, rationally, should be proscribed as well.

Liberals today who criticize Obama should remember \"the dilemma that any principled politician must face - the inherent tension between the ideal and the impossible\".  Lincoln had to keep the North at least behind him. Too bad that Stauffer in his petty critique of Lincoln failed to point out that the radical abolitionists NEVER would have won an election, much less been able to govern.<br />The slave south then reminds me of the republicans today - they viciously attack the moderate stance, and demand everything. In the Fugitive Slave law, they demanded federal power over the states because it was in their favor.  Remember this whenever anyone says the North did not fight for human freedom.  The slave south demanded federal control over states rights when the states would have given human freedom.<br />Lincoln called the Fugitive Slave law atrocious and like many in the north hated this law.  But we rely on the rule of law, and all officials, from Lincoln on down, were required to enforce it.  The bitter complaints about this were a major cause of secession, as the slave south knew the Fugitive Slave law could not last.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2223357, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/ghosts-of-a-christmas-past/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3131956, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "Richniques", "createDate": "1293204318", "userID": 53384976, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293254306", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Toronto, ON, Canada", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293254306", "commentSequence": 13, "commentBody": "I Love this Series Just Amazing look into time .", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 2223357, "replies": [], "lft": 32, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/ghosts-of-a-christmas-past/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3131987, "rgt": 33, "userDisplayName": "Scott", "createDate": "1293205161", "userID": 56938510, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293254344", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Iowa", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293254344", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "Christmas is by no means a joyous freedom many suppose, they have this ideal and also the reality.

The article states that slaves abounded in that period. Who cannot say we have our form of slavery in our midst, where people are bound to things that require their attention constantly--slaves were no less attended to vigorously.

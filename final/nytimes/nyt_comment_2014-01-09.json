It's a lie to claim the battle was fought and lost--those battles we fought, we won. Those we didn't fight, indeed, have shown no improvement. Beautiful that you've twisted that into evidence against trying. Tell me, what, besides SS, Medicare and Medicaid (which is always being cut, little by little), still constitutes the War on Poverty? TANF is a shadow of its former self (thankfully, as it was a partial, though not complete, cause of what you mention--Moynihan's scissors and all). SNAP provides some food (not much, but enough to prevent some malnutrition and starvation), but not much money goes into each. So where is this war we're fighting, where the failures?

It now takes two wage earners or more to support a middle-class lifestyle. That flooded the market with new workers, depressed wages and added to the corporate/labor imbalance. The resulting stress on the family is the source of the decay. Now unemployment benefits, food stamps, and health care policies from Republicans are attempting to generate a free labor pool that along with additional tax policies would push that shift even further to corporate benefit.

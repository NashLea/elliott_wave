I made two points. First, a motley assortment of lefties, defeatists, pacifists, and Democrats incessantly assured us that violence in Iraq was caused by the presence of U.S. troops and violence would end with the withdrawal of those troops. Well, the troops are gone but sadly not the violence. Along these lines allow me to refer to a 2008 quote from candidate Obama, \" let's not leave Iraq as stupidly as we got int Iraq \". My second point is that the Obama \" resets \" have seemed to go awry; e.g. Libya, Russia, Syria, the pivot ( has there really been such? ) to Asia. The implication of this point is that possibly Obama is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier when it comes to foreign policy.

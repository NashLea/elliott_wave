Of course there are many dedicated teachers who give of themselves day in and out.<br/><br/>When I was growing up a few decades ago, we had simple textbooks and blackboards and in a parochial school we learned, some excelled.  What is so often missing from discussion about education in the United States is the huge influence parents and siblings have on their children, and the attitudes given children by the parents is profound, attitudes likely already formed in most children by the time they have arrived at school.  Many children with little interest in learning and little encouragement at home, and those with poor boundaries around other children, create a chaotic learning environment for all.  It is unfair to place the burden of motivation solely on teachers.<br/><br/>What needs to happen, in my view, is a fundamental societal shift toward embracing learning, and rather than label intelligent children 'nerds', have leadership in our country which shows education in its most positive light.

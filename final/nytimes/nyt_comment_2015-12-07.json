That's why gun violence is comparatively rare in France, and why it took a concerted, international conspiracy to smuggle guns into France:  you can't get them there, so you have to buy them in Belgium.  <br/><br/>The lesson of San Bernardino is that easy access to guns means more deaths.  And spare me the nonsense about California's \"restrictive\" gun laws: you can't speak of meaningful gun control when anyone can get a military grade semi-automatic weapon on demand and give it his neighbor. If California's laws are the toughest in the nation, it's only because the bar is so low.  ", "recommendationCount": 16}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

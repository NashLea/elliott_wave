Back in 1994 I did an almost complete changeover with incentives from my electric company.  The cost to me was almost zero with the incentives at that time. There are some minor problems with them these days, but if one doesn't buy the absolute cheapest Chinese bulbs and pays attention to color temperature and color rendering index, one can easily buy a suitable CFL bulb. Those early bulbs I got (1994) were very descent in terms of color and their quality was very high (being of American and European manufacture).<br/><br/>Since then, I've moved on  to LED for many of my light bulbs, starting in 2007. There was a learning curve, both on my part and the manufacturers' part. In the not too distant future, LED should be the predominate technology. Same issues as CFL  with color and quality at the present time.<br/><br/>As to incandescents being banned, they aren't. First, there are exemptions for special purpose bulbs, such as oven and refrigerator use. Also for low wattage bulbs. Even for high wattage bulbs, incandescent bulbs aren't banned entirely, only low efficiency ones. I've noticed stores starting to stock halogen incandescents to replace standard incandescents in large quantities now. I started converting to halogens even before I started converting to compact fluorescents... back in the 1980s.

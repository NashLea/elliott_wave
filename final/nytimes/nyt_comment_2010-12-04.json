The latter fares should actually not be sold to the general public online due to airline marketing restrictions, but some sites such as Vayama and Cheapoair sell them nonetheless. The way airlines want you to purchase private fares is by calling your local travel agent who has a consolidator contract, and not online, since airlines themselves want to dominate the web and are doing everything possible to kill online travel agents.<br /><br />In order to make my search for international cheap flights as quick and easy as possible I typically use just two websites:<br />- <a href=\"http://www.kayak.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.kayak.com</a><br />- <a href=\"http://www.bt-store.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bt-store.com</a><br /><br />Kayak is not an online travel agent, but a meta search engine, where all major airlines and websites, including Vayama and Cheapoair participate by providing real-time data feeds to Kayak. Therefore, using Kayak typically covers almost all deals available in real time.<br /><br />The other website I like to use for researching cheap flights is Best Travel Store (<a href=\"http://www.bt-store.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.bt-store.com</a>). They are an online travel agency which is not as large as the other guys, but they offer some excellent deals from time to time, apparently by using their own search engine, as they claim on their website. I like their seat maps and seat booking capability, and most importantly they display full fare rules, so that you know exactly the airline restrictions of the fare you purchase. This is very important when you try to change or cancel a flight, since agents are bound by the fare rules they display to you, while you could be made to think you purchased a non-refundable or non-changeable fare when you buy airline tickets with agents who hide these rules from you. You could thus lose hundreds of dollars in residual value if the selling agent is not bound by fare rules of your particular purchase \u2013 when they do not display these rules to you at the time of purchase.<br /><br />When airline and online travel agent fares are very similar consider purchasing directly with the airline in order to avoid change and cancellation service fees that are typically imposed by travel agents due to administrative overhead required to handle such itinerary modifications. Remember to read fare rules in order to learn about these changes. It is also worth considering the fact that it might sometimes be easier to handle changes and cancellations through a smaller travel agent vs. a large airline, but this really depends on the quality and knowledge of agent customer service that you should familiarize yourself with before purchase.<br /><br />Some savvy online bloggers and forum participants also state an important fact: when things go wrong with your flight, such as a strike or bad weather, a good travel agent is absolutely invaluable in finding you alternative flights. Airlines work to minimize their costs by sometimes putting you on the worst flights with no compensation, and an experienced agent can make a world of difference by fighting with the airline on your behalf.<br /><br />It is important to understand that some providers on Kayak are trying to cheat the system. For example Cheapoair is advertising lower fares on their first page and then jacks up the fare on the next page, where the higher fare including their service fees and some taxes is displayed almost in small print. The reason websites use this tactic is because they want to display the lowest fare to you on Kayak so that they come out as the top result, which gets the vast majority of clicks (if you are not first you are not anywhere). This deceptive practice is illegal according to US law but it looks like no one really bothers to prosecute it.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is to actually proceed to the reservation confirmation page, by leaving Kayak for the destination provider website in order to ensure that the advertised itinerary and fare is actually available. Some Kayak participants, such as Orbitz, sometimes use very outdated flight seat availability information in order to provide you with the lowest fare that has already been sold out hours ago. Therefore, don\u2019t take the fares displayed on Kayak for granted, click to log on to the destination website to verify the advertised flight.<br /><br />It is a myth that you can somehow cheat the system by storing cheap flight results in your browser and booking later, unless the online seller has some serious issues with the website. Each fare must be verified for accuracy in real time when you make your online reservation, and any fare stored in your browser just won\u2019t do the trick.<br /><br />Finally, consider that buying package deals, where you combine your flight together with a hotel could really save you a lot of money if you buy with the right website or your local travel agent.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2145355, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/a-silicon-bubble-shows-signs-of-reinflating/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2934574, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "NMA", "createDate": "1291435082", "userID": 12017788, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1291438855", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1291438855", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "What a lot of people don\u2019t realize, is that when you raise that much money as a startup, your expectations become that much higher.

My brother and I have recently been looking into Nicaragua for a sustainable tourism project, specifically the area of San Juan del Sur. We went down there last spring break and absolutely fell in love!! I\u00b4ve heard its a booming tousim hot spot, and especially welcoming for fellas looking to set up hotels, like msyelf. Not only is Nicaragua easy on the wallet, but there are ample untouched areas to explore. Problem is, I'm a rookie at doing business in Latin America. Any idea how to get started??

The professor also has noted - again and again - that the time for government to spend is when the private sector is not, and to cut back when the private sector is running at full production, in other words, replace a government $ with a private sector dollar. Trouble is the call for cutting now when the private sector has shown no inclination to spend more. Which isn't because the government is spending (note that the sequester has further cut discretionary spending that has already been cur under Obama) too much, but that no one is spending enough.for evidence, not the billions on corporate balance sheets - why would they use that money if they don't have demand?

It is refreshing to hear this instead of the assumption that Republican leadership just have a different method of a better economy. Rather as you point out, for the right, it is better for some people to fail and others to succeed regardless of the overall economy. However, it seems even Mr. Krugman takes the right's arguments seriously no matter how ridiculous the assertions. He should just assume if their proposals lead to a decline of the economy with some doing well, that is their intention.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that US liberals believe in empathy and that everyone should be empathetic to all those in need. The right wing just blames the losers and pushes for more rules to create even more losers. I would jettison empathy as a political tool and talk about ethics. It is unethical to cheat workers out of deserved benefits and reward profiteering on the misery of others. Don't ameliorate the conditions of the poor, just don't allow poverty.<br/><br/>In the past right wing economists railed against full employment as inflationary. Although this was not true, it was important to exploit the labor force. With unemployment insurance, labor still costs too much for them compared with a workforce suffering deprivation. <br/><br/>We must dispense with pushing empathy or facts on people who do not value others as much as themselves.

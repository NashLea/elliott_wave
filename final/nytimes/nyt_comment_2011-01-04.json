If they spent even half of their resources and effort on providing viable alternatives for women and couples with unwanted pregnancies, they would greatly reduce abortions. Those who reject the notion that poor women should become child bearers for rich women make a valid point, yet there are many women who would prefer to give a child up for adoption rather than abort their fetus.

Today, birth control is more available than it ever was and available without embarassment of purchasing and using such products.  Yet, why has the pregnancy rate soared for the young and unwed, those very people who used to give their babies up for adoption?  The American attitude toward sex needs to be changed -- yes, it's always noble to wait for marriage but since that doesn't happen, the reality is that birth control has to be used by all sexually active youth whether or not they want to use it.  Second, it's more prudent to give a teenage girl who smokes birth control pills than to allow her to smoke but have unprotected sex.  By unprotected sex, I mean NO USE OF BIRTH CONTROL, not just non-use of barrier methods that prevent STDs.  The old adage, \"It won't happen to me,\" is just that.  Abortion should be made available with federal funds because based on our founding fathers beliefs in a true separation of church and state, the issues surrounding prohibition of use of federal funding for indigent abortions deal with morality steeped in fundamentalist religious beliefs (i.e., the Republican Party).  If the government tied Food Stamps, WIC, General Public Assistance and abortion together, we would have fewer welfare recipients because the underclass would be forced to make some very difficult decisions.  Two children, no more.  Abortion for every child conceived after the second born to a welfare recipient.  Abortion for each and every unmarried woman on assistance who refuses to disclose the name of the sire of her unborn.  No job, no baby.  Girl wants baby, girl has to find every method possible to pay for baby outside of public assistance of any kind.  We've got to do something about procreation and an increase in welfare benefits.  That underclass can no longer be sustained.  Abortion should not be stigmatized.  It should be used wisely because the body can only take so much trauma, and be funded for indigents who may otherwise be unable to afford the procedure.  Cut the welfare benefits and watch how fast some wise up.  It's not a right to have children; it's a privilege.

My responses are these:<br /><br />I'm not asking medical science to stop progressing.  I'm asking it to take some thought to what its advances mean to the larger society, and to consider stopping extending life thoughtlessly without taking other issues into consideration.  Inheritances are being decimated as nursing homes take every last cent their patients have and then, when every last dime is gone, suddenly announce that \"we see no more point to this\" and suggest hospice care.  Yes, I know about the cries of \"death panels\" that will arise.  But the fact is, people ought to be able, while they still can with some choice and dignity, leave this life before ending up in said nursing homes for years having their diapers changed as they wander in mental darkness and everything they thought they could pass on to their heirs gone.  The appalling crisis in health care costs, INCLUDING the cost to the economy of people who become unemployed or less productive because of the stresses of caring for elders, is going to further undermine our national economy.<br /><br />Baby Boomers that I know are already stealthily planning their own exits, appealing to friends who are doctors for promises of help \"out\", as they watch what their own parents are going through in horror.  I know two doctors personally who have already grimly assured me that THEY have no intention of ending up in those nursing homes. . .<br /><br />Our technical advances have gotten ahead of our realities.  The result is neither humane nor productive in the processing of grief.  That is all I meant to say. And lost in this discussion is how incredibly expensive senior living facilities and nursing homes are, and how merciless Medicaid and the nursing home industry is in taking every dollar they can from ordinary people for whom the sale of a home was all they had to leave their children.  This issue, like so many others, does nothing but persuade us all that the only thing worth being in America is rich.  Unfortunatley, everyone can't be.<br /><br />Poster #9, thanks for your understanding.  This nation has GOT to find a way either to provide humane, less expensive care for this exploding population of helpless old people, or bite the bullet and offer people diagnosed with early dementia and Alzheimer's disease the chance to ease themselves out of life with dignith while they can still consider the matter.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 28}, {"assetID": 2245872, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/the-caregivers-bookshelf-as-the-goodbye-grows-longer/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3163262, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "her daughter", "createDate": "1294098301", "userID": 53169903, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294120854", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "northeast", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294120854", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "My mother and paternal aunt were end-of-life caregivers for their own parents.

I'm in the middle of this with an accomplished and distinguished father and a wonderful, compassionate mother, both of whom always put others ahead of their own interests, especially their children.  Now I am in the middle of a major success in the entertainment business with world travel, fame, and perhaps some fortune in the works, but I will be taking a week off as of Wednesday to just \"SIT\" with my father and mother to give my exhausted sister a week out of town with her husband, since she's taken the main load of care-giving to these 88-year-olds simply because of her proximitiy to them.  My father suffers from glaucoma and near total blindness, heart and circulatory problems (congestive heart failure and pneumonia in November), mild dementia (only thing we can figure is all-round vascular degeneration, cause nothing shows up on the MRIs or CATs), and probably worst of all, incontinence (forcing someone to get him to the toilet every hour on the hour at night), and my mother just can't keep up with it with advanced osteoarthritis, her own frayed neurons (gets pissed off at the drop of a hat now), a 4/7 cm aortic aneurism, and all that goes with this combination of ailments.<br /><br />As of September they went from a positive cashflow situation to a vacuum drain on their lifetime of savings and investments, which, amazingly, could be siphoned off in a year at the present rate of outflow.  I find it particularly amazing that two high-school educated \"sitters\" at $10.50 an hour could siphon off all their fixed monthly income (social security and retirement) just from their sitter hours, and when you add another shift to the mix, it's all negative flow (along with the utilties, food, and other meager expenses (I'm sorry- didn't mean to include prescriptions as meager expenses).  I'm going to spend a week to try and stop the monetary bleeding as much as possible while trying to help these wonderful people find a few rewarding moments in their daily lives.  After all, that's what we want most of all at this point, don't we?  Just give them some day-to-day happiness of some kind as diversions to the overwhelming reality that their lives are coming to a rather miserable end.  Skyping the great-grandchildren who are living in Europe nowadays, a granddaughter in California working on her PhD, reading a few newspaper highlights to them, making a good bowl of soup for lunch... these are the highlights of our caretaker's association with them now.  I just wondering if the rope guideline to the toilet for night time calls, the wrist-strapped flashlight for security, and the whistle and airhorn alarm gimicks I have come up with will be enough to allow my dad to reclaim his independence enough at night to shave off the $2500 / month night sitter that we currently employ.  Maybe for awhile.<br /><br />We already have authority over all financial and health-related decisions for both parents.  Will we use that authority eventually to make decisions that go against the basic desires of the persons who gave us that authority in anticipation of their own gradual demise?  Will I be faced with telling my mother or father that their assets are now gone, and it's time to sell the house and move to a home under state care and Medicaid, because there's nothing left to cover their ability to stay in their own home anymore? Whether or not it happens to us (and it indeed may), there are thousands of folks in this position right now, and it just ain't right.  If the richest country in the world doesn't have a plan for a letting the core of its citizenry grow old with dignity, then there really isn't much hope for everyone else out there, is there?

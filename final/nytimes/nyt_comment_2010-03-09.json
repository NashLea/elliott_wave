That started happening when the Flyers dominated the game, as Colin Campbell recalls in this post, and it grew as helmets became more common and then mandatory.<br /><br />There is a lot of controversy surrounding hip checks because some people think they target the knees. There was a move a few years ago to outlaw them, but it didn't pass.  Still if a player comes in too low and does target the knees, sometimes you see officials call that. Actually, hip checking is sort of a lost art and I think that's because the puck carriers are traveling at such a high rate of speed, it's hard to time it right; hip checks are all about timing. And I think that's another reason hits got higher, because it's easier for a defender to make contact with the puckcarrier using his upper body.<br /><br />I think the owners and the GMs are, to some extent, caught between two fears on this question. On one hand, they don't want their players concussed, that's for certain, if only because their players are their biggest assets. On the other hand, I do think there is a real fear in some quarters that the game will get soft if the league moves too far legislating head checks, and they do want to preserver the physical character of the game.<br /><br />As every one knows, when you get two conflicting schools of thought like that, there's a chance they will negate each other and a standoff will result. So if nothing happens at the end of all this, it may not be because the owners don't respect the players as much as they can't come to a consensus on what action to take.<br /><br />Thanks for your comment.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1237502, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/11-down-chewy-confection/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1671418, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "Suzy M.", "createDate": "1268113210", "userID": 51706499, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268113262", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Durham CT", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268113262", "commentSequence": 11, "commentBody": "Thanks, Dan F - I went back to yesterday's blog and saw that you and others had offered some good advice on speed-solving, and accurate solving in general.

For  young people, it speaks to where they really live; who they are.  And gets them interested in reading, finally.<br /><br />Eventually, we would hope, they will go on to read nonfiction.

Fiction is an escape, really, from what they have to read all the time, for school.<br /><br />And again, in a way fiction can be (in some cases) not escapist; but can really be the most realistic and helpful - and factual - education of all.

You find a quiet corner after much viewing and rest with your book....You remember another part that confused you and go to reread that.  You get on the very crowded tram and have no place to sit, but it's easy to just put the book in front of you and take up where you left off.<br /><br />You never had to think about thieves, internet access, tired shoulders...not once.<br /><br />Shall I go on?", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1236429, "replies": [], "lft": 140, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/hey-friend-do-you-like-my-sad-story/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1671038, "rgt": 141, "userDisplayName": "Ivo Quartiroli", "createDate": "1268107526", "userID": 55020833, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268127077", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Milan, Italy", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268127077", "commentSequence": 67, "commentBody": "As Neil Postman said 'technology imperiously commandeers our most important terminology.

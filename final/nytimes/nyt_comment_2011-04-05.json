Men who spend the same amount of time out of the work face magnified challenges.  Women who stay at home with the children might be less common today but still meets a social/gender norm.  Men who do so face a variety of judgment by employers for  holding a role that goes against all traditional roles for men.  \r<br/><br/>The sabbatical angle degrades the importance and positive impact upon children\u2019s lives of stay at home parents.  There may be data and research that says day care for infants and toddlers is \u201cok\u201d but believe that parents-either gender-in the home during the early years has a positve and profound impact upon their development.  I believe this positive influence also impacts the life of the  stay at home parent as well. \r<br/><br/>Returning to any work, let alone one previous career field, is a challenge for all stay at home parents regardless of gender. It has been interesting experiencing the long list of double standards faced by husbands/fathers who become voluntarily unemployed/leave a career in order to care for the children, support their wife\u2019s career, the family and keep the children out of day care.  Although this family dynamic might be a small segment in society, some women might care to remind themselves that as difficult as their challenges are transitioning back to work, and I say this as gently as possible, you have no idea the difficulties men face. \r<br/><br/>I neither regret nor choose to re-label my time caring for my children.  Caring for one\u2019s children is not something that needs to be falsely titled and believe most employers would find it strange if not a distortion of reality.  If anything, what this post reaffirms is that caring and nurturing ones children is downgraded to something that has to be labeled as something other than what it is.<br/>\nI find it a sad reflection on society when women have to rebrand the time they took off work/career and cared for their children and family. \r", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 2595856, "replies": [], "lft": 46, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/the-disappearing-school-nurse/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3640769, "rgt": 47, "userDisplayName": "JH", "createDate": "1301971274", "userID": 56864386, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1301976384", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1301972784", "commentSequence": 23, "commentBody": "This is horrifying.

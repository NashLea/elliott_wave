There will be climate change, but we don't know what changes there will be or how fast they will occur.  Al Gore did all kinds of damage by referring to this as \"settled science\".  In fact, climate science is more of the most rapidly evolving fields, and very little or nothing is settled.  That business about a warmer Arctic makes for colder mid-latitude winters:  that may well be true, but the explanation has an ad hoc and post hoc air to it.  More importantly, the fact that this theory is only now being offered shows the science is nothing like settled.  So every statement must be qualified.<br /><br />The effects are if anything even less certain:  Just on the issue of food supply:  Some places will be drier and others wetter.  The growing season in higher latitudes will expand.  In the US, the drier SoCal climate may move north, and the Sonoma Desert may move north from the Mexican border; the Southeast will probably be wetter.  This will likely cause water shortages in California, but these can be alleviated by more efficient forms of irrigation (briefly, drip for ditch) and, if it comes to that, by cutting back on agro use.  Meanwhile, the Midwest, Upper South, Northern Plains and southern Canada may well become more fertile.  The net effect on North American food production is not known, not even whether it'll be positive or negative.  Meanwhile, we know a good deal more about North American agro than we do about Africa, Southeast Asia or Latin America.<br /><br />This is just food.  Every other issue is similarly complex and shot through with unknowns.  It probably pays to keep an open mind.<br /><br />This is not to say that I think burning coal like there's no tomorrow is the ideal strategy.  Switching to non-carbon fuels would be prudent, to say the least, but people are not going to do it if it means doubling or tripling their energy costs.  I've costed out solar power installation here in California, and it's not an attractive proposition, even with all the subsidies.  This is also true on the international level--think back to Copenhagen if you doubt this.<br /><br />The right way to go is to make this technology effective, and then people will adopt it naturally, without having to be dragooned into it.  I'd be thrilled to support that, and I'd be happy if the governing patents were in the public domain.

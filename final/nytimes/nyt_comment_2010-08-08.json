That is how teacher's retirement is figured. Adding insult to injury in the equation is the issue of social security. Even if a teacher has earned the 40 credits outside of the teaching profession, they are not allowed to collect social security. Their pension is deducted from any social security they are eligible for and that works out to zero social security for teachers. I continue to work after retirement and continue to pay in to social security even though I will never be able to collect it.<br />There is a reason the rich folks are going after pensions and notice you are seeing the attacks in every form of media. First the pensions, then social security and finally unions. Unions have an organizational structure to fight back. During the Age of Industry unions were illegal because they 'interferred' with the profits of corporations. Those of you writing against your own best interests would do well to remember the rich will pick us off one group at a time until there is no one left to fight. Think they can't do it?

war being waged in this country between corporate America and the poor, and the working and middle classes.Millions of Americans working for corporations watched helplessly as their defined pension plans were eliminated and switched to 401k plans.The result is that  retirees and workers faced devastating  financial losses during the Great Recession.Now,corporate America is pitting the average American worker who no longer receives a pension through their job against the cops,teachers,firemen, and other public workers lucky enough to have a pension and blaming the state and local workers for the trillion dollar pension gap.However,the truth is that our governors and representatives  caused this trillion dollar gap because they did not fully fund the pensions even in good times.Instead,to buy votes they redirected the funding of the pensions to lower taxes or  used the money on other spending.As mentioned in the article,in many states public employees do not receive Social Security or Medicare.Not mentioned in the piece is that public employees often have to contribute to their pensions and pay for their medical insurance when they retire.In Connecticut, teachers pay 7% of their gross into the pension plan and when a teacher retires,he must pay for approximately $14,000 a year for husband and wife medical coverage.And like most other workers, public employees do not have the skills or the money to invest in the stock market and the state and local governments do not match employee contributions to 413b plans.What's so scary is that big business has eliminated pensions for its workers and now wants to do the same for public employees.Trillions for endless wars and tax cuts aimed at the wealthiest.Blank checks to bail out Wall St.Two thirds of businesses do not pay any federal taxes including obscenely profitable companies like Exxon Mobile.Billions spent on taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and other corporate welfare programs.Yet,Ron Lieber begrudges the $2883 a month pension the Colorado teacher receives.One more point.On a teacher's salary,better yet, on the average workers' salary, there is no way that a family could save the almost $1,000,0000 needed to buy an annuity to provide a decent retirement income.Really, the workers of this country should be demanding defined pension plans from a corporate America sitting on $1.8

In good times instead of fully funding these pensions with the extra funds those funds went to pet projects that would help the politicians get reelected. Perhaps these same politicians would give up their benefit packages along with a pay cut to help fund the obligation they have to previous employees.<br />Once the public has a contract with someone they are obligated to pay on that contract.  All the deals that politicians may have made to corporations to limit the corporations tax exposure should be rescinded to pay for the obligations the public took on.<br />These public employees live and spend their in the area that they earned it.  By cutting these funds these retired employees will cut back on their spending and cause businesses to close.<br />There are too many problems that arise but the most important thought is that once you make a promise you are obligated to keep it.

This semester I am carrying 17 credits, and I only spent 55 dollars on books (granted, I am not taking any hard sciences or math). One of the best resources I have found for cheap books is the student book exchange that takes place on our campus at the beginning of every semester. A student group organizes the sale - they just keep a 10% commission. I often go and just browse for my own personal collection -- people are always desperate to sell their old English books, so I get a lot of the classics for $2 each!

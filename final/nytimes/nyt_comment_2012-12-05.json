The UN resolution was another Arab attempt to avoid direct negotiations with the Israelis, who are there after winning a defensive war  in 1967. <br/><br/>Understanding situations and formulating viewpoints begin with semantics; the word you use for that land - \"occupied\", \"disputed\" or \"liberated\" (there indeed was once a sovereign Jewish state there)  will inevitably color your viewpoint. Being against a Palestinian State today is a very unpopular viewpoint. The preponderance of Arabs in the world makes that inevitable.

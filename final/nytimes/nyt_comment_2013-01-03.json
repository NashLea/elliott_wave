MSG for instance has a basketball capacity of just over 19,000 and a hockey capacity of just over 18,000.  Red Bulls arena in contrasts seats 25,000 at full capacity.  So clearly MLS matches have the potential to draw a larger crowd than any NBA/NHL game can.<br/><br/>So while it may be true, and a good omen for the sport that MLS averages 18,807 in attendance per game, the stat about NBA/NHL attendance is being offered out of context.  Think of it this way, it would similarly be misleading to offer total attendance numbers as a gauge of the relative viability of each sport, when the NBA season is more than twice as long as the MLS season.

You don't know any better than I do if either is true, but you make a good point that decent leadership ought to have options for either problem other than just going home.   <br/><br/>However, the NYT can fairly be tasked to report if these things are true.  <br/><br/>Was it doubled by pork?  Did the GOP demand cuts as a price for emergency assistance?  When the NYT weighs in, it really can call on the resources to tell us.  <br/><br/>If they are lying again, then their noses can be rubbed in it, and the editorial would be stronger.  <br/><br/>If either of these things are true, then they can make a reasoned suggestion for better leadership along the lines you suggest.  <br/><br/>I expect that from the NYT on a matter of real importance such as this.

And there also will be pain for the well off in terms of using means testing for SS - and perhaps even Medicare.<br/><br/>At the end of the day we need about $4 trillion in cuts and revenues with about $600 billion in spending over 10 years as a down payment  on infrastructure improvements that will create jobs.<br/><br/>Everyone will get their pound of flesh but at least there will be some balance which is    far better than the plutocratic moves Romney would have made.<br/><br/>Scary to think how close we came to continuing the downward slide of the middle and working class that has been going on for 30 years.

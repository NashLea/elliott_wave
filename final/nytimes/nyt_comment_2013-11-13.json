The fact that in the Senate every state gets two seats, regardless of the state's population, and that in the House, Representatives represent relatively equal blocks of population, reflects a compromise made in the 1790s between more populous and less populous states.  It is part of the design of our governement, specifically to reduce the power of states with big populations, so that the smaller population states were willing to join the union.  <br/><br/>In addition, the fact that overall there were more votes for Democratic house candidates than Republican house candidates is irrelevant, if the Democratic votes are concentrated in more urban areas.  Note that this has almost nothing to do with gerrymandering; it has to do with the fact that urban areas tend to be more homogenous in their political party voting than less urban areas.  Winning a house seat with any more than 50.1% of the votes cast is a waste of votes, unfortunately for Democrats.  No Republicans are going to support proportional voting schemes for divying up house sets within each state, since it was never done like that in the past.

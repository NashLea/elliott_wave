The idea of working for one company and making your way \"up the ladder\"?  Laughable for people of that age group,  and for good reason,  \"up the ladder\" is actually a rare occurance nowadays.  The idea of having only one job?  Again quite foreign to the age group,  they work two,  three,  even several,  some related to their fields of study,  or career,  some not;  all basically part time.  Dedication?  Maybe if they work in a real small place;  but again the younger ones seem very aware that the large companies and huge multinationals will throw them to the wind if need be;  why go above and beyond,  it no longer leads to raises or promotions.  My friend's son works in a nightclub.  He has a degree and wants to work in his field;  but starting salaries are barely what he gets hourly at the nightclub.

(Otherwise one could say we have semantic nihilism.)<br/><br/>Martin@48:  Thank you for your response. My quibble is actually with the word \"unscientific\".  <br/><br/>In doing geophysical research there is little control over the data one can measure, and much too often hypotheses need to be framed or tested (and textbooks written) on the basis of extremely sparse data, verging on scientific impropriety in the eyes of some.  So, where does one really draw the boundary between \"scientific\" and \"unscientific\" in connection with the sparseness of the data?  <br/><br/>My attitude is that gathering such data -- no matter how sparse its collective state is at any given time -- is an ongoing process.  One hopes sufficient \"spot tests\" -- so to speak -- can be obtained to indicate how hypotheses should be supported or altered.  This by no means suggests that a spot test or other limited observation is \"unscientific\".  (Anyone who sees a connect with recent news about difficulties in research for treatment for cancer would not be far off the mark.)<br/><br/>In a real case in point about earthquake activity, a colleague told me that for a year or two after the huge San Francisco earthquake in 1906, the incidence of earthquake activity in that region was found significantly \"below normal\" -- as if earthquakes there took a \"quiet holiday\". He said that this same type of \"quiet period\" is now being observed in the region around the recent gigantic earthquake off the coast of Japan that caused the devastating tsunami.  I would be hard put to call these data and their inferences \"unscientific\".<br/><br/>As a means of collecting data (a.k.a. \"getting results\"), spot tests are a legitimate and well-sanctioned method.

However, I think you over-looked some \"unspoken assumption\" that seemed to be playing in the background. <br/><br/>And, that is, there is a sense, that, from here on out (at least for most of the industrialized western democratic countries) will be dealing with a diminish economical pie (both internally and between themselves).<br/><br/>Hence, the political sense is that no matter what we in the west do now, our days of being the top \"economical dogs\" are really behind us and furthermore since no one has yet articulated how we are going to beat this new coming power (namely china) on the economical competition front; then, that assumption is taking to be \"truth\" of our future.<br/><br/>Consequently, people begin to think it may not be a bad idea to hold on to what they got so far and let everyone else sink or swim which really getting to be the prevailing reality of most western countries.<br/><br/>And, that notion, as you will understand will make people fearful of the future, as well as making them fractious in-terms of looking each other suspiciously. And therefore, politics itself becomes (at least at the national level), at best, as that of managing ever-splintering factional in-fighting, like what Mr. Obama is trying to do with his budget negotiation. <br/><br/>Or at worst it will become a scene of sectional grandstanding, like the manner that horrible man by the name Mr. E. Cantor is trying to do with America's credit worthiness.<br/><br/>All in all; I really fear for the western political scene for the coming few years. Unless we miraculously run into a large GDP growth of 5% to 6% on a sustain basis for at least a decade like 1990s. <br/><br/>If, however, that later scenario is too fanciful then I fear we must \"borrow\" a chapter from Britain's post-war history particularly what they used to called it \"managing decline\" as best we could under the circumstances.", "recommendationCount": 92}, {"assetID": 2976453, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/opinion/sunday/17friedman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4169082, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Karen Garcia", "createDate": "1310858590", "userID": 48110597, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1310898580", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Paltz, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1310894980", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "It\u2019s quite a stretch to cast a whole generation born in the boom years as the culprits in a national fiscal scandal which we are selfishly willing to our progeny. This is buying into the David Brooks School of Thought, which  deflects blame onto generational conceits rather than where it really belongs:  the corrupt global cabal of bankers, corporations and the bought and paid for politicians everywhere.\r<br/><br/>But if you insist on playing the Boomer blame game, let\u2019s look at two powerful individuals from that era of selfish hedonism. First, President Bill Clinton:  born into the working class, a self-made man who left the country with a surplus when he left the presidency.  And then there was George Bush II, he of the proverbial silver spoon and foot in mouth, destroying every business venture he ever touched and almost single-handedly grinding this nation into a bottomless crater through tax cuts for millionaires and unpaid-for wars for the sole and exclusive benefit of the profiteers.\r<br/><br/>Eric Cantor was born so late in the Baby Boomer Era (1963),I think it\u2019s safe to label him only with the first word of that appellation. His self-selected high school yearbook quote was \u201cI want what I what when I want it.\u201d He is the very model of a modern major pain.\r<br/><br/>As for your Greco-American meme of nations gone bad, that\u2019s another false equivalence. The GOP spinners use Greece as a cautionary tale of what will happen here if we don\u2019t get our own fiscal house in order.  While the Greek government was inept and improvident in handling its own economy, a lot of the onus should be on the global banking system, which gladly loaned Greece a ton of money it can\u2019t repay.  The only similarity between us and them is that the \u201choi polloi\u201d are the only ones hurting. The banks aren't being forced to take the haircut, neither here nor there.\r<br/><br/>The kids aren\u2019t mad at the parents who gave them life.

The whole goal has only been to stabilize the economy and begin to drive growth again. But how exactly is growth defined? What kind of growth? What does it mean to have a strong economy?<br/><br/>We keep looking at the money as if shifting it around or printing more of it will somehow solve our problems. But money isn't the problem. It's what we want to do with it that's the problem. Can we set aside the idea that profit generation = healthy economy? Because the fact is that profit does not drive a healthy economy. It may have done so during previous generations, but the interconnected nature of our global society is making it impossible to use profit as the prime motivator for doing work. As we become more globally interdependent, the closed nature of our social system becomes clear. A closed system only functions if it is in balance. And you cannot draw excess from a closed system without damaging or severely unbalancing that system.<br/><br/>We need to focus on actually solving real problems for the benefit of everyone. If we only evaluate needs based on our ability to profit from them, then our problems will never actually get solved. They will only be serviced by people who can provide temporary relief in exchange for profit. In the mean time the problems we service will get bigger and harder to deal with until pain forces us to work for solutions instead of money, or some other kind of personal gain.<br/><br/>'Love your neighbor as yourself', is much more than just a pretty saying.

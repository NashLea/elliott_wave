Devyani must have followed the law of the land. She did not seem to have full diplomatic immunity at the time when she made false statements.

Minimum wages in India are so low, it traps the poor and lead to increase in poverty. Two thirds of the Indian population live on less than $2 per day. This is a national disgrace and the indian govt. is trying to defend it. India as a country cannot grow if the poor are not treated well.  The fact that the government officials do not understand this view is a sad state of affairs in India. Shame on us Indians for not voicing our opinions.  I don't care how Devyani was treated.

While you read this, you are no longer a republican, democrat or Tea Party supporter. Read this thread yourself with out any labels and with an open mind.<br/><br/>Most Americans right now are clueless about the current situation pending with our government shut down. It sickens me to see people on these boards and other like minded boards from America still talking about rubbish. Everyone is so engulfed in finding the next big conspiracy that they are missing that the train heading down the tracks is about to hit them. (I will explain later on)<br/><br/>I see a lot of wisdom on these boards and another site i frequent. People who are unique, wise and capable of much more than your standard Joe Shmoe. It sad to see a lot of it going to waste though. If you made it this far more than likely you are someone who is meant to read this thread. I'm betting your someone who knows they are capable of much more than most. Now is your time to act! Now is your time to give others that wisdom that may indeed save their lives.<br/><br/>Right now if you turn on any major news network you will see talk of the pending government shut down in the USA. Everyone is focusing on the talks taking place, budget cuts, extensions, planned parenthood cuts and etc.<br/><br/>For a minute, lets take a step back! Lets forget all the none sense. Ask your self \"what is really happening?\"<br/><br/>- The US Dollar loosing value [link to <a href=\"http://www.torfx.com\" title=\"www.torfx.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.torfx.com</a>]<br/><br/>- Military Pay currently 1/2 (If you know anyone ask them to check their LES)<br/><br/>- We are fighting 3 wars (do i really need to link)<br/><br/>- Our \"Government is out of money\" google it<br/><br/>- Iran, China, Turkey and Russia are allies now.

(noticed how i reversed them from earlier? :o) )<br/>\nDoes funding another day of the USA government matter?<br/><br/>When you hear the word Government as an American you think of a system that is set in stone. Something no Americans (excluding Katrina victims and 911 victims) have lived with out from birth. Are you so sure this government is real though? Has this government protected you as a citizen? Has this government served you as an American?<br/><br/>My point is, stop waiting. Stop watching the news. Stop being distracted! It's already over! Even if the Government comes up with a solution to remain running, it is over!<br/><br/>The only thing left now is you. Your decisions, your principals and morals. What will you do? Will you keep buying into a broken system that is 14 Trillon dollars in debt? Will you watch Tv tonight go out and drink and abuse your freedoms even further? It is time for you to think for yourself and realize we are back to square one. We are right back to the time and same reasons/ evils that our founding fathers fought and drafted our constitution to escape.<br/><br/>Where is your faith in a god? Or humanity? Peace or Love? If you do not believe in God that you can't see or hear why continue to believe in a system you can see and hear failing? It's spelled out clearly.<br/><br/>Think for your self. Do not let them think for you!<br/><br/>Your world as you know it has ended my fellow Americans. While tomorrow it may drag on another day week or years, it is here. Face it. Do something about it. Prepare!<br/><br/>Do not be the one stuck saying why is this happening and expecting someone to help you. In the moment you reach that point, it is already to late. It will be every man for himself.<br/><br/>For those of you have read this in it's entirety. Thank You. Perhaps it is time we group together combine our wisdom and figure out what to do? If you are not American please do not be mad at us, ask how you can help.

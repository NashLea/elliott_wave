Counselling for folks might have helped too.<br/><br/>Since that time, the research on meat and other high fat foods has substantiated the low fast claims. True, there may be a modest amount of eggs or fish that one could eat with no impact but the overall message of the research is very clear:  foods high in fat and cholesterol lead to cardiovascular disease.  <br/><br/>As Dr. Esselstyn writes, the China study substantiates this.

You must realize that while we do not currently have an insurmountable medium-term deficit problem, there is a future crisis looming if nothing is done to address the entitlement drain.  This discussion is anathema to most politicians, but certainly more so to Democrats.  Mr. Obama's budget was already set to lower discretionary spending to the lowest level in 50 years, in the absence of the sequester.  I assume this was done in order to preserve entitlements at the status quo, but tell me, is that a smart plan for our nation's future?  We continue to underinvest in infrastructure, education, and growth-oriented policies to maintain unsustainable levels of entitlement.  We are depriving our children of a strong, innovative economy, and a world-class infrastructure and educational system in the name of preserving programs intended to be \"insurance against need,\" not guarantees of a comfortable retirement.<br/><br/>So, please, Mr. Krugman, stop being the guy who sits behind home plate and razzes the opposing team.  Use your profound intellect to offer, discuss, and disseminate ideas for solving that problem in a way which is comprehensive, fair, and compassionate.  That is the problem we need to address now, because, as I read long ago in one of my Econ 101 texts, \"in the long run, we're all dead.\" ", "recommendationCount": 4}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Those mistakes still haunt us, but he understood the character of his time and the menace of nuclear war (at least, he seemed to have grasped that menace). President Kennedy was an illusion in some ways, but, in an odd way, one who sometimes acted wisely.<br /><br />President Nixon let his deputies institute some excellent domestic policies, while he blew much in the realm of foreign policy, though, even there, he had his moments. President Ford did not get to act freely. His great mistake was letting Mr. Nixon off the hook but that was, perhaps, a humane act.  President Carter was not up to the job. Intelligence did not make him an effective president.<br /><br /> President Reagan undermined government. He was as an awful president\u2014much overrated. President George H. W. Bush seemed almost competent, except that he lost control of the deficit. President Clinton was a closet conservative. He did reduce spending and reversed the deficit. The way the Supreme Court elected George W. Bush undermined constitutional government. The current president seems clueless. What is wrong with him? He seemed full of promise.  He had majorities in both houses of the Congress. He had a mandate for change. He blew it.<br /><br />Where are the leaders? Where are people like Richard Lugar when we need him? The Republicans collapsed into the brain dead demagoguery of Dr. Gingrich. The Democrats collapsed into the empty campaign gloss of Professor Obama.

I have closely studied the Gardner piet\u00e0 drawing but have not seen the Kober painting. I would never dare, based on images on a Web site, speculate whether this is in Michelangelo's hand. But I would like to address things raised by other commenters as well as raise points on my own. First, M. did many \"presentation drawings\" for Vittoria Colonna, whom he loved dearly as a friend. These are not \"sketches\" as some have said, but finished works of art he presented to her. That is a world of difference. There are several sublime presentation drawings that M did for Vittoria --all on religious themes- in the Queen's private collection at Windsor Castle. The Gardner drawing, akin to those at Windsor, shows his values and skills from about 1532 (when he was 57) to about 1555 (when he was 80). His style certainly evolved, became in some ways more essential and austere. A \"translation\" into paint, whether done by M, by a contemporary, or later on, would perforce be different because it is a different medium. So to would sculpture, for all the obvious reasons. Then, this is hardly the first Michelangelo to be \"discovered\" in modern times. There was a painting found, I believe, in Scotland that was restored at the Met museum and then the Met allowed itself to be outbid by the Kimbell Museum in Ft. Worth--final price about $76 million, I think. A real failure on the Met's part when it had spent more on paintings of less value or heritage. Allan in Torino mentioned a wood cross \"found\" in Italy. There were actually two. The most recent is of uncertain authorship but the one before (in Florence) was not.    Some commenters said the Kober is crudely painted. I invite you to look at the Manchester Madonna and the Deposition, both paintings by M at London's National Gallery. Both are glorious but one could also find a crudeness to them. Michelangelo was Mannerist and some of his painting is closer in style to El Greco (who met M in Rome) than to gorgeous figures by Bellini, Botticelli or other artists slightly older than M. I enjoyed the spirit of the words of commenter #25. And I was engaged by the commenter who wrote that Michelangelo never set his paintings at night. I would have to think further on that. Certainly there is darkness is some of the scenes of The Last Judgment on the wall (not ceiling) of the Sistine Chapel, which dates to about 1545.   There is a painting he did of Leda and the Swan for the Duke of Ferrara which is now thought to be lost (it belonged to Francis I of France but went missing). It is in closeup detail --according to the copies made by other artists at the time-- with a dark background that does not connote daylight. Then there is the Medici Chapel in Florence, where the sculptures evoke Night and Day, Dawn and Dusk. Like Beethoven, Shakespeare, Mozart and just a few other creators, Michelangelo is larger, more complex and universal than any one of us can describe. So we look at him in pieces, closely and repeatedly if we are fortunate to do so, and accept that the questions are at least as thrilling as the answers.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 2789829, "replies": [], "lft": 134, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/economy/30auto.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3910724, "rgt": 135, "userDisplayName": "Mouse Woman of the Northwest Coast", "createDate": "1306728485", "userID": 56261035, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1306728604", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Washington State", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1306725004", "commentSequence": 39, "commentBody": "That's nice, but I already have a car.

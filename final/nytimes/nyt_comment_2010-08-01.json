I, and I venture to assume many others, are neither according to the accepted definitions. I find abortion abhorrent. I also recognize that it has existed from the beginning of time and will always exist. Extremists who think that holding signs and screaming outside of facilities that provide abortions are on a fool's errand. How many of the saved babies will they commit to care for?  Furthermore, most of those extremists have no interest or compassion for women who find themselves in the position to have to consider aborting a baby. While a very few women do so casually, for most it is a wrenching decision. I have never forgotten the woman who was deserted by her husband and left to care for two children on her own with very limited resources. She was ecstatic when he returned and wanted to reconcile. During the brief time of reconciliation she became pregnant. He then deserted her again. She could find no way that she could have another baby with along the attendant challenges of caring for a  newborn,  still care for her two children financially and emotionally and possibly losing her job. Sadly, she chose abortion. She saw no other option.<br /><br />Would it have been better if this woman, and so many others, had to resort to dangerous, untrained abortionists? Would it have been better if she had died during an illegal abortion and left her two children alone? These are the questions that so called \"pro-life\" people have to answer. These are the undesirable choices we have to make. Obviously, the best approach is to prevent those pregnancies to begin with. Yet some  \"pro-life\" individuals are also against contraception. That includes the Catholic Church (of which I was a member from birth) and makes no sense.<br /><br />Can we possibly come together with the understanding that unplanned, unwanted pregnancy  can be a horrible burden on women and living children? Can we do everything in our power to prevent women, where ever they live, from being in that position where abortion becomes a choice they have to make? Can we end the political fight and come together to a position  where we reverence  life from its beginning but understand that, in the real world, women will choose to end pregnancies even at the risk of their own lives?

Today Australia is one of the most vocal and active anti-whaling nations on the planet. Why is this so? Because, Australians woke up to the reality that cetaceans are complex, social, highly intelligent beings, and that killing them was simply wrong.<br /><br />Research continues to show that cetaceans are capable of a level of self-awareness and learned cultural behaviour that puts them on a par with ourselves, to an extent where killing them should be abhorrent to all but the most callous and greed-driven individual.<br /><br />Today the Faroese enjoy a standard of living higher than most other developed nations, including the USA, so arguing that the practice is necessary for food is disingenuous.

(though I wish they did). If they did then the meat these creatures provided would remain local, feeding the local population, not getting shipped all over the world to upscale restaurants and or as remedies for absurd medical issues.<br /><br />And they do remain local!! It\u00b4s strictly prohibited by law to export whale-meat from the Faroes, but not that I would expect anything else but ignorance on your behalf on that matter. They are also ONLY feeding the local people by old traditions that anybody from the community showing up when the whales are being divided can stake a claim regardless if they actually participated or not. This to secure elder and/or people that for any reason are unable to participate a fair part. Everything on the whale is consumed. In later years some meat has been available for sale (still prohibited for export) to secure faroese of other areas of the country to be able to buy it. It varies a lot where around these islands the whales will be found.<br /><br />And there is no such thing as \u201clocal waters\u201d anymore. We\u2019re a global world now. The C02 in China eventually reaches us just like the C02 we produce ultimately reaches them.<br /><br />And unfortunately both the CO2 that you and China produce eventually reaches the Faroe Islands (eventually is of course an understatement since it already  has reached us ages ago!!). Sadly the reversed thing can\u00b4t be said since our contribution is so minor that it blows away like a fart in the wind.<br /><br /> We all know the waters in which these mammals swim ultimately evaporates, goes up into the atmosphere to create clouds, and those clouds make rain that falls everywhere. So this isn\u2019t about \u201ctheir rights\u201d to do whatever they want in their \u201clocal waters\u201d anymore. Their waters are a part of our global commons. What they do effects the entire global ecosystem.<br /><br />Are you for real??? what the population of the Faroe Islands (approx.48000 people) do in whale-hunting affect the entire global ecosystem. You should be ashamed of yourself, probably driving off in your Chevy V8 (just using some generalizing ignorance like yourself) as a typical american car housing a 5-7 liters engine, which is more or less the same as 7 of those engines (0.9 liters) in an european eco-car. And that CO2 wont reach the clouds and drip on my face face in the Faroes<br />?<br /><br />these cars are popular in the Faroes among other european countries, and did you know why? because we have to pay green taxes, gas taxes and this-and-that taxes to prevent us from driving anything else. At the same time your government has stretched it\u00b4s brain to commiting to a strategy to see american cars doing at least 15 km/l in 15 years from now. WHAT A JOKE!!! thats what a middle-class-car did in europe some 10 years ago!!!!<br /><br />...These authors imagine what earth must have been like before man stepped foot on this planet; a palpable sorrow beats between their lines of prose. Well I mourn for these dolphins and whales with an equally palpable sorrow.<br /><br />NO YOU DONT!! You just say that you do, but you really dont! However if you where sincere you go to  the recycling-scrapyard first thing tomorrow and get rid of your ridicilous Chevy and buy a bicycle instead or an european eco-car.

And it must have been one in which they swam free from the endless torment of our ruthless species.<br /><br />Elizabeth Tjader<br /><br />I can assure you that swimming in Faroese waters still would be the preferred location for any pilot-whale any day of the week, and the closest they will ever get to long, long ago (although i\u00b4m not sure for how long we\u00b4ll be able to keep you polluting people off our back).

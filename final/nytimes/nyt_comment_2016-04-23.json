To that, add the relentless propaganda barrage that keeps telling us that there is basically no such thing as a stable career and that we'll all have to spend our lives competing and conforming to avoid ending up starving amongst the homeless. Frankly, the current situation in America is making George Orwell look like an OPTIMIST. It's also an insane recipe for social discord. At least in the Euro Zone, where wage-hours laws eliminate the 'exempt' loophole and such matters as social media and even your charge card purchases are off-limits to employers, they still hire mere human beings and don't let their unemployed citizens starve in the streets.

They would be in a fog, not really living life, just waiting for the end to come. I'd rather live my life as healthy and addiction-free as I can, and if the pain ever becomes too much, I think I'd probably end it.

An adict will make dozens or hundreds of drug purchases a year and even casual users make many. The average gun fancier makes only a handful in a lifetime.<br/><br/>Second, guns are not addictive or even habuitating in anything like the way drugs are. This means the average gun buyer is probably far more price sesitive than the average drug buyer. If prohibition made guns, say, 3 times as expensive, I'd bet the number of purchases would drop by something like 80%."}]}, "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/in-public-conversation-on-guns-a-rhetorical-shift/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7859526, "rgt": 37, "userDisplayName": "Vanessa Hall", "createDate": "1355548193", "userID": 5310634, "replyCount": 11, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1355548217", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Millersburg, Missouri", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1355548217", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "What would happen if we had a war on illegal weapons and illegal possession of weapons instead of a war on drugs?", "recommendationCount": 171}, {"assetID": 3351911, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/righteous-babe-in-the-hall-bilskirnir/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7859525, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "Rijkstra", "createDate": "1355548192", "userID": 39601591, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1355548218", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Arizona", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1355548218", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "This turned out to be an easy Saturday for me.

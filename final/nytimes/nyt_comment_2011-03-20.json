Mack's foul with 1.4 secs actually impacted the possibility of a shot at the basket for Pitt, however unlikely that he would score. The very aggressive foul knocked Brown out of bounds. The final foul by Robinson had no possible impact on the game other than to allow the referee to move Butler 80 feet closer to the basket. What's equally disturbing is the way Mack trash-talked at Brown, standing in front of him on the foul line, while the oblivious refs both watched replays to determine how to reset the time clock. You expect that gamesmanship in the NBA, not in college tournament play. In the former it could be a technical foul. In NCAA it most certainly is.

If we had struck just 24 hours earlier, we could have hit the tanks on their way to Benghazi and kept Qaddafi's forces out of that city.

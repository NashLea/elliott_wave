Yes, you have the NYT behind you, which surely must give even this \"walking human IED\" pause. Of course, I jope I'm wrong about any danger to you -- maybe this jerk immediately smelled the coffee, at least in your case.<br /><br />The failures on the parts of eBay and Citibank are absolutely appalling. As for law enforcement, we have to remember two factors that restrict them: (1.) for criminal charges, a police have to build a case at least minimally acceptable to the prosecutor's office, given tight budget all around, even in the best of economic times; and, (2.)the burden of proof, perhaps unfortunately, is the responsibility of the accuser, in this case, ultimately, Ms. Rodriguez (via convincing the police, etc.).<br /><br />Several here have expressed the sentiment (with which I agree) that it sure would be nice to strip him of his U.S. citizenship and deport him back to Russia. While I'm not a lawyer, as I understand it, if a person has obtained his citizenship legally and didn't obtain it using false pretenses, I don't think he *can* be so treated. If you have a passport, read the bit in it about giving up or losing your citizenship -- it's rare. Ditto (I think) if he has some other kind of visa or a green card. His despicable behavior reported here does not involve his immigration status. (Just think of all the ruckus about illegal aliens along our southern border; many people seem not to realize that \"illegal entry\" doesn't equate to *criminal* entry -- it's a *civil* offense. Maybe it SHOULD be criminal, but it's not, for now anyway.)<br /><br />Though I can't actually condone any criminal in itself retaliation against this thug, I wouldn't exactly lose any sleep were I to read here in the NYT later that this guy messed with the wrong person -- a powerful politician or businessperson, maybe. Or maybe the NYPD's Chief's wife! Or a mafia don's. El Jerko is likely too smart for that, though; I doubt he'd ever try to run a scam on the First Lady, for instance.<br /><br />Again -- what a tremendous piece of work.

The truly dishonest merchants  are not interested in the concept of 'customer satisfaction' which is probably a Western or even American conceit.  A Chinese manufacturer substitutes melamine into milk to add bulk and it's about his profit, not about anything else.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on the internet which is a blank slate, there is no way to identify the cultural proclivities of the seller.  You must rely on the inherent  honesty of the system and take whatever safeguards are afforded to you.  I have bought from ebay quite a few times and from amazon more than a few times and my experiences have been uniformly satisfactory.  It is really up to those hosting the seller to insure they are honest and it's up to the buyer to be proactive and search for criticism of the seller and then make an informed decision.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2123153, "replies": [], "lft": 104, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/business/media/29carr.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2905022, "rgt": 105, "userDisplayName": "Eugene Victor", "createDate": "1291004356", "userID": 42852462, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1291008583", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Brooklyn", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1291035796", "commentSequence": 44, "commentBody": "Just because there weren't massive protests at airports does not mean that people are pleased with the new screening measures, nor that people believe that a good balance has been struck between security and individual rights.

Overt protests would almost certainly get one removed for questioning... which could involve missing one's flight, and missing Thanksgiving dinner with family. I doubt many fliers are willing to make such a sacrifice, even if they are displeased with TSA procedures.

Unfortunately, the change is coming much too slow but that\u2019s no reason to stop fighting for what\u2019s right. Every time a victim speaks up, another victim knows that he or she is not alone. Blaming the victims and covering up for perpetrators will stop (hopefully soon) since more people every day are saying that this in unacceptable. Victim blaming and shaming goes on all the time in third world countries \u2013 even to the point of so-called honor killings for rape victims but in this country victims of sex crimes should get the same dignified hearing and the same chance of justice as victims of any other crime.

A.P. and G.G. seem to assume that an \"atheist\" is dedicated to the proposition that there is no \"God\" (whatever that means).  In fact, some are, but many others are simply judging on the evidence and if there were to be good evidence for a \"God\" they would be willing to consider it.<br/><br/>I can't resist picking the gaping hole in one more of A.P.'s arguments.  Yes, this could be the best of all possible worlds, as he proposes without evidence.  It could equally well be the worst of all possible worlds.  In that case, \"God\" would surely exist, due to the otherwise low probability of the worst being the real world, and would plainly be the \"Devil\".  Does that inspire A.P.'s belief in the Devil?

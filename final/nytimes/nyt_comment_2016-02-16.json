A good philosopher should by now know that \"out of the crooked timber of humanity nothing straight was ever made.\" It's not hopelessness I'm arguing for but a cruel truth about knowing the future and the core principle of induction in science:  Sustained past performance is indeed an indication of future outcomes.

Just because we\u2019ve played with the scientific method in the last 500 years doesn\u2019t assure me that we won\u2019t regress to what we were in the first 199,500 years of our existence.

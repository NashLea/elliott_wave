Now for those who don't their in the job for the money. We hear even those nominated feeling like winners. Even Senator Sessions is jealous because he was never nominated by any Republican President. How sad he must of felt when Bush nominated his best friend Harriet Mieers who never saw a court room, never wrote a brief and only worked in a Law office. Poor Harriet couldn't even answer legal questions but still Bush didn't want Sessions in the job.  Justice Roberts were groomed for the Supreme Court from the beginning of his career in Law. He worked for Reagan and make the biggest mistakes that even an actor like Reagan wouldn't take his advice. When the time came Roberts got married/adopted children to look the right way and then got the job. Now Roberts didn't let that fake family style stop him from vacationing with his girlfriend of color. He got caught when he had the heart attack and was seen on his boat after his return from the hospital. The Justices have their own secrets and some well it's the way they talk/walk that give it away. Elena is more qualified as a Justice then both Alito and Roberts.  What's sad is Alito is still sending out thank you notes to his rich inside supporters who advised Bush who to choose. Who knows maybe Obama will at lease nominate Senator Sessions because he clearly isn't qualified and will never be a Justice or a Judge.

All I felt was immense relief when I drew a high enough draft number in 1972. When Nixon ended the draft the following winter (or maybe the winter after), it was announced over the Hope College dining hall p.a. system, to wild applause. What exactly did we accomplish in  Vietnam? I feel no more guilt at not having fought or died there than I do not being one of the thousands of Americans who perish in automobile accidents every year. The other point, often overlooked, is that America had far too many young men of fighting age during the Vietnam War for all to have served in the Army. Selective  Service, for all its faults, was a system for dealing with that oversupply of cannon fodder. College deferments came about because  General Lewis Hershey, director of Selective Service, did not want the U.S. to lose large numbers of its smartest and best-educated young men, as  Britain did in World War I.

They are willingly cutting themselves off from any contradictory and opposing views, as if they may come from some kind of antichrist. They do hate government, because they were made to believe government is evil. They do reject science as if it was propaganda arm of the government.<br /><br />This is not comedy on TV folks, this is our reality.

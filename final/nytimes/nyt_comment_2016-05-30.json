She may not be charismatic, but she is someone that Chinese voters in Taiwan trust because she has established a reputation for probity and consensus-based policy making that differs from the corruption and cronyism that marred the reputations of Taiwan's first DPP president, Chen Shuibian and others of his generation (and certainly is a problem for Xi Jinping and his cohorts).

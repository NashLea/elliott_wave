Each district has ~12-13 finalists and selects two as Rhodes Scholars, on the spot, on Saturday night, after this second round (and more deliberation).<br/><br/> It's not a process that can be bypassed or individually adjourned and, as the NYT suggests, it's one whose schedule is clearly stated from the outset. While it's not my place to judge whether or not Witt made the 'right' choice, I do think, given the nature of the process, that the \"heat\" the Rhodes Trust has taken is unjustified.<br/><br/>Moreover, let's not forget about the real tragedy that occurred that day. It's not a). that Yale lost;  b). that Witt forewent a shot at a 2012 Rhodes Scholarship;  nor c). that Williams (it seems) lied.

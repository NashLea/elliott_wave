Operation Ceasefire needs to be implemented fully in Oakland, and the overpaid cops and firefighters need to take a 10% pay cut. I recognize these are incredibly hard jobs but police and fire are 2/3 of the city's budget, and police get paid the highest starting salary in California. With this extra money the city can divide it in half: half to new police officers, and half to social services to combat Oakland's crime rate. These programs could include job programs that lower recidivism rates, increasing library hours, and cleaning up parks. Also Oakland needs to accept that economic growth is GOOD for the city, and that gentrification has its perks. Also Oakland needs some decent leadership, and that includes getting a new mayor after Quan's term is up. Oakland needs a strong leader at the top who deeply cares about the city like Quan, but doesn't have the flip-floppiness of Mitt Romney. Also Oakland needs the Occupy Movement to work with the city and its residents. Otherwise, Occupy Oakland will be known as a group of mostly-out-of-towners commited to wrecking Oakland and everything that good in it. Finally, Oakland is a great city and that is why almost 400,000 people call it home.

Our culture, and economic and legal traditions, are mostly rooted in Britain, including basic rights like trial by jury, a privilege that never existed in much of Continental Europe. Our capitalist system, so basic to our identity and way of life, grew out of classical economics developed in Britain, with which France has never been entirely comfortable, remaining an agrarian society long after the Industrial Revolution transformed Britain and America, and never even developed a modern banking system until well into the 19th century.<br/>\nFrance is a friendly nation with many attributes, but its role in the development of America should not be overstated.

Secrecy has returned as a tactical strength in operational policy. It  helped established BP $20 billion escrow. It has lowered the rhetoric of international hosility. It enabled drone atttacks to be successful and its best example is  the termination of bin Laden, achieved not only without a leak, but with feints and actions that utterly concealed a mission unfolding in full force.<br/><br/>To counter these successes, successes in which secrecy worked the way it should, to enhance national security (althrough the death of bin Laden without due process remains worrisome for many), Republicans have raised a frontal attack to obscure and question this success. Call it swift boating secrecy. <br/><br/>But empirically, on the ground, little will change. Breaching secrets has important uses (many cited here!), as many as secrecy does.

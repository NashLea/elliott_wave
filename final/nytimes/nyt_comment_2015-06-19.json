I started watching NBA at the tail-end of Magic/Bird era, so for me the gold-standard is Michael Jordan.  As a Knicks and Nets fan I didn't like MJ, but he was the greatest of his era, and I couldn't help admiring his game and character.  Lebron is an awesome talent and maybe the best player ever, but when he declares he is the best player, or he puts on an espn show to declare his playing intentions, he shows a fragility of ego, self-absorption, desire for celebrity, mental weakness...not sure exactly what, that MJ would never show.  Lebron reminds me more of Shaq than Jordan, which is fine because Shaq was awesome and he seemed to enjoy playing and celebrity.  MJ on the other hand, valued winning over all those other things, and he trusted his team (over time) and elevated everyone.  Lebron doesn't have Pippen equivalent, but Mozgov, Shumpert, Smith, and Thomas vs Longley, Grant, Paxson, Armstrong, Harper might favor Cleveland.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3431746, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 15267352, "replies": [], "commentID": 15268178, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Magnus", "createDate": "1434693353", "userID": 72251484, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1434718592", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Den", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Hawaii", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1434714992", "commentSequence": 15268178, "commentBody": "I agree with LeBron's self assessment: He is the best B'baller in the world.

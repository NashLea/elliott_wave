Keiser's startlingly prescient report was not seen by many Americans because it was broadcast on Al Jazeera, but it can be viewed on YoutTube at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/44jmqq\" title=\"http://tinyurl.com/44jmqq\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/44jmqq</a>.<br/>\nViewers will find Keiser's long interview with none other than Asgeir Jonasson, the shell-shocked bank research director who tells Mr. Halpern that \"I was psychologically unable to admit that we were doomed.\" Keiser's video interview shows him in full-blown denial. After discussing the enormous risks that the bank and its depositors were taking, Keiser asked why the bank continued to add still more risk. Asgeir didn't see the point. Keiser, exasperated, drew the banker's attention to the fearsome Mt. Hekla, Iceland's most dangerous volcano, and asked him whether the fact that it exploded only occasionally would provide enough reassurance to him to approve a mortgage for an expensive vacation home to be built on its slope. Of course not, he replied - no one should build there. The point of the analogy went right by him.<br/><br/>The indebtedness of the next generation is due in part to the heady mixture of pseudo-libertarian ideology, deregulation, and corruption (hitherto rare in Iceland) that is strikingly reminiscent of our own experience.

If a cop leaves the force, his pending cases likely fail. If they lose track of witnesses over the years, the case will fail. A private attorney will put serious energy into knowing more about the witnesses than the prosecutor, so he knows when they no longer can produce the witnesses to make their case -- married, got a new job, moved, even just died.

The airline industry learned that without carefully examining mistakes or near misses in which accidents were narrowly averted, they could not learn what they needed to learn in order to prevent accidents.  Pilots were not willing to report near misses for fear of being disciplined or even losing their jobs.  Once the airlines took a non punitive approach, pilots began reporting near misses and safety improved.  Medicine adopted what is called \"just culture\" recognizing that most mistakes were not due to incompetence or individual malfeasance, but instead resulted from faulty processes.  But, quality review in medicine is not done in public and in fact findings are protected from discovery by plaintiff's attorneys in many states.  Contrast that with what happens in police cases, where for the most part officers are tried in the streets or in the press before investigation even starts. The challenge is to distinguish legitimate mistakes from reckless behavior and outright criminality be it by pilots, medical professionals or police.  That requires a thorough, timely and unbiased review, away from the public eye until complete, done in an atmosphere protected from politics and the emotions of victims.

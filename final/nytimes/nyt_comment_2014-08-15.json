You have the fed raise the interest rate for a year or two.  That can cause a sharp recession, but as soon as inflation is controlled and rates are lowered again, things bounce back.  (This is basically the story of \"Morning in America\", the growth boom that followed Volcker's arrest of the '70s inflation problems.)  And given that we all know the history, it's quite plausible that an inflation-arresting reset of expectations would be less damaging now than it was in the early '80s.<br/><br/>In any case, crushing the economy under obviously inadequate demand in order to avoid the hypothetical specter of too much demand is kind of insane.  It's like saying, \"If I give this man with sepsis penicillin, I might over-dose him, and then he'd die of penicillin poisoning!  So I must sit on my hands and let the infection continue to spread.\"  Or, even worse, \"I must give him only minimal / inadequate doses that will allow the infection to develop antibiotic resistance.\"  The equivalent of Japan's start/stop response to its deflation crisis, or the stimulus we had in the US, which was less than half of what experts recommended -- it helped a little, temporarily, but because it didn't fully solve the problem, further action faces steeper political hurdles."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 12563215, "replies": [], "commentID": 12564197, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Abin Sur", "createDate": "1408100330", "userID": 54470415, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1408105086", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Abin Sur", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Ungara", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1408101486", "commentSequence": 12564197, "commentBody": "Easy?

Yes, we are in an extended period of slow growth, but if the economy picks up, for some unforeseen reason, a technological breakthrough, a sea of oil in the Nevada desert, or even better, a settlement of the Arab-Israeli crisis, and we are close to full employment, the need for labor can grow and grow quickly. Prices will rise, wages will rise and they will spiral. I understand the malaise in which we now find ourselves, the disappointment of many because opportunity is limited, but if we enter the boom/bust cycle again the effects would be far more destructive. Just like a crash in the market, it takes a generation until investors forget the real danger, and the same applies to inflation. My opinion, based purely on intuition, not data, is simply that in economics, small increments of growth is the desired outcome; less is more. My formula for prosperity is too avoid war, update our infrastructure, relieve student debt, and provide a free college education to all. Throwing money at the problem is not the answer.

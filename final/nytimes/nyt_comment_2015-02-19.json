Let that child grow for 13 years without a public education, or (potentially worse) in a system which consistently treats him/her as an outcast under the constant threat of expulsion or worse (deportation). Obviously a child growing up in that system is significantly less likely to contribute positively to the economy (in terms of income tax, property tax, social security tax, et cetera). However, the true danger is that such a child is, according to the numerous studies I mentioned earlier, exceedingly likely to become involved in crime.  <br/><br/>That crime invokes a physical cost against it's victim, a social cost against the society who has lost that criminal's potential contributions to society, and a fiscal cost against the state budge which pays for the public schools that could have prevented this deadly combination.

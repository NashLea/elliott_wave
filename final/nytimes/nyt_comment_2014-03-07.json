NATO fought a brief war to protect the majority Albanians there (the Russians said \"occupy\" and \"interfere in the internal affairs\"). Then, while still under Western protections, the people of Kosovo had a referendum in which they decided to be independent of Serbia - an independence that was immediately recognized by most Western governments. Serbia and Russia strenuously protested that this was not only against the Serbian constitution, and against international norms, but also that Kosovo had always been a historical part of Serbia, and in fact part of the Serbian ancient heartland, which had only become majority Albanian relatively recently. In other words, the West was interfering in the \"territorial integrity\" of Serbia.<br/><br/>By comparison, the current Russian occupation (or \"protection\", as the Russians put it) of Crimea and its majority Russian population is relatively non-violent so far. Also, Crimea was not historically part of Ukraine.

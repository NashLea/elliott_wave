There is no wage pressure because when earnings come under pressure, business enterprises simply globally race to the bottom.  <br/><br/>I agree that we are not closing the gap between actual &amp; potential output.  Incredibly, the concept of \"the new norm\" has surfaced to see if it will stick.  This is completely nuts.

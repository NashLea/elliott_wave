The fact that BP could come up with this \"solution\" simply begs the question.  Where has the oil industry been for over 20 years?  This was the most obvious danger in deep water drilling, and somehow they never put the money into the research until AFTER the worst had happened?  This recklessness not only supports reparation, it also suggests that anybody involved in the sham that licensed them to start this drilling should be barred from any business in US waters.<br /><br />2.  What is this reflexive invective about Obama?  I don't hear any of those folks blaming Reagan for the Exxon Valdez or for its cleanup.  Instead, they whine about Katrina, conveniently forgetting that American citizens died and suffered there because there was no water, no food, no medicine, and no rescue -- the Coast Guard pilots who bravely went in immediately to rescue people were ordered back.<br /><br />Useless.

Instead of greater equality between men and women, and between girls and boys, we instead have girls \"becoming\" boys, which ultimately doesn't challenge gender discrimination in Afghanistan AT ALL. I really can't see how we, in the U.S., expect Afghanistan to become a self-supporting democracy when Afghanis, by and large, won't even recognize that a person with a penis and a person without a penis are equal.<br /><br />You can't change people who don't want to change. Add the extreme geography, widespread illiteracy, continued presence of the Taliban and various other terrorist groups, etc. etc. and you have a recipe for one thing and one thing only: a country of absolutely nothing at all.", "recommendationCount": 56}, {"assetID": 1871841, "replies": [], "lft": 104, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/world/asia/21gender.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2568153, "rgt": 105, "userDisplayName": "barbara", "createDate": "1285040396", "userID": 57822353, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1285044681", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "nyc", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1285070268", "commentSequence": 16, "commentBody": "Women are half the world's population yet they are a cultural underclass.  We are certainly smart enough and strong enough to do so many things and yet we remain deprived of equal rights and often subject to harsh rules that leave us physically and financially dependant on males that think only to their own power and control and use us as sex objects and breeders.<br /><br />Males determine the sex of a child and punish women for bearing girls.  A woman's sexual life is subject to a male interpretation.  An object of desire, she will be punished for his difficulties.  Women are sold in marriage as objects.  We live in the 21st century and the outrage for such behavior remains mild at best.<br />Afghanistan also sells it' poor children into sexual slavery.

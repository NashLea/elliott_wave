Economic cost is one goal of terrorism, as we know.<br/><br/>Second, while the bravery of the people who protect us is without dispute, the posting of the photos of those two men and the fact that a homeowner noticed a suspicious blood smear and tear on his boat cover is testament to the power of communication and the vigilance of everyday citizens.  Actions such as closing selected airspace over Boston is, from my distance, an emotional, not a measured, response.  <br/><br/>Finally, the signal that this operation sends to other actual or would-be terrorists  (domestic or foreign) is that with simple pressure cookers, nails, hydrogen peroxide, etc., their violence will be amplified many times over -- sufficient to shut down a major city for a day and command unending media coverage.

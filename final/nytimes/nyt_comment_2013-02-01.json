Iceland told the banks to get lost. Iceland bent over backwards to save the banks, including asking for insane loans to pay off their debts.<br/>\n2. Iceland nationalized the banks.<br/>\nIceland overtook the banks using emergency legislation and then privatized them again 15 months later, handing control to the receivers managing the old banks who in turn are managing them for the creditors. Two out of the three collapsed major banks in Iceland are owned by the creditors. (\u201cBut I thought Iceland shafted the creditors?\u201d Hahaha!) Some of the bankrupt banks only remained in government control for a few weeks.Not only did Iceland re-privatize the banking system, we sold it out of the country. We don't even know who owns the banks!<br/><br/>3. Iceland &amp; debt relief<br/>\nThere has been plenty of debt relief in Iceland. The the top 1% has had almost all of their debt written off. So nice of the banks. For the Icelandic public, the picture is a lot different. (Plus, their debt is index-linked, which equals debt-slavery).<br/><br/>4. Iceland is now growing very strongly<br/>\nIceland is surviving. Inflation for 2012 is ca 4%, for 2011 it was 5%.<br/>\nGrowth is estimated to be 2.7% in 2012 and was 2.6% in 2011. Most of the growth comes from a growing real estate and property bubble in Iceland.<br/>\nRead the Special Report <a href=\"http://sic.althingi.is/\" title=\"http://sic.althingi.is/\" target=\"_blank\">http://sic.althingi.is/</a>", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 3357522, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/mets-sign-reliever-latroy-hawkins/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8198559, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Stu Freeman", "createDate": "1359695548", "userID": 35591703, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1359695596", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Brooklyn, N.Y.", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1359695596", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "I thought the Yankees had signed all the baby boomers.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3357611, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 8198560, "replies": [], "commentID": 8201258, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "coale johnson", "createDate": "1359729645", "userID": 59172341, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1359733975", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 5, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Janet Ellingson", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "horseshoe meadow road, CA", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1359733975", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "republicans like mccain and graham have to oppose hagel...... any other position would be a tacit admission of their extreme lapse in judgement regarding the iraq war."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 8198560, "replies": [], "commentID": 8201299, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Petey Tonei", "createDate": "1359729896", "userID": 874543, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1359733975", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 9, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Janet Ellingson", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Massachusetts", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1359733975", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "Mr McCain and Mr Graham displayed their mean, nasty streak, but what about the invisible Mr Lieberman, the missing trio, surely he was pulling strings from behind?

They talked about their innovative curriculum, teachers complained that there was no actual curriculum at all.

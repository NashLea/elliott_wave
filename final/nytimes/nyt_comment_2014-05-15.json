An interesting note is that between 1995 and 2010 the wealth share for the top 1% decreased from 34.6% to 34.5% -- how could that be possible when they were receiving 60% of all gains during the period 1979 to 2007? Perhaps off-shoring to tax-free havens? Also a look at the World Wealth Report 2013 by Credit Suisse Bank, Databook, shows the median for adults in about 30 countries, the median per adult is below $40,000. In France and Japan it is above $120,000, and in Australia around $200,000. The Federal Reserve shows, Flow of Funds report, page 2, that household net worth has increased to over $80trillion, which is average of $690,000 per household, a level maybe 7% of households own, 93% are below average. We don't need a Constitutional amendment to tax wealth, what is a property tax? And we don't need an international coalition, we can just tax without alignment. What would happen? It's very unlikely, and so what anyway? A financial transaction tax is most feasible. Also, a 4% tax on all wealth above $50 million would bring in about $600 billion a year.

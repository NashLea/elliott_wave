On top of all this, we have no one uninsured !!!  In other words, Canadians are not a pink slip away from loss of coverage, and a medical catastrophe does not bankrupt Canadian families.<br /><br />One of the big cost factors with the U.S. system is the massive bureaucracy that Big Health maintains to 1.) deny initial coverage unless you have no risk factors and 2.) deny payment for treatment received.  In other words, the U.S. already has death panels, only they are in the private sector.<br /><br />As well, since I turned 65 (I'm 67), Provincial drug benefits kicked in, and that, along with my coverage from work, results in my prescription drugs costing me nothing.<br /><br />So, don't believe the lies and propaganda coming out of the right-wing noise machines and toxic-talk radio.  The Canadian system isn't perfect, it does have its flaws, but, all-in-all, I'll take it any day over the system currently in place in the U.S.<br /><br />Americans are a wonderful, great people and they deserve much better than the healthcare system that is the highest cost model in the world and has among the lowest outcomes of any advanced economy.", "recommendationCount": 46}, {"assetID": 2480649, "replies": [], "lft": 476, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/health/policy/05cost.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3480313, "rgt": 477, "userDisplayName": "Richard", "createDate": "1299298172", "userID": 16843770, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299301216", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299301216", "commentSequence": 238, "commentBody": "#26; \"hear yea\", \"hear yea\"!", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2480649, "replies": [], "lft": 478, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/health/policy/05cost.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3480320, "rgt": 479, "userDisplayName": "DK Lewis", "createDate": "1299298283", "userID": 53230386, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299301216", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Oregon", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299301216", "commentSequence": 239, "commentBody": "The cost of health care is relentlessly rising because the physicians and hospitals have oligopoly pricing power.<br /><br />LOL.

I would submit to you that all but Gyan's match winner today were PRIMARILY attrbutable to poor midfield play:<br />Vs. England, Ricardo Clark loses track of Gerrard, who is all alone to take the wall pass and use the outside of the foot to flick it past Howard.<br />Vs. Solvenia, Birsa was allowed to drift behind Bradley into acres of space, unaccounted for by his midfield counterpart. He was allowed to wind up and hit a screamer past Howard. Here I disagree with my friend Lazar (LT) who would like to attribute this one to Onyewu. Onyewu was late to arrive, but the defense is not generally responsible for shots taken from 30 yards. Michael Bradley's bad right there. The second Slovene goal was again created by a midfielder with the time and space to pick out the runner who could beat the offside trap. Onyewu botched the trap, but for me this one was 60-40% midfield-defense culpability.<br />Vs. Ghana, Ricardo Clark gave up the ball with one small jostle. Boateng was able to ram it down our throats. For this one, I'd assess culpability as 35% midfield for giving it away and no cover from Bradley, the partner in the middle, 35% defense (DeMerit) for failing to challenge Boateng, and 30% to Howard for giving up his near post.<br /><br />I agree with you wholeheartedly about the problems in defense and on the forward line.<br /><br />But I will continue to excoriate BB for several reasons:<br />Why is the team so unready to play from the outset. Four matches, three in which we conceded within 13 minutes (and a tenth minute crossbar smash from Algeria, too. Not only that, but we REPEATED the fatal mistake in extra time. Route 1 on a punt right between the two central defenders in the first three minutes of XT? NOT ACCEPTABLE. Responsible party for the team being ready to play is Bob Bradley.<br />After experimenting with midfield partners for his son, starting with Ricardo Clark, then having a nightmare from Torres, and finally using Edu for the second half vs. Slovenia and vs. Algeria, why, oh why was he back tinkering with Clark again. Giveaway for a goal, a yellow card that might well have been red (it was a leg breaker) and subbed off in 30 minutes. What more proof do you need that BB screwed the pooch? You can tinker with the lineup in friendlies (there were three in the last month) and in the group stage, but how can you not have a  lineup set once the knockout phase begins? In BBs behalf, I was one of Bornstein's harshest critics, but BBs faith in him was rewarded. He was solid and good in the last two matches. But on the other hand, he brought and used Onyewu who was clearly unfit, but steadfastly refused to take a flyer on Charlie Davies. In my days of coaching youth soccer, I would always tell my friends that a weak forward can't kill you, but a weak defender can kill you deader than Elvis. Could Davies, despite his physical condition, really have been as ineffectual as Findley was? A team with aspirations to the quarters or semis of the WC has to have a forward who can bury the chance that Findley, off the Ghanaian midfield turnover, put right off of Kingson's foot. DeMerit is a nice player, but he is, as they say, punching well above his weight. He's on Watford, a middle of the second division side. So ianicol, in sumary, my issues with BB are no more fundamental than game preparation, squad choices, tactical blundering and evaluation of personnel he has used. Other than that, I'm fine with him.

I have been reading the New York Times since 1965,  I read it when I went into the Marines in the Vietnam War, I read it when I finished my degree during Watergate.  The New York Times keeps outdoing itself, and this series will uncover issues with the way we see this new kind of war that was started by two people who ignored Santayana's aphorism, \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"<br />   But yes, Seymour Hersh is correct, that there is a problematical bias in some reporting when it comes from sources collocated with military units.  This bias is not only driven by embedding, but also by an idealism of first-time war reporters.  But we should be able to analyze this reporting against other sources to uncover the subtle issues in this complex war.  I miss Drew Middleton's military analyses and this is what's required now.<br />   As news sources collapse and yield to nonsensical blog opinion, there is pressure on professional news organizations to provide the analysis that intelligent people need to build an understanding of Asian military tactics and geopolitics.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 476, "replies": [], "lft": 36, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/belgium/brussels/restaurants.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3091772, "rgt": 37, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1277632493", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1277632493", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "userSuggestion", "updateDate": "1277646128", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "before eating in down-town go to the Champagnotheque,located in\"les Galeries Royales-st Hubert\" a broad choice of famous Champagnes you can taste from 6 to 12 euros the glass.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1597924, "replies": [], "lft": 24, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/opinion/27rich.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2183680, "rgt": 25, "userDisplayName": "rlk", "createDate": "1277592718", "userID": 1974754, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1277633737", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "chappaqua, ny", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1277630137", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "While this is certainly an indictment of the main stream media and even Obama's team, the real bottom line to all of this drama is that Obama now has a unique opportunity to end the Afghanistan fiasco.<br /><br />Gen.

Congress is insanely partisan, dysfunctional, and mostly bought.  The military won't tell the truth except in closed hearings.  The financial sector is still fighting meaningful reform and hoping that derivatives will insure its failures at others' expense.  Our energy sector is bent on exploiting fossil fuels until they run dry or poison our plant, whichever comes first.  The Catholic Church protected pedophiles.  Many Jews support an Israeli settlement policy indistinguishable from slow-motion conquest.  Science still works, but no one pays it much heed, either on global warming or on how to stop the BP Oil Spill.

But we scratched our brand new car in Vietnam, and now we should just drive it.  We should use a cold, clear-headed cost-benefit analysis at every stage of every conflict.  If we do that, we should know that the costs of remaining in Afghanistan after nine relatively fruitless years outweigh any conceivable benefit. A Taliban victory is virtually inevitable, so we should do our best, on the way out, to make sure the best Taliban win.  (No, they are not all alike.)<br /><br />The task of reforming and remaking every institution in our society lies before us.  It will take decades.

These are not saints; they are soldiers. Obama is the commander in chief, and he made a decision, albeit the wrong one. In fairness to the U.S. armed forces sent by Obama to Afghanistan, was it not his responsibility also to demand that Biden, et al, refrain from public expressions of skepticism?

That strategy worked far better than anything that the U.S. has tried anywhere, and it must rank as one of the most cost-effective. We, on the other hand, have spent hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan, long after most of Al Qaeda fled --- to send tens of thousands of troops with often inadequate cultural sensitivity and restraint, to drop bombs and fire missiles and cause civilian casualties, in the process generating tremendous animosity in an insular society based so strongly on religion and family and tribal allegiances. Wonder \"why do they hate us?\". News flash: for the most part, it AIN'T \"because they hate our freedom\".<br /><br />We cannot \"win\" in Afghanistan, in the traditional military sense of that term to mean vanquish and control. There are many reasons why Afghanistan is known as \"The Graveyard of Empires\". The British came to know that, as did eventually the Soviets. How long will it take the U.S. to learn? The methods of insurgency change over the centuries, but they share a remarkable cost-effectiveness. Nowadays, a $3 million Stryker armored vehicle can be destroyed, and its occupants killed or maimed, with an IED made from a leftover artillery shell and a $5 remote control. The clinical phrase \"asymmetric warfare\" doesn't even begin to describe what the U.S. is facing there.<br /><br />The only way for the U.S. to \"win\" (aside from the preferable \"declare victory and get out\") is to redefine that word \"win\" as \"perhaps influence\", throttle way back on attempts at a military victory, and direct nearly all of our Afghanistan effort (and spending) to infrastructure improvement --- both physical and social services --- in areas that are already secure. Transform those areas into (relative) paradises, and thereby make the population on the outside dissatisfied with what they have, comparatively, in areas controlled by our opponents. (To those Americans who wish to focus on fighting, who might say that no areas are secure enough for an infrastructure improvement strategy --- despite nearly nine years of U.S. involvement --- well, you've just made the case for leaving, unconditionally, right now).<br /><br />To a very large extent (but with appropriate financial oversight to minimize corruption), these projects should be designed and built by the people of Afghanistan, not high-priced Western consultants and contractors. (Don't tell me that there are no Afghani civil engineers or public health professionals; such a claim is Western-centric arrogance). Beyond being vastly more cost-effective, Afghani design and construction would give the people there an important psychological and economic stake in the enterprise. If their national or provincial governments can't or won't move infrastructure projects along, empower local development councils to do so.<br /><br />Of course, I don't expect any part of such a strategy to be adopted, since we're not even willing to concern ourselves with needed infrastructure and social services on U.S. soil. Plus, the U.S. military-industrial complex will vigorously fight any decrease in spending for the war machine, and most politicians both Democrat and Republican remain its enthusiastic lackeys, striving to outdo each other in feeding the beast. Some politicians (very wrongly) believe in American militarism as a desirable course of action; others are simply giving value for money to their corporate contributors; still others are just gutless wonders who prefer to sacrifice the infrastructure --- and future --- of this country rather than risk their own political careers by bringing sanity to our military spending and explaining to their constituents why American militarism-as-usual can't continue. And in the end times of the American Empire, too many Americans would rather cling to a paranoid yet arrogant imperial militarism than face the facts about how the world works and the limits of our power, and our important domestic problems that should take precedence.<br /><br />Where is the leadership that we need?", "recommendationCount": 374}, {"assetID": 1597924, "replies": [], "lft": 26, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/opinion/27rich.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2183700, "rgt": 27, "userDisplayName": "pvolkov", "createDate": "1277593247", "userID": 40468540, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1277634261", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Burlington, Ontario", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1277630661", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "\"The gaping discrepancy between Emanuel\u2019s upbeat assessment and the reality on the ground went unremarked because absolutely no one was paying attention.

I will try to correct and clarify the ideas:<br/><br/>Assume k &gt; 3, and n is an odd prime, and A, B, C, and D are any four consecutive vertices of P.  We know that (AB)^2 and (BC)^2 and (CD)^2 are integers divisible by n.  Also, because all vertices have integral coordinates, the squares of all side lengths and diagonal lengths are integers.<br/><br/>By Ptolemy\u2019s theorem, (AB)(CD) + (BC)(AD) = (AC)(BD).  We square both sides to get:<br/><br/> [(AB)^2 ][(CD)^2]+ 2(AB)(CD)(BC)(AD) + [(BC)^2][(AD)^2]<br/> = [(AC)^2][(BD)^2]<br/><br/>The term 2(AB)(CD)(BC)(AD) is an integer, since all other terms in the equation are integers.<br/><br/>Note that [(AB)^2 ][(CD)^2] and [(BC)^2][(AD)^2] are both divisible by n.  Furthermore, 2(AB)(CD)(BC)(AD) is divisible by n, since it is an integer whose square must be divisible by n^3.<br/><br/>We see that [(AC)^2][(BD)^2] is divisible by n, as it is a sum of integers all divisible by n.  So since (AC)^2 and (BD)^2 are integers whose product is divisible by n, polygon P must have a diagonal (either AC or BD) the square of whose length is divisible by n.  This completes the induction on k for the case with n being an odd prime.<br/><br/>We next have to generalize the proof to allow n to be a power of an odd prime.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3455989, "replies": [], "lft": 80, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/supposed-consequence/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 19217066, "rgt": 81, "userDisplayName": "Mac Knight", "createDate": "1469073621", "userID": 65278019, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1469073667", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Yakima, WA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1469070067", "commentSequence": 19217066, "commentBody": "Great theme, well executed.

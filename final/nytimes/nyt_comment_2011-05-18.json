But why in the world is the DOJ contributing our tax dollars to help fund this illegitimate \"study\" and report? I truly would like an answer, but won't hold my breath waiting for it.<br/><br/>Born and raised a Catholic, in the '60s I was educated first by Dominicans and then by Jesuits. Before completing my undergraduate studies at a Jesuit institution, I left the Church. My only regret is that I cannot leave it again and again. This egregious report reaffirms for me that the Roman Catholic Church has neither credibility nor moral authority. John Jay has now enjoys the same reputation and character, a situation of its own making.<br/><br/>I have not read the report, but I am confident that the concept that the Church has always been about itself, and never about the faithful people in its pews, was never explored by the \"researchers.\"  Claiming that priests were poorly prepared and monitored during a time of novel open sexual expression is an affront to intelligence, if not the soul. The Church was always supremely prepared -- to deal with scandal. Its  recent problem is that its time-honored, reliable technique - squelching public awareness by pressuring pious priests and faithful Catholics in influential positions into silence for the greater good of THE CHURCH, and judicious use of bribery and/or threats when all else fails - no longer serves in the Information Age. Chalk that up to the influence of the times, digital communication, cameras in cell phones,  and perhaps the specter of Wikileaks. Nonetheless, the Church remains THE CHURCH and unequivocally believes its own institutional good to be superior to the interests or needs of the laity. Its own hierarchy is so steeped in this tradition that it is blind to the fact that what worked in the past works no longer. The world sees The Church for what it is, and is repulsed. But the hierarchy is blind to that, as well. It keeps trying to whitewash the black rot, blame others, and make trivial, token statements pretending to accept some responsibility for the horrors its clergy committed. The Church knew all along what was gong on, but had no interest in stopping it, much less bringing the perps to justice. It was only interested in keeping it a secret. But now, even though the cat has long since been out of the bag and the world has expressed its condemnation, THE CHURCH still cannot fathom that the world sees through its posturing, pretexts and pretenses. How it will end, I cannot imagine.

It is only the supposed elite that are getting their boorish comments posted in the headlines, stirring up anti-French sentiment, and causing a culture clash of great size. It's a pity.

Anti-Israel sentiment has been building up in the last few weeks in that most crucial of all Arab countries: Egypt. At first there were only hundreds chanting pro-Palestine slogans, and then there were thousands the next week, and last week there were tens of thousands. At this rate, the support for Palestinians will be enormous, and it will inevitably have results and repercussions for the Israel-Egypt relationship. I hope President Obama will get good advice to devote a significant portion of his planned speech next week to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and that he will speak convincingly and forcefully of the importance of establishing Palestine in the very near future.<br/><br/>Yesh Prabhu, Bushkill, Pennsylvania", "recommendationCount": 11}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

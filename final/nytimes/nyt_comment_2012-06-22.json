But far too often, privatization is about replacing public services with a crass form of white collar patronage in which wealthy CEOs and campaign donors get rich, while middle class jobs get replaced with minimum wage, no benefit privatized jobs.<br/><br/>As I noted in last night's comment on this same topic, there are three factors beyond sticker price to evaluate when considering privatization:  <br/><br/>1. Service. While sometimes the profit motive provides better service, other times it can reduce the quality of service. When it comes to something like making sure prisoners don\u2019t escape or our children get educated, poor quality and cutting corners can be costly.<br/><br/>2. Democracy. One reason for services to be public is to make sure everyone has access (such as with the Post Office), or to ensure that certain services aren\u2019t provided excessively (such as with prisons). Privatization frequently undermines those goals.<br/><br/>3. Workers. Where privatization promises cost savings, it often comes from replacing middle class jobs with minimum wage jobs. But doing so is often not worth it in the long run, as such workers are more likely to need other government services and an economic of rich and poor is less vibrant than one with a stable middle class. <br/><br/>These factors demonstrates that privatization is often pure folly.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a> ", "recommendationCount": 25}, {"assetID": 3326914, "replies": [], "lft": 222, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/opinion/krugman-prisons-privatization-patronage.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 6473665, "rgt": 223, "userDisplayName": "daj", "createDate": "1340338925", "userID": 45907913, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1340339000", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1340335400", "commentSequence": 36, "commentBody": "Great column.

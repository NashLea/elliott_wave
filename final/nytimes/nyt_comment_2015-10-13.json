Analysis of the 529 plans showed they were used overwhelmingly by the wealthy for tax avoidance purposes, just like the home interest deduction.

This has help tremendously my wife and I who work in public higher education.  My is a licensed speech pathologist who used to work for a non-profit hospital and started school before Obama was president.  She has to pay 15% on her loans; I pay 10%.  Given the paltry salaries of most rank-and-file higher education employees (contrary to popular misconception), this is a life-altering help.  I do not know what better example you want of pre-Obama post-Obama than the 10%-15%.  What's more, this is a research interest of mine and Obama has gone after for-profits with gainful employment rules, college scorecard, proposed rating system, Warren's financial consumer protection agency; in short, everything he can think of to go around their powerful allies in congress who block reform at the expense of everyone but the 1%.

My point is that the way to help them should not involve punishing those who work and save to afford college.  The Obama administration has tried to help the lower quartile by taking from the second quartile.  It's actually been a lazy, not heroic, strategy.  Lazy because taking away tax incentivized savings plans like the 529 is just low-lying fruit held by the middle class, not structural change that requires much more effort and risk.  Rather than proposing taking away the 529s, why didn't the Obama administration lower the interest rates on Federal student loans? Why didn't they cap tuition increases on public universities that receive major Federal aid in the form of grants?  Why didn't they do ANYTHING to stem the escalation of college costs?  No. Instead they tried to strip one of the few vehicles available to those who CAN save.

Over in surrounding counties, the commuter trains and buses have sporadic schedules that can only work for those with regular work schedules, but if that's not the case, then you are better off driving.  Seriously, I'm getting tired of subway riders complaining about fare hikes when they are really the lowest among so many other hikes.  When tolls go up, they don't go up in quarters, they go up almost by an entire dollar or even more.  Another truth is here that transit is perversely funded by those with little or no access to it.  Before anyone says that driving is heavily subsidized by those who don't use that, it's actually not the case, because only the infrastructure that is being used is subsidized while the vehicles themselves aren't.  In other words, when I have to get my car serviced something of it renewed from the DMV, it doesn't come cheap and some of it has increased in the last decade as well.

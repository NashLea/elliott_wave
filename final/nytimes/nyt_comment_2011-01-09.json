To put this second question another way, If we objectively examine the relationship between global human population numbers and the total supply of food for human consumption, are absolute global human population numbers the dependent variable or the independent variable?<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2268172, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/7-billion-and-counting/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3190968, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Steven Earl Salmony", "createDate": "1294497916", "userID": 57074419, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294549454", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chapel Hill, NC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294549454", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Responses to the two questions above from Professor Emeritus Gary L. Peters<br /><br />Hi Steve,<br /><br />Some people will never comprehend what humans are doing to our planet and I don't know how to convince them otherwise......As for your two questions, I'll try briefly to answer them.<br /><br />1.  In his introduction to the 150th anniversary edition of Darwin's The Origin of Species, Sir Julian Huxley wrote that \"As regards man, it became ever clearer that he had originated from an ancestor sufficiently ape-like to be placed in the same group with the existing great apes.  Man could no longer be regarded as the Lord of Creation, a being apart from the rest of nature.  He was merely the representative of one among many Families of the order Primates in the class Mammalia.\"<br /><br />2.  The second question if far more complicated.  Like all other animals, human numbers cannot grow beyond the supply of food available to them.  However, unlike all other animals, humans have the capacity to increase food supplies to feed growing populations.  Historically there has been a two-way relationship between our numbers and food supplies.  When food was abundant, human numbers grew; when food was scarce, human numbers decreased.  Since population growth threatened decreases in living standards for early populations, such growth often stimulated innovation, leading us into the Neolithic and the beginning of agriculture.  Subsequently, we have tended to find ways to use ever more energy to increase food supplies, starting with the use of domesticated animals to help improve agricultural production, then to irrigation projects, etc.  When we succeeded populations grew; when we failed, they stagnated or declined.  Populations rose and fell historically as famines, diseases, wars, and mortality staked their claims.  These cyclical fluctuations were with our species until only recently, when humans began to tap into nonanimate sources of energy, especially coal, then oil, and finally natural gas.  Coupled with scientific progress in agriculture, transportation, etc., humans were able to corral the four horsemen and create a surge in population growth that continues today.  So long as we are able to keep producing more food, we will be able to sustain further population growth.  However, there will be limits.  One of them may be the peaking of oil production, which, if it hasn't already occurred, will almost certainly occur within the next few years.  After that, further food production may be constrained by rising energy prices.<br /><br />I don't know how many more people we might be able to feed, but I don't know why we want to maximize the number of people on the planet.  Human population growth cannot continue without taking an ever heavier toll on the environment that gives us life and on the creatures with which we share the planet.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Gary<br />", "recommendationCount": 19}, {"assetID": 2269267, "replies": [], "lft": 2700, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3193943, "rgt": 2701, "userDisplayName": "SenBernieRocks", "createDate": "1294527589", "userID": 62101466, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294549489", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "USA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294549489", "commentSequence": 991, "commentBody": "Prayers and thoughts to the victims of this senseless violence.<br /><br />Palin and a certain network have to realize that their audience is inspired by their kind of rhetoric.

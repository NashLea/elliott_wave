We cannot wait until the redistricting of 2020 following the next census.  The answer now is to work every day in every state to register Democratic voters, even and most especially where the voting laws are being rigged to suppress them, and then to get all Democrats to the polls every election day, beginning in 2014.  Registration should be on-going, NOW, but most organizations such as OFA quit the day after the 2012 election.  Even today, the new OFA is concerned only with  \"issues\" and getting Obama's agenda passed, not with voter registration.  This is short-sighted; none of Obama's agenda will be passed by this Republican Congress.<br/><br/>As our problems are caused by manipulations of voting, so is our solution possible only through voting. The power of GOP gerrymandering is not limitless, and there are enough unregistered or disaffected potential voters in most voting districts to overcome any gerrymandering scheme. In that way, and no other, lies the salvation of the country.

It could not have been easier than this! The location is perfect for hitting the main historical attractions and also only a short walk down to the ferries for the Bosphorus cruises.<br /><br />The staff were helpful and polite. We were picked up by airport transfer in a very grand car and the rooms were clean and pretty. Ours had a large balcony too. Sometimes the shower water was a little tempremental but aside from that it was perfect!<br /><br />If you are in Istanbul for the weekend then this is the perfect place as its close to everything you'd want to see and the staff really help you out.<br /><br />My top suggestion for Istanbul is to visit the Blue  House Hotel's roof terrace. Its the highest point between the Blue Mosque and Haigha Sophia and the staff are super-helpful and friendly. Go at sunset, order a pipe and a beer and some little tapas bits and watch the sun set over the Bosphorus. A little slice of pure happiness.

First off, the Clinton Foundation has actually done a lot of good work in the developing world, regardless of whatever ulterior motives its founders may have been harboring. Second, if it were the Clintons who were declining to release their tax returns you KNOW you'd be joining The Donald and every other member of your Party in their inevitable (and completely justified) denunciations. And then, of course, there's the little matter of that Kenyan birth certificate that Mr. Trump claims to have access to but has never bothered to produce (libel laws, anyone?).  Speaking of libel, I'd be very careful about unproven accusations of rape launched against...anyone.<br/>   But, most importantly, whatever gives you the impression that the most divisive figure in American public life can get DC's liberals and conservatives to come together to do what's right for the great unwashed that he loathes and ridicules?  A man who reverses his policy proposals before he can even complete a sentence can hardly be relied upon to convince other people to drop their ideological horsebleep and do something commonsensical.  Never mind Hillary or Bernie; I'd sooner pledge my soul to Lucifer. At least his agenda has been carefully thought out.

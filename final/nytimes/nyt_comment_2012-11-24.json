Her great skill and agenda is the relentless promotion of Sheila Bair.

Nothing has ever been done to contain the financial crisis, so why start now.<br/><br/>My favorite would be Barofsky.  Kaufman is over the hill, and Kelleher would be more useful in his present role.  The outcome of this battle will be very instructive, but it is quite predictable.  Another possibility would be that Miller is knocked out of the running and another industry toad is chosen who is seen as less controverial due to not having been as thoroughly vetted.

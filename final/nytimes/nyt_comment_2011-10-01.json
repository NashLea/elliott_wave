It seems they didn't go too far, after all.  Due process of law isn't really as important as those who believe in and trust the Constitution would have you think. <br/><br/>But before the Right and Left get too deep into celebrating, they should be careful to mind this advice\" whatever you do, don't look too threatening to those bureaucrats who now have the power to kill you at will.

There was no such debate over the killing of thousands of non-US civilians who are bombed in their homes and in wedding processions in attacks carried out on other countries.

Would people say that if a policeman sees an American citizen pointing a gun at another American citizen and shoots him to stop the gunman from killing the victim - is that wrong? But what about a trial?  Due process is not possible when a terrorist is hiding in a lawless area and is heavily guarded. This terrorist had a gun pointed at our heads and it was justified to take him out to protect his intended victims.

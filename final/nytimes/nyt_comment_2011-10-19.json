In the hope that this may be at least marginally helpful to the protesters, I am suggesting below, for a start, two specific demands that seem to emerge most frequently from from those legitimate and justified complaints.\r<br/><br/>1.  Institute public financing of political campaigns and elections.

(I say \u201cridiculous\u201d because it compares your and my individual voice with the deafening roar of Exxon-Mobil, Goldman-Sachs or Microsoft) So this would be an uphill battle, but it is cause entirely worthy of all the efforts and sacrifices of the OWS demonstrators.<br/>\n2. Reenact the Glass-Steagall Act or its current formulation \u2013 the Volcker Rule. This would prohibit banks from commingling its \u201ccommercial\u201d (aka \u201cretail\u201d) banking operations with their investment operations, and do away with the incongruity of an \u201cinvestment bank.\u201d (You are either a bank or an investment brokerage, not both).

But democratic processes include more than simply voting every four years. True democratic leadership sets up democratic processes that listen and integrate and revise and correct rather than simply issuing edicts.

This is an instance in which we need democratic culture to work. <br/><br/>There are disagreements and misunderstandings that could be worked through with more discussion. For example, I do not agree that the edict in this case is similar to the process of women's winning the right to vote. I also do not believe that the civil rights analogies are correct. The AG makes it sound as if having \"Male\" and \"Female\" rest rooms is equivalent to segregation and Jim Crow. I also do not believe that the issue of locker rooms and the repercussions more broadly have been thought through. I could change my mind on some issues, but the federal government has decided that it is morally and culturally superior to us citizens and doesn't have to respect our benighted concerns. Instead it will use its power and force over us. I agree that this is bold, but I also believe that pushing the issue so far beyond transgender rights and dignity threatens the effort to protect trans people's rights and dignity, as well as the rights and dignity of non-trans citizens. I believe that it is a bad decision. It comes partly from the blindness and felt superiority of having power.

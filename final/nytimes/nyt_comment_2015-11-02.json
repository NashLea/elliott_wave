Nothing the hospital does for the doctor's practice justifies such an increase. We need some competition in medicine. If hospitals can charge unnecessary \"facility fee\" independent physicians can not compete, and the cost of medical care escalates unnecessarily. It's time that congress stood up to the hospital lobby and banned facility fees, and not reimburse hospitals at a higher rate than independent physicians. Congress should then go after the pharmaceutical companies for abusing patent protection and overcharging, and also prevent hedge fund operators from buying companies that manufacture generic drugs and overcharging. Too much of the healthcare dollar is going to administrative overhead, investor profit, and insurance administrative costs. Many of the costs are often hidden and on paper are presented as direct costs for medical care, such as the cost of a doctor's time spent providing documentation for prior authorization, and other documentation unnecessary for direct medical care. We need to better identify what is the actual cost for medication, and for direct services without the demands of third party payor and auditors, Then if such documentation demands are placed on clinicians they should be identified as administrative overhead and appropriate limits placed on that expense.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3440983, "replies": [], "lft": 1000, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/business/dealbook/in-arbitration-a-privatization-of-the-justice-system.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 16540733, "rgt": 1001, "userDisplayName": "mancuroc", "createDate": "1446443226", "userID": 12582762, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1446443286", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Rochester, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1446443286", "commentSequence": 16540733, "commentBody": "Bernie Sanders said that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street, Wall Street regulates congress.

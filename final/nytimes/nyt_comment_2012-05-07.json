Unless, of course, if you're a Democrat. We live in a funny society, where bald-faced lying is a way of life, explained away by a fawning liberal press.  Bill Clinton got away with lying under oath, Obama lies every time he makes a speech, Warren lies on her Harvard application.  Why have we fallen so far as a society, where lying is not only excused, but held up as the new standard?

It is ludicrous to presume that being a racial or ethnic minority in the U.S. provides economic advantages.

Is there a belief that minorities are less qualified or less deserving or not real Americans? Does Mr. Brown et al., believe that a superior white guy was denied some privilege he was entitled to because Dr. Warren identified as Cherokee?  What does he believe other minorities in Massachusetts deserve? Does he wish to cut student loans, unemployment benefits, programs to help domestic violence victims because \"those people\" are not equal to him?

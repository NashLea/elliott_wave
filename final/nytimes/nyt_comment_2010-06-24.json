Alexander Haig was lambasted during the Reagan presidency for his famous, or infamous, statement of \"I am in charge here\". Later some of my readings about this incident have presented Mr. Haig in a different and more positive light. Maybe he used a poor choice of words; but his intentions were clear and even honorable. Apparently that is still up for debate. Of course in those days, I walked in the safety of a serene college campus and slept peaceably close by in a small off campus apartment. Years before I slept in the mud and walked under the eerie triple canopy jungle near to the Cambodian border. On a few days in late March and early April, 1967 then Lt. Col. Alexander Haig demonstrated not only outstanding personal bravery, but clear and direct decisive military skills that eventually saved many of our fellow soldiers in the midst of a battle that saw our unit outnumbered at least three to one. At the time human wave attacks were then used to describe one night battle. Officers were relieved in our unit in months prior to that event called the battle of Ap Gu. At least one relieved officer was in my opinion dangerously, if not criminally, inept. He was dismissed from our line unit and we all moved on smartly, as it was said in those days. Our President justifiably removed General Mc Chrystal because at this moment young troops are not only sleeping rough, but are in harms way. Besides the grand view of the mission, I trust that our president was also thinking of those who sleep and walk tonight in very different places than television pundits, political advisors and indeed than four star generals.

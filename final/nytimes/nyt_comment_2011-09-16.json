Come on, Mr. Brooks, you can do better than that.  <br/><br/>The story of the Great Depression is that FDR came to office with our economy rapidly collapsing. He took numerous steps during the first 100 days to reinstate confidence, and then used government spending to get the economy going again. By early 1937, things were improving, with economic growth increasing and unemployment decreasing. Then, conservative thoughts about austerity and tight monetary standards took over in 1937 and the results were predictable - the economy crashed again.  FDR quickly realized the mistake and a return to New Deal policies began another recovery. Then World War II came along, which created a massive increase in government spending and, not surprisingly, brought the country in a full recovery and rapid economic growth. <br/><br/>A similar story can be seen with the Bush Recession and President Obama's stimulus bill, which stopped the free fall the economy was in when President Obama came into office. Unfortunately, Republicans and \"moderate\" Democrats prevented the stimulus from being big enough to achieve a full recovery, and the GOP did everything it could after the initial stimulus to prevent job creation. As a result, unemployment remains high, economic growth remains low, and the deficits continue to be inflated by a lack of government revenue. <br/><br/>Government stimulus is pure common sense. At a time of economic problems, individuals do not have money to spend, and corporations do not want to invest money due to a lack of demand. In such situation, only government can generate demand. If we want to fix our economy and reduce the deficit, that is exactly what government needs to do now, starting with passage of Obama's American Jobs Act. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 584}, {"assetID": 3234445, "replies": [], "lft": 18, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/opinion/brooks-the-planning-fallacy.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4525900, "rgt": 19, "userDisplayName": "Jon Jost", "createDate": "1316140785", "userID": 14034119, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1316146052", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seoul", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1316142452", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "\"...if a Republican president were in office right now, and even if he or she did sensible things, the economy would still be in the dumps. \"<br/><br/>Mr Brooks elides the matter that a large part of the reason the economy is in the state it is in is directly attributable to Republican policies emplaced by Republican Presidents - from Reagan to Bush: tax cuts for the richest, for corporations; two unfunded wars, failure to deal with the energy crisis long ago and instead the constant prompting to spend more and more.

Governments throughout the western world spent to keep the good times going - and themselves in power.  AFter the 1960s the over spending and taxation created the problems of inflation and stagflation.  The promises of government overarching control were seen as faulty.  Hence the Reagan and Thatcher elections and the scaling back of the government is infallible philosophy.<br/><br/>Just as the liberal view of government went too far so do has the conservative view.  Conservatives have changed from wanting to limit government to its minimal and hopefully effective level to advocating no government at all for virtually anything.

Worse, there was no outcry, no negative reaction at all in that crowd to those cheering for the uninsured to die.  No candidate saying anything from the podium to those cheers.

Thank you for giving a voice to countless others.  I, too, was brought here when I was very young. My father was recruited for his artistic ability, and, at the age of 5, I became an undocumented immigrant, an illegal, or whatever you feel most comfortable calling me.  We never went on welfare.  We could not have even if we wanted to.  You have to be legal to get welfare, but my dad would have shot himself rather than ask for a handout.<br/>\nThen, in the mid 80s, the Reagan administration saw fit to allow many, many of us to become legal. I was too young to know the difference, and, honestly, there wasn't any.  My dad still went to work every day, my mom still babysat to help put food on the table, and I still went to school every day.<br/>\nEventually, I attended three top universities, became a citizen, earned a doctorate and landed a great job at a very prestigious campus. THIS is what we accomplish when given the chance.  I understand the resentment of those who argue we should wait in line.  My response is that we were children.  Nobody asked us if we wanted to come here, but many expect we can just \"go back\" to places we unknown and cultures not ours.<br/>\nI truly believe part of the anger against us stems from the fact that folks can't tell if we're legal by looking at us.  My family portrait contains legal residents, naturalized citizens, natural born citizens, and illegals.  It must be really frustrating to not know whom to aim the anger towards, so I see why it is thrown out in generalities.<br/>\nGood luck, Mr. Vargas.

If it's in our national interest to destroy al-Quaeda (wherever they are by the way) and have a stable government in Afghanistan, then that's what it takes.   As far as the Iraq adventure is concerned, I can't say that the lesser of the two evils was to have Sadam Hussein remain in power (who managed to stabilize the region with a Stalin-like iron fist) than the chaos that reigns there now.  I would not be bothered by a quick withdrawal from Iraq unless a weakened Iraq emboldens the tryrannical theocracy in Iran. Unlike the Leftist critics I note in these comments (who seem to be all-wise and all-knowing), I just don't know enough.

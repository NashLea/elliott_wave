I say, go after the \u201cwatergates\u2019hammer and tong but the constant drilling for news just for the sake of programming, well that\u2019s an abuse of the system and one shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to oblige that.<br /><br />There are certainly many who reach or aspire to the gravity of the true purpose and potential of responsible journalism.  Take the writings of a political figure like Nobel Peace Price winner Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, who published many essays in Japanese newspapers and elsewhere.  People like her, who make statements such as this in her famous  'Freedom From Fear' speech: \"It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.\"  That\u2019s a sound bite worth reading. Especially since she backs it up by overcoming that  corrupting fear with her own life. It's not just a job.<br /><br />The public deserves access to its governmental representatives through responsible journalism. But when so much of news today resembles  a Jerry Springer free-for-all sometimes you feel like you're the 'mark' of news dealers who supply the junkies with bad street grade 'non news'.  Who can blame someone for needing a break from that?<br /><br />Sometimes it would seen that it\u2019s actually more responsible to slam the door in order to marshall your energies more effectively than reflexively and constantly feeding the \u2018dog of blog\u2019 -the news that never sleeps and its arterial feeds ---  When they say : \"On Balance\"  news...they often mean....balanced on the almighty dollar--dollars milks from a a gov't official's precious time.....money Clear Channel invests in Wall Street.\u2026.for instance.<br /><br />Give a guy a break once in a while\u2026<br />Finally, anyone who is interviewed knows the frustration of being melded in print, or out of context, into a reporter\u2019s slanted agenda; an agenda set by the Big Boss for big ratings at the media hive,  That\u2019s dumb. It\u2019s frustrating and a waste of our time.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1451811, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/kagans-video-on-white-house-blog/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1997891, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "Celeste", "createDate": "1274150755", "userID": 53027991, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1274156673", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "IL", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1274153073", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "I find the description \"warm\" somewhat puzzling.

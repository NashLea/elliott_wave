Yes, many of us only have M.A. degrees, which qualify us as lecturers as opposed to tenure-track professorships.  We get to teach in community colleges and freshman courses when enrollment demands extra coverage, usually in the fall and winter terms, in the core-requirement courses, and in the remedial courses (which unfortunately have become permanent offerings at the freshman level).  But cases I have known about, the quality of teaching often surpasses the work of professors.  For one thing, \"We try harder.\"  For another, we are generally as well-prepared as the average doctoral t.a.  Also, given the support and respect of the department, we do have academic freedom to teach in creative ways and we often enjoy professional recognition.  Finally, we are so darn happy to actually be in a college classroom teaching, rather than pounding the pavement in the stultifying perpetual job search, that we find the work personally rewarding, regardless of the pay.<br/>As for the federal government dropping the gavel--it is the federal loan guarantee to the schools that has sweetened the deal, just as it has with FHA and VA mortgage loans.

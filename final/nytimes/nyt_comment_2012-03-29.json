When someone, too poor to afford coverage, goes to the emergency rooms for coughs, fevers or whatever minor aliment, and then costing the taxpayers exorbitant charges from those hospitals, which system is best?<br/>\nAre we that stupid to not see the correlation between service and charges? Protection of our poor? How about just having the best medical system available to all? Socialized medicine... a dirty word, but absolutely the only answer to this ridiculous situation.

Almost all those options were not available on a mac. Why? Apple is so sure they know what's best they don't allow enough personalization of use. There are three different ways to do everything in Windows.<br/>\nI plan to put Windows on its own partition. The question is how small can I make for the partition for the mac OS.

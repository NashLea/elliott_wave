Seeing the Cup presented directly to Mark Messier, in New York and Edmonton, provided incredible moments and iconic images of unrehearsed bliss. The staged coldness of the NFL presentation pales beside the joyous, spontaneous celebrations of the athletic warriors. The NFL does almost everything right, but this is one thing they do wrong.

Will we wind up with yet more new agencies with yet more throngs and hordes of tight lipped agents twisting our arms to obtain plea deals? Who will pay for their uniforms, firearms, SUV's and sunglasses? Perhaps the taxes on royalties should be increased? More likely there would be an increase in \"user fees\" at the few \"legitimate\" websites looking to control and protect their monopolies.

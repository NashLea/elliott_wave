My parents were 2nd and 4th grade educated and yet with the help of a honors public high school (Lowell) and a quality university (San Francisco State) and University of Colorado, I have a PhD and have had a great life as a professor, consultant, and public policy person.<br/>Yet today children like me have no such opportunity.<br/>To me the biggest cause is the corruption of Congress wherein they only serve the wealthy who pay for their elections. State level is similar but has a different cause as well, Medicaid.<br/>In Colorado, and most state, health care took just one percent of state budgets in the 1970's since corporations paid for everyone's health care. Higher Education got about 25 percent of general state taxes and tuition was low enough to provide access with limited jobs and debt.<br/>Now Medicaid takes 25% of state budgets and tuition pays for higher education. This is not only a cause of inequality but an eating of our seat corn for the future. All to make billionaires more money, and congress more money as well. shame on them!. For profit should not exist in higher education, K12 education, or health care. That greed is killing America. And I am a business professor who used to believe in American capitalism until I saw it start destroying our children and our future.

Generally, the 'Starbuck Lounges' are actually student spaces that would exist anyway, with a Starbucks coffee operating within as an outside vendor.

Meals--again, the cost of meals is paid for by students.  There are usually several meal plans to choose from, and those who live off campus can cook whatever they please.  The money that is spent on women's sports is laughable.  There are also plenty of sports played by males that generate no money, such as wrestling, archery, golf, diving and swimming.  Incidentally, with the exception of wrestling, women play these sports as well, so the 'loss' you refer to is shared by both male and female students.  The college does NOT pay for study abroad programs, and in fact, they also generate money for the college, and only students who wish to participate do so.  I've been to a few Ivy and State gyms.  Don't recall any spas there.  Suite living allows fewer bathroom/shower installations, thereby cutting costs of dorm construction.  When a student graduates and where a student chooses to go to school is again a CHOICE of the student and his/her family, and again, has nothing to do with the rising price of higher education.

Inflation was defined as an increase in the supply of money against the amount of gold available. Then some years later it got changed to an increase in wages and prices, which was related to the unions who were quite successful then at getting good wages and benefits. That is the definition we have now. Obviously it hurts those that have not got increases in incomes as it is today, but it is the wages of the 10% that are inflationary, not the wages of the working class.<br/><br/>Then in the 2000s, the WSJ began targeting Freddie and Fannie as being responsible for economic travails. However the findings of the Angelides<br/>Commission showed  that to be false, but the financial publications kept warning about inflation, and related it to government spending, and went about  convincing people that the government budget was like your personal one, and you could not keep spending. This has been the big noise since the Regan statement about government being the problem.<br/><br/>The inflation fear carries over from the German money printing of the 1920s, to today. We have seen deflation however, and  how much personal wealth that has destroyed, and that seems to be what the conservatives want, in order to shrink the government, and increase the influence of the wealthy.

They do this because the policy makers are the ones that have lots of money on the bank.  They fear inflation more than anything because it robs their savings of buying power, which is their wealth.  So when hard times come, they throw up the barriers to protect what is most emotionally significant to them, their personal assets in the bank.  Whether or not jobs rise or fall does not concern them.  Consequently, they will oppose anything we do today that *might* someday in the unforeseen future cause inflation.

Consider the following facts and then you can decide.  The League of Nations in 1922 established the Mandate for Palestine which recognized the area as the national homeland of the Jews and set it aside for their close settlement on the land.  That land included present day Israel, Jordan, Gaza, West Bank - a 1950 coinage by Jordan for the land it seized in the 1948-49 war, you might find it of interest that the 1947 partition resolution referred to Samaria and Judea.  The Mandate established the basis for settlement under international law and the UN Charter (Art. 80) specifically prohibited any changes to the mandates established by the League of Nations. So, no General Assembly resolution (including the partition resolution which the Arabs rejected anyway) or Security Council  resolution could alter the Jews rights to the land. It really doesn't matter how many partisans pretend otherwise. As a legal matter, there is no \"Palestinian land\" as such since there never was a Palestinian sovereign. You may not like it but those are the facts.<br/>Think of the peace process this way: Israel is being asked - uniquely among all other nations - to surrender lands that international law recognizes as belonging to it.

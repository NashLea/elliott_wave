But what I interpret him to be saying is that he has factored in adjustments to today's now-cast based on historical data that become less relevant as we approach election. For example, the 11/6 forecast made today includes adjustments for the convention bounce. By Sept 30 that adjustment is removed. If that adjustment were holding true, we'd expect that Obama's numbers would have continued to decline this week and next, until that adjustment was removed (and by his published graphs it is pretty clear that Nate has an average decay curve that adjusts the convention adjustment over time). The fact that Obama's numbers appear to be rising slightly over the past week suggests that the 11/6 forecast will move more towards the position of the now cast than vice-versa - hence his wording is technically more correct. This year's results will of course change the next cycle's decay curve to the extent that it deviates - and if I recall correctly, the decay curve is also adjusted for what party is in \"power\" at the time.<br/><br/>That said, there are factors that can't be incorporated into the forecast, unforeseen events for one, vice-presidential picks for another, but more importantly, performance in the debates. I, for one, am putting my money (figuratively) on Obama. He is the original come from behind kid. I think the turning point in the '08 elections came after the national debates.

Furthermore, many have now lost their homes not through foolish speculation, but through job loss resulting from the recession. Now the majority who did not engage in foolish and speculative behavior have been forced to save the country from financial ruin via our taxes.<br /><br />2) Bankers and investment advisors should be held to a higher standard of behavior than the average citizen because they are expert and have a greater understanding than the average person. Also, because of their more entitled status in society, they should be held to a higher than average standard of ethics because they have the means, resources, education and intelligence to be able to understand and act on an ethical system.<br /><br />3) When individuals took out faulty mortgages, their debts were never leveraged more than 1:1. When investment bankers traded in CDO's, they were leveraged as much as 50:1. This would be equivalent to me borrowing $50 million (from China) against my $1 million dollar house, going to Vegas, losing, then being bailed out by my town government because I was \"too big too fail.\" I would then take my bailout money and use it to buy up all my neighbor's houses, because some of them had defaulted on bad mortgages, or their banks had jacked interest rates on what had been fairly reasonable mortgages to pay for some of the 1:1 defaults, but even more, to pay for my toxic 50:1 debt.<br /><br />And some of you are shocked, shocked!, that people are so angry at the investment bankers. If you're an investment banker, and your friends are investment bankers, and your friend's friends are investment bankers, I suggest you may have a skewed perspective.

In its trading unit of 2010, Goldman seems more akin to a shady racetrack tout.  If nothing else, Congress should ban naked credit default swaps and synthetic CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), which are nothing but elaborate bets on economic activity taking place elsewhere.  If American consumers are now wondering why financial institutions have nothing to lend small and large businesses, homebuyers and ordinary families, it is largely because the credit markets are tapped out as a result of gambling with borrowed money.  The gaming industry created by synthetic CDOs and naked CDS made the financial crisis worse than it otherwise would have been by creating a betting parlor for dubious deals.  I'm ready to see the capital markets get back to the business of raising money for  real economic activity that would create products, services nd jobs.  I hope that Congress sees it the same way and bans naked CDS and synthetic CDOs, while increasing capital reserve requirements.<br /><br />As for Goldman's dual roles as an advisor and a market maker: this is standard operating procedure, but another possibility is separating these functions into separate entities and regulating both activities more stringently.

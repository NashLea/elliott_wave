How is the intentional touch with the foot different than a single dribble. I think that Hansson was unreasonably swayed both by the Porto player jumping up and down with his hands in the air AND by Campbell's guilty reaction.

Do you think maybe the people who design the courses should anticipate that, and not create a course which has a ravine two feet from the edge of the course right after a sharp turn?<br /><br />Yes, in either the States or Canada, were Ms. Madjic to sue, she would find the doctrine of assumption of the risk -- or \"no duty of care\" -- a significant obstacle to winning the negligence lawsuit.   However, many courts rule that the organizers of or participants in a sporting event DO have a duty to not cause harm to participants through their recklessness or gross negligence.   Having seen the complete lack of any barriers by the side of the course where the ravine lurked so closely, I suspect Ms. Madjic would have a decent chance of convincing a court that the course creators were grossly negligent.  Nevertheless, she still probably has the large problem that her damages won't be large enough to make it worth a lawyer's while to take the case and spend the considerable amount of time it will undoubtedly take to win it.<br />Besides, running four races in a few hours, against the best skiers in the world, and coming away with a bronze, all the while operating with four cracked ribs and a collapsed lung, has made Ms. Madjic an international hero.

My top ten finish from yesterday should have an asterisk by it, since it seems most of the top solvers were too busy traveling to Brooklyn to bother doing the puzzle.  Guess I better get some sleep if I'm going to make the 9:30 a.m. registration!<br /><br />Beautiful Entries:  crossing central entries, bien sur, plus PART-TIME, ONE-ARMED* (two of my favorite tasteless trivia questions:  \"How many arms are there in Def Leppard?\" [9] and \"How many testicles were in the starting lineup of the 1994 Philadelphia Phillies?\" [17]), SOLAR CELLS, ROAD TO RUIN, GRAZIOSO, MARMOT, EPILOGUE, NEEDLING, IN-STATE<br /><br />Clever Clues:  \"Like many student jobs,\" \"Note from one who's shy,\" \"Exposure warning?\"* \"Catchy thing?\" \"I.M. not sent through AOL?\" (by far my personal favorite!), \"Person making a check mark?\"<br /><br />Misdirection:  thinking Citi Field not Madison Avenue for \"Pitcher,\" topiary not hair styles for \"bushes,\" thermodynamics not weaponry for \"Heat,\" muscles not psyche for \"soreness,\" human not guitar for \"Neck,\" criminology not dermatology for \"Breakouts,\" courthouse not schoolhouse for \"class action,\" first name not last for \"James\" (WORTHY would've fit, but LEBRON is more relevant)<br /><br />Errors:  ENDORSER for ENDORSEE, IDEALISM for IDEALITY<br /><br />New Words:  Ran-tan, TIMBAL (was trying to make TIMPANUM fit), chthonic*, AGRObiology<br /><br />New Facts About Old Words:  Richard III quote, the Indian COBRA's genus and species (not quite as fun as Gorilla gorilla), MANILA's nickname<br /><br />Wikipedia Worthy:  KAZ(uo) MATSUI*, T(homas) S(tearns) Eliot (whose full name I had the pleasure of giving as a correct answer on JEOPARDY!), I(eoh) M(ing) Pei, STARA Zagora, USAIN BOLT* (was trying to make it a team once the first three letters turned out to be U.S.A.!), Cesare BORGIA, EMERIL Lagasse (from Fall River, MA, just like Lizzie Borden!), UNDERDOG, IRINA Spalko<br /><br />Crosswordese:  DAIL (2), one of the crossword puzzle's least favorite foreign legislatures, not as popular as the KNESSET (7) or DUMA (12) and appearing for the first time in 15 years, though I was shocked neither ALTHING nor STORTING has appeared during the Will Shortz era;

It's the whole program, with many variables, not a single element.  Read the rules.  The scoring system didn't overly reward him for the thing he does very well-- jumping--and yet still held him accountable for the things he doesn't do as well.  It was balanced, a whole package score.  And his whole package score simply wasn't as good.  The guy did an old school program, if he wants to place blame, he needs to look to his coach who apparently hasn\u2019t been paying attention to how the sport has evolved.<br /><br /> While it\u2019s a new scoring system, it\u2019s not like it was new for Vancouver.  It\u2019s been in place for six years. Where have he and his coach been?   He didn\u2019t have any problem with the \"new\" scoring system when he won in 2006 or his competitions this year.

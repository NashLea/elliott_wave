Where I grew up, our cats roamed free, and brought in 50 rats for every bird  they caught.  As often as not, we could intervene and save the bird (the cats were so proud of these rare avian catches, they often brought them home unharmed), but we were glad to see the rats go.  Rats are also omnivores and amazing tree-climbers.  The 50 rats, loose but for our cats, would have killed far more than one bird.<br/><br/>Wherever people go without cats, rats run free and multiply.  Several readers have mentioned Europe's experiment eliminating those 'satanic' cats, and the deadly plague that followed.  When I worked in Boston's Chinatown, it was largely free of roaming cats, but chock-full of rats.  I would often see rivers of rats pouring from trash cans when my car headlights shined on them at night.<br/><br/>Poison the rats instead of using cats?  Not nearly as effective, because the rats must first find and eat the poison, with plenty of other food sources around.  Cats, on the other hand, can stalk and catch rats hundreds of feet away.  Poisons also indiscriminately kill hawks, ospreys, snakes, and other animals that naturally hunt rodents.<br/><br/>There are excellent, life-saving reasons why humans have lived with outdoor cats for thousands of years.

It is of course often far different for cats that live in urban environments, but the cats that live in urban environments are not creating the problems associated with wildlife predation.<br/><br/> One of our cats, and I use the term 'our' loosely because she lived on her own, in a barn, with very little support from humans. She was a friendly female, who could be petted and picked up by someone familiar, but she chose to live independently, separate from the other cats who largely relied on us for their survival on the farm. She lived exclusively by hunting, except during the harshest winters. She understood instinctively there were already too many cats in that area, so she abandoned her litters of kittens in open fields soon after birth. One of which I found in a soybean field and raised as a house pet, but he also had a fiercely independent streak, disappearing for days or weeks at a time, roaming the area looking for females on other Farms. <br/><br/> His mother of which I speak lived for over 25 years, whereas our average indoor outdoor house cats on the farm lived for 15 to 18 years at best. But as any human will tell you, quality of life is far more important than quantity.  Any cat given the choice, chooses freedom over captivity.

That is much different than a trap-neuter-return colony. I have had many cats over the years and some are not suited to be indoors fulltime. Many of those cats have been virtually non-hunters or poor hunters. And no doubt, many bird enthusiasts would be happy to have cats kill non-native bird species because they have stated they \"hate\" them.<br/>\nCertainly, in areas where endangered species of birds or other critters are more common, it would be best to not have domesticated cats roaming about there, but that is just not the case for most indoor-outdoor pet cats or TNR colonies. There are differences between truly feral cats, TNR colonies, and parttime outdoor cats.  And a well-fed cat that ages will not roam as much, hunt as much, or even go outside as much. It's the younger cats that do the most hunting &amp; spay/neuter would help reduce their numbers. The truly feral cats are often loners and become part of the food chain.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3357233, "replies": [], "lft": 60, "assetURL": "http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/should-you-buy-travel-insurance/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8180781, "rgt": 61, "userDisplayName": "Eleanor Flagler Hardy", "createDate": "1359522326", "userID": 58545078, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1359522375", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Louisville, KY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1359522375", "commentSequence": 17, "commentBody": "We always get travel insurance when we travel, and we recommend it to our travelers. At the very least, basic medical and evacuation insurance is a must, and it costs $58 if you're 60. It can cost $100,000 to be evacuated out of some of the places we go and send people: the middle of Siberia, the center of the African continent, the coast of Costa Rica. Who has that kind of money handy? And it has nothing to do with age. A young person can blow out a knee, as my husband did, on a trip to Prague. Our expenses were $8,000 -- all covered up front by our excellent travel insurance, Travelex. An older person might have to be evacuated from the Trans-Siberian Express, as we had to arrange. That was 10 years ago, and the cost was $75,000. The trick to travel insurance is to use a reliable company, such as Travelex, which we use personally and recommend to our travelers. Things to ask: does it cover pre-existing conditions? Does it cover all ages? Is it primary insurance? Does it have a human I or my loved ones can talk to in case of medical emergency to plot my evacuation? Is there a person I can call to buy it -- AND the same person to talk to if I have a claim and need back-up? Save yourself a lot of trouble.

Birds are being destroyed by pollution, herbicides, pesticides, habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, and global warming. All of the economic groups that bring these forces to bear on birds are extremely well defended by lobbyists. The anti-catters know perfectly well they can't win against Big Agriculture, Big Chemistry, an endless array of industrial polluters, and the development lobby.

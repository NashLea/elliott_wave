All the people have is, still, all we had when Bush was in the White House -- his word for it, the media's word for it. Tall tales than turn on lies, lies no one can verify or deny. Bush all over again! Only now even more than back then, the people WANT to believe what they're told--to judge by the comments and the euphoria. Shame, shame, shame! A nation that respects and honors itself does not indulge in the celebration of anyone's demise. Regardless of who or what Osama was, what he did or did not do, it would have served better the already sullied image of a nation's credibility to have treated this man's death with far greater dignity, transparency and respect. It is to the victor's honor to treat the vanquished, dead or alive, with the dignity, honor and transparent honesty due himself!\r<br/><br/>No, do not expect peace nor any manner of justice to come from actions such as this. The path of blood and violence only leads to more and more blood, greater and greater violence. This is not over yet, nor can it be for a time to come.

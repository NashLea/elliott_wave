And as it gradually dissipates, society slowly grows less efficient, less pleasant, less safe and more corrupt. A good illustration is traffic: as drivers generally become ruder, less attentive, less predictable, the roads become more dangerous and clogged. But it's not black &amp; white: there's always another place where drivers have even less trust. As bad as it gets, it can always get worse. Which, on the flip side, means that even when it's gotten pretty bad, there's still an amazing amount of trust. Being social animals, trust is our natural state. If there was literally no trust, no car could move even 1 block without a collision.

An extreme example is exhibited in the frustrations of my friend who teaches nursing who said that answers were coming out sometimes three decimal places wrong without the students having any idea that that could not be right.  Let us hope that in the real world, they would not give an entire shelf full of boxes of medication to one patient.

People are baffled when you give them some extra coins to make the change in a cash transaction come out conveniently.  Nursing students come into pharmacology class having no idea how a decimal point works and think it means remainder instead.  No wonder our hospitals are riddled with medical mistakes and people have no idea they can't really afford that McMansion.  Whoever decided that it was more important for students to know how to apply math than to come out with the right answer when calculating made a grave mistake.

It has become a fanatic anti-tax, anti-regulation, anti-government movement.  Republicanism is the antithesis of patriotism.  How can a person love their country when love of self dominates?  How can a person participate in a community when they refuse to make any sacrifice whatsoever to support that community?  How can a person be a citizen when they refuse to partake of the duties of citizenship?<br/><br/>The entire foundation of any human society, rests on social cooperation and participation of societal tasks.  This would  include things like obeying the law, and respect for rights of others.  In the world of the current GOP, these things are an anathema.  They get in the way of true freedom where people can do whatever they want.  No society could hold together under those conditions.  The GOP's push for guns everywhere, no taxes, no regulations of an kind, and ignoring federal law all point in this direction.<br/><br/>So keep talking Mr. Bundy.  Stop making hateful, racial comments because they detract from your true mission.  Selfishness.  You are no patriot.

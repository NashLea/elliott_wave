And I hope many people will drop their defensiveness and simply engage in a conversation about some of the questions that arise from this report. I've thought about a couple of points after reading the article and the comments.<br/>\nThere is a difference between being the biological parent of a child and an active caretaking parent. It seems that the bilogoical act of fathering a child or for the mother, birthing a child, isn't the factor that affects hormone levels, but the caretaking of the child. I've known women who have started affairs within months of giving birth - I'd say they weren't very good parents (speculating that having an affair means less time with the baby and less commitment to the baby's needs) and perhaps because they didn't attach to their child their hormone levels stayed high enough that seeking out further sexual interests was more attractive than caring for the child. I've known men to do the same thing - start up with another partner after the birth of a child. So maybe it's the bonding with and caring for the baby that reduces hormone levels and enhances actions of commitment. I think it's interesting that this could happen - a biological change that enhances likely survival of the newborn and supports the intellectual and emotional commitments people make when they become close enough that they can produce a baby. Its a biological event that can happen almost without your thinking about it - prior to this study letting you know that it's happening. This makes perfect evolutionary sense - if you want your 'genes' to survive and perhaps procreate in the future then the baby needs to survive. And if you want your personality, values and individual quirks to be carried on into the future then you need to interact with your child - to imprint some of who you are on that little baby.

Just finished watching the Republican debate (and then immediately made a donation to the Obama campaign). The opening of this \"debate\" reminded me of a game show introduction (cue: Merv Griffin). This is the best we've got on the opposition? All would repeal the Affordable Heatlh Care Act and go back to a system where a pre-existing condition could mean a death sentence. Unbelievable.  I felt sickened by the applause at the idea that people should turn to their church, instead of a health care system,  for monetary help when diagnosed with a life-threatening disease.  Who are these callous people who want to be President in 2012? Has anyone, among these candidates, ever had a family member who's been denied care because of a pre-existing condition? And they'd be okay to continue denying that care?  And Social Security? Oh, we'll pander to those who are of a certain age (we want  their votes) but younger folks, they should be able to opt out and save their own money for their retirement. Oh, because that's what they'll surely do. Invest wisely. And put it where? In the stock market?  Oh yes, that'll be  a sure thing.\r<br/><br/>I'm sticking with the pragmatic, thoughtful and intelligent man we already have in the White House, despite the criticism of the progressives who are SO disappointed with Mr. Obama, and the Republicans who have been so determined to make him a one-term president since Day One. And those progressives who might sit at home come November 2012 and not vote at all? Shame on you! Work harder to get the Democrats in the House, the Senate and the White House.

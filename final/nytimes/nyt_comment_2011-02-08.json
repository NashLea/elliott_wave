My husband has recently been diagnosed with Adult ADH.  He is very accomplished in his profession, and extremely driven in his work.  He's found a field in which ADHD, particularly the hyper-focus aspect of it, is an asset.  However, at home with his family his ADHD traits can make him quite difficult to live with.  I\"m left \"holding the bag\" with the mundane details of life - paying bills, filling cars with gas, arranging kid's schedules... all of that falls to me, as he forgets everything and doesn't pay attention to anything we discuss.  It's hard not to see this as a judgment about what is important to him - after all, he doesn't forget things at work! While I've worked hard to understand ADHD, and i certainly agree that it is a legitimate disorder and that my husband has suffered from it all of his life, as a spouse it is hard to manage.  It sometimes seems like there is a fine line between the disorder and simply being inconsiderate.  Is there any way to treat these issues successfully?  I need to know if there is some hope that these aspects of our relationship could change or improve over time.

We take him off of the medication on weekends and breaks from school to minimize the negative effects of the medication (appetite loss and sleep loss) - is this worthwhile? Or it it better for the child to have the consistency of being on the medication all the time.  3. Is there anything we can do to conteract the effects of the medication? 4. Does ADHD ever go away with time (for example does the medication help create new pathways in the brain to help correct the problem?). 5. What are the top things you would suggest to help a child with ADHD turn into a functioning adult? 6.

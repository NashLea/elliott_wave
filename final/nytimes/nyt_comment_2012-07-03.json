There are two cameras, one filming from across the inside lane and one filming from across the outside lane.

It's the inside image that shows the torsos flush with the line. Although he first ruled Tarmoh third, he almost immediately second guessed himself and called in four referees for a consultation.<br/><br/>If Tarmoh believes she was rightly the winner, she was only so provisionally and only for the time it took the judge to overrule himself.  I'm sensing that she's a vulnerable, inexperienced newcomer who has fallen back on her high school and college mentors because--as if things weren't complicated enough--she and Felix share a coach in Bobby Kersee who has been doing his best all week to avoid the conflict of interest of advising either runner what to do.  When pressed, he said \"It would be like your asking me which one of my kids I would let drown.\"<br/><br/>Neither Tarmoh, nor her chosen mentors, seem well enough versed in the \"thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\" nature of Olympic Trials competition.

But considering that, with all the heats and semis and finals that have been run at Olympic Trials over the years, this has never happened before, I would cut them a little slack.<br/><br/>It's the three slots only that complicates the situation here; if they'd tied for first or second the third place finisher would have been out of luck.  Presumably in open competition, they could have tied for the bronze, but the rules say only three can go to the Olympics.  This situation was made so much more complicated by the fact that both girls had both entered in two events and both had been warming up, running, and cooling down all week.  Ato Bolden for NBC was adamant that the issue should be settled by competitive means and not a coin toss, but that was easy for him to say, he was sitting in a booth on his fanny all week.  A high stakes runoff?  It's like asking them to just go out there and, why not?, tear a  hamstring for TV.<br/><br/>Your suggestion that the tiebreaker should be the runners' progression of times has merit.  During the rounds, advancing can depend either on placing or on the next fastest times, so the concept is already in place in track, it just needs to be formalized.  Pole vaulters and high jumpers are placed based both on final height and progressive misses.

It was another 24 hours before USATF proposed their coin flip or runoff alternatives to the two competitors.<br/><br/>Specific \"tiebreaker\" rules should be in place ahead of meets, instead of the ad hoc manner of this coin flip or runoff.

It would be rare indeed for the combined times from three or four races to be \"equal\" down to one-one thousandth of a second.

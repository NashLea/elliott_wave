I never worked so hard as as student or learned so much as a student than when I studied  at the Sorbonne-and I did it for next to no money when compared to college tuition in the U.S.  I am happy to see that the French are opening up an class based closed system at the top, but I would also love to see more discussion on the fact that students in the US are increasingly shut out by economics-and that the US has an elite based on money alone.  Culturally there is no comparison in the way the French value knowledge.  I became a fluent French speaker and student of French in part because in France being interested in books, eager to think, and to study the humanities was supported in an absolute manner.  I was always respected for my efforts.  I remember feeling so down when I was graded in the French manner 11 points out 20 on a test.  I went home to my French concierge, and when she saw the score, she congratulated me, saying that just to break 10 in the French system represents lots of work.  When I graduated from the the program, our whole class was treated to free coffee at a cafe, and we were publically congratulated by the proprietor, after a ceremony in which I was kissed on both cheeks and treated like royalty-simply for having been successul in a summer program at the Sorbonne.  People on the street would always compliment me, just on hearing I as a student studying French at the university level.  Contrast this attitude with what I have faced in an American context:   After getting an M.A. degree in European History, I could only get a teaching job if a coached a sport-often that was the first question at interviews.  I have been  told on more than one occasion that my interest in the humanities is less than useless.  My father was criticized for \"allowing\" me to study history by his colleagues at work-such it was not practical.  France and European school systems subsidize learning \"unpractical\" subjects, just as European health care is subsidized.  As a result, my intellectual development was valued in its own right.  This is a French strength, that goes beyond the problem of social mobility and class.  Right now the American system is being strangled by a strict markeplace definition of value-as a result of this definition-children are without insurance, and education is only valued as a means to getting job.  In France, all children are insured-and knowledge is of infinite value.  I just don't see why this European difference is so often ignored in these online debates comparing the U.S. to European countries.  When it comes to social security, and education, Europe is ahead, because its citizens accept that they must pay more taxes, that society is one unified whole, and that health and education are the most important investment a society can make in its citizens.

By all account the Iphone 4 has a major flaw. It's not very good as a phone.  It's has basically been relegated to Ipod touch status with some phone capabilities due to a verifiable antenna problem.  Now from that we can deduct,as logical people, that the phone that does not drop calls and is fast and powerful would be the \"best phone\" Not just the best Android Phone Mr. Rogue, but the best phone period.<br /><br />This is my opinion as an owner of 3 Iphones and 1 Ipod touch and many more mac products.

And on the palate it seemed to have a real tension, with a gamut of fruity, herbal, and woody flavors being tightly wound into a compact, elegant package. Hints of pepper and licorice were also detectable, though the finish was definitely more herbal, with a distinctly bitter quality. It also got funkier/gamier with time open,but on the second day, the wine declined precipitously. Fantastic the first night though. <br/><br/>The soup was not a terrible pairing, but not ideal. We gave it a chance. At the very least, the level of richness helped the soup to keep up, and the wine's fine-grained tannins and moderate acid provided contrast. However, it still felt like a bit of a clash, like switching between two different radio stations. The Gigondas frankly seemed to beg for something a bit more substantial. <br/><br/>But at any rate this seemed like a good choice for the first wine---it had a lot of really accessible qualities and made for easy, relaxed drinking.

Enjoyed it with stuffed porkchops and mushroom ravioli with cremini ragu.<br/><br/>This was (*is*...the last bit is getting swished around in my glass at the moment) a fantastic wine. It's a gorgeously deep ruby-garnet shade that catches light in a really pretty, flashy way. And it's got a really expressive aroma, loaded with kirsch liqueur and framboise, with notes of cedar, sandalwood, menthol, and fresh game. Very full bodied on the palate, with firm tannins and a ton of cherry/blackberry fruit. But it also has a lot of complexity that isn't fruit-driven. While lacking the minerality of the Pallieres, it does have noticeable herb and licorice flavors, and hints of baking cocoa emerge after a few hours. Moderately long, gripping finish. We love it.<br/><br/>The wine had a distinctly earthy, woody quality that went well with the mushroom side dish in particular. The bit of fat on the pork chop helped to compensate for the wine's drying tannins, and generally, nothing got in the way. Very nice pairing.<br/><br/>Overall, this was our favorite. Stylistically, it had a lot in common with the Cayron (though generally better to our taste in every way), and perfectly mature. But even the Pallieres seemed to fit in even if it had a harder edge. Lots of woodiness, lots of tart berry, and herbal notes. Like many of the other classes, \"variations on a theme\" seems to fit the bill.

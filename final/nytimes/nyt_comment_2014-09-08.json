It\u2019s safer than driving after taking a hit of crack, but driving stoned is driving impaired, and the amount of impairment will vary with age, dose, and a host of other variables. The problem is the potency of mj has steadily increased (with new delivery systems further ramping  up the effects). So have documented accidents involving stoned drivers. A study of 3,000 fatalities in Australia showed that a driver was more likely to be at fault when THC was present in the blood of the driver. And the higher the THC, the greater the likelihood of culpability.<br/>There are substantial risks to the heavy user, starting with impaired coordination, rapid pulse, damage to lungs and increases in respiratory illness. I'm not even going to mention adverse fetal effects and loss of IQ points in habitual users. Both physical and psychological addiction occur.  Long-term use results in tolerance to THC and withdrawal symptoms when a user tries to stop.<br/>But it\u2019s the liabilities to the innocent bystanders that concern me, the danger to the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians who are at greater risk from stoned drivers. Maybe a little mj makes drivers more cautious, but very stoned drivers can't stay in lanes and don't care. If states are going to legalize (decreasing incarceration costs and increasing incomes via taxes), at least they should set DWI limits low and enforce them. It\u2019s the right thing to do.

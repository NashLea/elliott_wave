As jburnich commented, the \"easy oil\" is declining in availability.  Many of the newer wells have an uplift cost well in excess of what the costs were in the 1990s.  If the price continues to drop, the more costly wells will be capped.  Uplift costs in Saudi Arabia average around $10, so it is to the Saudi's benefit to keep producing as that helps its national budget (but the benefit is far less than before due the price decline).<br/><br/>The high cost of crude in 2008 was caused in part by \"paper oil,\" traders who neither produced nor consumed crude and were purely speculators.  Changes in regulation and exchange rules have greatly reduced the level of paper oil traded.  That is one, but not the only, reason for the decline in the price of oil.  A major factor today, as noted by others here, is a significant and continuing excess of crude production over consumption.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3445857, "replies": [], "lft": 695, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/flint-michigan-lead-water-crisis.html", "parentID": 17286760, "commentID": 17287238, "rgt": 696, "userDisplayName": "cl", "createDate": "1453349344", "userID": 32399637, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1453352419", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "vermont", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1453352419", "commentSequence": 17287238, "commentBody": "No. The state was in control and the state made the decision.", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 3445857, "replies": [], "lft": 697, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/flint-michigan-lead-water-crisis.html", "parentID": 17286760, "commentID": 17287241, "rgt": 698, "userDisplayName": "Dracula", "createDate": "1453349381", "userID": 69526895, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1453352419", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Uruguay", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1453352419", "commentSequence": 17287241, "commentBody": "Basically the Republicans want the EPA out, federal government out, Obama overreach out, because they trust their state legislators and governor.

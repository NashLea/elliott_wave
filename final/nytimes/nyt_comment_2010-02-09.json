The story and the comments here relate to a Republican congressman who has unwisely blockaded your president's appointments (you are a patriot, right?), including several for leadership in departments of your military and your defense organizations, on which your country's safety depend.  Once it came out that this congressman was doing this not for the general good of your country, but for contracts that benefit corporations in his state (i.e., corporations who finance his campaigns), he backtracked to avoid embarrassment and further damage to his party's reputation as the do-nothing, know-nothing earmarketeers.<br /><br />Beyond this, has anyone noticed the increase of boilerplate, Karl-Rove-generated comments like Augustine's in the so called MSLM?   No matter what the topic, just simplify and repeat.   Less taxes, small government, more freedom.  Never mind what's best or optimum.  The dark art of propaganda is getting a grip on the throat of rational public policy discourse.<br /><br />To counter, here are a few talking points of my own:  As I see it, it's not about big government vs. freedom.  It's about working towards BETTER government.  The best possible government.   If your streets aren't being paved or planes are crashing, you might want more government.   If you're losing freedom or paying to much in tax, for no good reason and you might want less.   Bad government is bad.  But good government is good.  But less is not always more!

Andriy, even in his rather broken English, delivered us more on the country: that the country is closely divided in two halves, that the western Ukrainians treat their eastern compatriots with much distaste and I am sure the feeling is mutual. Also, that many of the developing country nationalists-\"democrats\" like play on our pathological fear of Russia, and manage to milk us for quite a few bucks which, if we hadn't been so stupid, we would keep for ourselves. Being played by Georgian,Polish, Baltic, Ukrainian and other nationalists in the vicinity of Russia only made us continue looking at Russia through the Cold War tank goggles.

Soviets, including Ukrainians, lost the Cold War but we're still loosing it to none other than our military-industial-politico-corporate complex. The complex plays with our childish notions of military might and world pre-eminence. But we can't ever be the winners when we spend about a trillion dollars a year on this madness! Enough!<br /><br />Finally, having lived in Canadian Quebec and having been to similarly divided Belgium and Italy, I foresee political instability for Ukraine for decades to come, since the Western Ukrainians won't melt into the Eastern Ukrainians and vice versa for very l;ong time.

Why does matter have inertia? Does gravity really travel at the speed of light or is it instantaneous? Someone also once said about quantum superposition \"when I hear of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, I reach for my gun\". Theoretical physics has lost its way it appears; it's no longer a science but a cult religion?<br /><br />At least Einstien's gravity was provable, a practical experiment during an eclipse proved it to bend light. Einstein pretty much said gravity wasn't a force but the curvature of the space-time that permeates the universe. Newton's equations approximate how the curvature behaves. Einstein thought he re-introduced the \"ether\" in a way, that mystical medium that light traveled through as a wave. We all know to Einstein and other scientists that light and everything pretty much is both a wave and particular.  How does gravity increase entropy if it squeezes particles down into generic one square Planck-sized units at a black hole? Isn't that an ultimate ordering of things at a singularity? Gravity would only want to increase entropy if it were stronger at the edges of the universe which it probably is, as the \"expanding edges\" of the universe is the boundary of a singularity? The universe might be being pulled apart from the outside by gravity?  If one looks back in time as they peer out toward the edges of the universe are they not really peering back into the singularity, why it appears so similar in all directions, and why the expansion rate of the universe might seem to be increasing as we peer backward in time? We do know time doesn't exist for electromagnetic radiation and elementary particles? Space isn't really space at all but a seething vacuum of virtual particles that pop into and out of existence so quickly that they disappear before they exist? The universe itself might just be but one vacuum fluctuation out of an infinite number of others?<br /><br />Many of the above ideas arise from theoretical physics.

If one could easily look up a license plate and connect it to a person, don't you think 'hand gestures' and more egregious 'private enforcement' behaviors (like slamming on one's brakes, swerving into a lane, etc.) would be greatly diminished?  I'm not suggesting that, of course, because then we'd have even more serious altercations at people's homes.

I often respond in kind, because it bothers me when I see something that is open to such a wide audience (essentially the world), that is racist, sexist, 'religion-ist,' not factual, etc.  Someone posted above about the correlation between the inept grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. and the usually bankrupt content of the post.  I too have found that correlation, and often use that as the starting point to raking the poster over the coals.

Just today, Tennessee legislators began considering a bill that would require kindergarten entrants to take a maturity test. I guess, instead of cutting an already bare bones budget, they've opted to just cut the kids out. Kids need to be engaged, given tools for critical thought and nourished intellectually. Actual food would be good too. All too many kids are hungry, even in areas where hunger wasn't a problem before the recession. We already know that a hungry child doesn't learn well. The right wing is even opposed to feeding kids in school. As for education, the things that fuel a child's imagination and thirst for knowledge are being cut right and left, with arts and other programs being discontinued and hours of instruction cut. What our kids are being taught is often decided by politicians and business people who have some interest to fulfill. It's a crying shame.<br/><br/>We have a National Academy of Science. We have some great universities.

In past generations, the average person didn't even read this stuff--now it's all consuming. I guess it's had some good effect giving basic common sense advice.

I joined the investment club at work, I studied the market and how it works, and I put the full amount into the 401K at the time. <br/><br/>In the meantime the company no longer offered defined benefit plans to the new hires.

If you retire at 65 and live to 85, you can only take out $12.5K a year for 20 years. If you get $1600 SS after your medicare payments, that only gives you $31,700 a year income. If you are a good investor, you can get 5% on overage in dividends and interest. That is only $1250 a year in income.  <br/><br/>The other big mistake  people made in 2008 was to sell. They looked at their accounts and it looked like they were losing money. You do not lose until you sell and if you have good investments, the income continues.

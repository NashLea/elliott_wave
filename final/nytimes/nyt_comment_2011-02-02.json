Thousands of illegal migrants from Central America (I believe 3,000 is the latest number) have disappeared in the last two years after crossing the border, may are feared dead, like the 45 that were found executed last year. Mass grave discoveries are a common occurrence today as are decapitated, mutilated, tortured cadavers, some hung from bridges in Cuernavaca, Acapulco, Monterrey. Many thousands of unsolved murders. Many unreported kidnappings, disappearances, extortions.<br /><br />These bandidos roam around in caravans of SUV\u2019s, in groups of twenty to fifty, all armed with submachine guns, mostly AR-15\u2019s and Ak-47\u2019s and some grenades and rocket propelled grenades. These weapons are mostly bought legally in Texas and Arizona and smuggled into Mexico. They have lots of cash, military training (lots of military deserters), unlimited cellphones, radios, police and military uniforms. Some are known to US Army trainers, for they were part of the Special Forces (GAFES) contingent trained by them.<br /><br />Please help us, don\u2019t let any more weapons cross the border, we implore you, these weapons might be for sport in the US but they are used for barbarous crimes in Mexico.  I can\u2019t believe Hillary Clinton said last week in Guanajuato that the conflict was going according to expectations and that there were no alternatives but the disaster that is going on now. During her quick visit students there marched in protest of the weapons trade from the US asking it to stop but that did not get reported, not even by the NY Times, check the Mexican media reports from that day.<br /><br />The three pillars of the New Crime Syndicate of Mexico: Money, Weapons, Drugs.<br /><br />Money: $30 billion dollars a year, yes, billion with a b, get \u201claundered\u201d through Mexico from the US. Interdict and confiscate this fortune and you will go far in killing this monster.<br /><br />Weapons: Estimated at 95,000 assault weapons and pistols exported from the US to Mexico every year, especially since 2004 when the Assault Weapons Ban was repealed by President Bush.<br /><br />Narcotics: At this point the drugs are the least of the problems Mexico has. Perhaps Mexico should just legalize them and let the Border Patrol deal with the problem, since trying to stop the traffic through the country has caused such destruction and mayhem.<br /><br />By the way, the Merida Initiative has not worked. Things have only gotten worse, much worse since it came on the table. Try something different, soon.<br />", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 2363220, "replies": [], "lft": 756, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02egypt.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3325518, "rgt": 757, "userDisplayName": "Rajesh", "createDate": "1296612567", "userID": 34933089, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296623576", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "delhi, India", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296623576", "commentSequence": 335, "commentBody": "it is comical to see all the idealistic, ignorant Americans talk  about democracy in the Middle East. lets contrast this  with Arab and Muslim reality. iran and iraq have driven their minority populations away or killed them, whether they are christians or shiite or sunni or ahmediya.<br /><br />the iranian uprising resulted in the regime tightening their grip and becoming more repressive. have you heard anything from moussavi lately?<br /><br />you can expect expect tunisia and egypt to go the way of new repressive regimes which replace the old repressive regimes. much against the best wishes of the majority of the iranian, tunisian and egyptian people who just want a better life.<br /><br />that is unfortunately the reality of any islamic country.<br /><br />yes prez obama has a big dilemma on his hands - repressive mubarak regime or repressive muslim brotherhood regime that could unravel middle eastern peace.<br /><br />for those of you who think that is not important or that oil is not important, remmber that this very same oil you express a disdain for is probably powering the laptop that lets you read this and post rebuttals.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2365175, "replies": [], "lft": 80, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/americas/02mexico.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3325521, "rgt": 81, "userDisplayName": "tolle141", "createDate": "1296612692", "userID": 62168479, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296623576", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Minnesota", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296652667", "commentSequence": 36, "commentBody": "Strictly controlling gun ownership in the US will only result in the Cartels going somewhere else to buy guns...  and restricting guns is a sensitive subject because people wish to hunt, shoot, and defend themselves if needed.

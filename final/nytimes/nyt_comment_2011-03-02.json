Odd that NYRB mgmt including Backe have praised Richie so often and extended his contract last year, but now fire him during critical period before season? Richie is known for good chemistry with players and strong views on the game - maybe these became a threat to Backe if his own player rapport is weak? (rumors from last year). Why not Backe bring in his own boys from norway or wherever...problem is they, like him, have minimal experience in this league and with such a diverse group of players.

For some shops this may be true, but for companies really pushing the envelope of Direct Trade that's not true.<br /><br />For example if you look at the following document <a href=\"http://counterculturecoffee.com/docs/CCDTC_Annual_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://counterculturecoffee.com...</a> this outlines all the direct trade purchases that Counter Culture Coffee made and the price they paid for them. The coffee here that they purchased for $1.85 sold for $10.85. The thing to keep in mind is that that $1.85 went directly to the farmer not the a broker who then paid the farmer less. Counter Culture then has to add shipping, roasting costs and packaging costs to that $1.85 which probably brings the cost of that bag of coffee to $6.00 or so.

So far, the joke has proven true.<br /><br />Looking at how governments change, protests that topple leaders are often led by a large, youthful, disaffected, broad middle class movements that embrace a principled idealism. This was certainly true in 1776; many of the leaders of the American Revolution were young, born into families of land owners or other means, and educated and sought to achieve a society of high ideals. This was true in China's Long March, in Ghana's use of trade union strikes in Africa in 1956, in Cuba (Fidel was first a student leader, the son of a self-made farmer); in Barack Obama's election, and now across the region in the North African-Arabian peninsula. Despite ideological differences, the formula for change often mixes differing protions of the same components. Americans dread looking at these similarities across ideologies, since often we like to sort things into good and bad, and ignore nuances and complications, while fixating on lesser threats. It is strange to hear ordinary citizens of Arab countries, speaking impeccable English, nightly reassuring and telling Americans the rise of Islamism is not something to worry about.<br /><br />By ignoring the complexities of policy, or overlooking how democracy has becoming the crowning political creed of the times (as socialism once was in the mid 20th century), the administration can potentially undo many of the gains advanced by the people. Technical assistance and humanitarian aid is essential to retaining good will and a rapport with the new governments of the region. Planes with food and medical supplies should be landing now in Egypt and Tunisia. That alone would prove America's commitment to the new political landscape and send the proper signal to governments and citizens alike.<br /><br />I, however, fear the \u201cthings left undone.\u201d It would change the dynamics of world history if democracy in the region was still born, deprived of life support by the world's richest nation and greatest democracy. It would also be nice if elected officials at home would begin to appreciate the importance of listening to citizens and crafting effective compromises rather than implementing and perpetuating the rapidly abandoned politics of command and control.<br />--Walter Rhett<br /><a href=\"http://twitter.com/walterrhett\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/walterrhett</a>", "recommendationCount": 376}, {"assetID": 2467253, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/opinion/02friedman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3461198, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Sherif", "createDate": "1299038710", "userID": 23608509, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299048819", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299048819", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Mr. Friedman<br /><br />Do you feel that Americans owe Egyptians a big apology for backing dictators and tyrants who destroyed the dreams of their own people so that people such as yourself can drive a car and only have to worry that gas prices have reached only $3 per gallon?<br />Or do you feel like the US government's hands are clean of the \"pro-western\" autocrats and torturers?", "recommendationCount": 442}, {"assetID": 2467253, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/opinion/02friedman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3461222, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "JLT", "createDate": "1299039401", "userID": 2182617, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299048819", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Palo Alto, California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303220989", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Tom Friedman somehow forgot the effect of Iraq being the only Arab democracy in the Middle East.

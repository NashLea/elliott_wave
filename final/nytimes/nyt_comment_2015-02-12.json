But their star is Rachel Maddow.  Maybe let the two of them report the news, with Ms Maddow explaining (in plain language with lots of repetition--her hallmark) what's actually going on.  You might say this would have a feminist bias, but that's ok.  Women, especially single women with children, are in the upper echelons of the down-trodden regularly targeted by Republicans in their relentless policy of punishment for the poor.  Note that the Bush policy of \"give it all to the rich\" (many of whom are white supremacists) still endures, with newly won Obama healthcare and immigration reforms notable exceptions.  And these, they are fighting fiercely in order to prevent further reforms, such as single payer, more progressive taxation (or just a fair share corporate tax), or a carbon tax to realistically address global warming, which is caused by humans from burning fossil fuels.  My point here: To get this across, in the face of relentless lies from corporate propagandists, it will take a heap of explaining to do--hence Rachel Maddow.  Balanced coverage refers to liberal and conservative policy perspectives, not to a choice between lies and the truth, which is what we have now.<br/><br/>On Mr. Williams:  helicopters in his convoy(s) were fired at.

To investigate public perceptions of energy, we compare people\u2019s responses to questions about specific activities and behaviors with the best available data about actual energy use for those behaviors.<br /><br />Several people commented on the comparison of central air conditioning with an individual room air conditioner. Our survey results suggest that people underestimate the relative difference between energy used by central AC and energy used by room AC in one hour. When a decision about air conditioning is to be made, we believe people should be informed about the actual energy use for the specific scenario being considered. In some homes and locations, using an individual room air conditioner makes more sense than central air conditioning, while in other cases the reverse is true.<br /><br />There were many comments about bicycling compared with driving an energy efficient car. Of course riding a bicycle or walking uses less energy than driving any powered vehicle. It is great that people consider curtailing their energy use by turning off the lights and bicycling to work. Our point regarding curtailment and efficiency was a general one; we did not intended to imply that all efficiency-related behaviors are superior to all curtailment behaviors. However, curtailing behaviors may be difficult to maintain over a long period of time to actually realize a decrease energy use. Thus, we feel it is important for people to understand the impact of both curtailment AND increasing efficiency through new technologies. We are not advocating any particular behavior, but rather advocating better understanding of the actual energy used by various devices and technologies.<br /><br />There were several comments related to the life-cycle energy of appliances, including extraction of raw materials, manufacturing, use and disposal, not just the use phase.  We agree that life-cycle issues are very important, but we did not assess perceptions of life-cycle costs in this survey. Both the \"perceived\" energy use and the \"actual\" energy use would be much harder to assess if the full life cycle were considered.<br /><br />Some people questioned whether the energy saved by reducing the water temperature in washing machines is actually greater than the energy saved by drying clothes on the line. Our survey question described a specific scenario, namely changing washer temperature settings from \u201chot wash, warm rinse\u201d to \u201cwarm wash, cold rinse\u201d. We used published values for the average amount of water used and estimated temperatures of hot, warm, and cold water to calculate energy saved of around 4 kwh. A typical dryer with one load of laundry uses around 3.4 kwh. One reason for the difference is that it takes a lot of energy to heat a given quantity of water, more than heating air to evaporate water from clothing. (We caution that some energy figures for washers may not include the energy used to heat the water, which is most of the energy used in washing clothes.)  Of course, we agree with the many comments suggesting that it is best to do both \u2013 reducing washing machine temperatures AND line drying our clothes.<br /><br />A few comments pointed out that an improvement in energy efficiency in an appliance or a vehicle can result in the appliance being used more, or the vehicle being driven more. This \u201crebound\u201d effect, as it is called, is indeed a potential problem that can erode some of the benefit of a higher efficiency. The severity of the rebound effect can vary, depending on the specific circumstances of each situation. However, this does not mean that higher efficiencies are to be avoided -- rather it is an indication that we should be aware of this potential problem and take steps such as providing education and incentives to reduce the effect.<br /><br />Finally, a few comments asked for suggestions on what to do to save energy. We did not include such a list in our paper because our purpose was focused on assessing people\u2019s understanding of energy use. However, we can refer readers to an article by Thomas Dietz and others entitled \u201cHousehold Action Can Provide a Behavioral Wedge to Rapidly Reduce U.S. Carbon Emissions,\u201d available online at: <a href=\"http://behavioralwedge.msu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">behavioralwedge.msu.edu</a>. We agree with the many comments noting that savings add up when small energy-saving behaviors are performed consistently and by many people, but we also suggest that savings might accumulate more quickly if people (ourselves included) had a better understanding of the full spectrum of possibilities.<br /><br />We thank readers for their comments and hope this posting reduces any misunderstandings or confusion about our article.<br /><br />Shahzeen Attari, Michael DeKay, Cliff Davidson, Wandi Bruine de Bruin<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1781736, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 2444974, "replies": [], "commentID": 2445091, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Andy Revkin", "createDate": "1282710454", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282710454", "userTitle": "Dot Earth blogger", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "W in the Middle", "userURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com", "userLocation": "", "depth": 1, "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1282706854", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I urged readers to click on the link and read the full interview.

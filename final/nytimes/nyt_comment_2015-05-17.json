That's unfortunate. Despite riding big scary bicycles, the majority of us aren't aggressive (I mean we're a bunch of dorks riding bikes in the woods- it's not like we're doing something cool like playing football, shooting stuff, or beating back unruly hoards with ice picks). <br/><br/>If there's a rider out there that's a jerk, they're certainly also a jerk off their bike. Choosing to ride a bike doesn't make a person rude, and being rude doesn't make a person choose to get on a bike. People are what they are. Bummer that you've run into some bad ones.<br/><br/>It sounds like no one here is familiar with backcountry riding. Loaded with camping gear, I'm lucky if I can average 5mph on a trail. I'm not ripping, shredding, or scorching the earth (it sounds like some of you might have mountain biking confused with strip mining and mountain top removal). I stop and talk if I see a hiker- after all, we have a lot in common.<br/><br/>I like being in the backcountry, I like riding my bike. Other people like to walk. My way isn't better, it's just what makes me happy. I wish that some very vocal hikers could be ok with that, instead of trying to legislate a perfectly legitimate way of travel out of existence. <br/><br/>And I'd love to see some citations for the damage that tires cause compared to boots and hooves.

It is not an outdated policy.  My wife and I have hiked hundreds of miles in the past few years, so have seen this issue up close.<br/><br/>Of course many cyclists are considerate.  We, in fact, are also cyclists--road cyclists averaging about 2000 miles/year.<br/><br/>However, cyclists and hikers do not mix well on trails.  Although a minority, some cyclist do barrel down the trails so fast that as a hiker you have to be constantly \"on guard,\" which obliterates the hiking experience.  Although cyclists are supposed to give the right of way to hikers, in practical terms this isn't true.  Each time a cyclist and a hiker meet it is the hiker who has to step off of the trail.<br/><br/>Having said that, we are in favor of bikers and hikers working together to solve some of these issues.  We all have common interests that make it to our mutual benefit to work these issues out so we can all find ways of enjoying the outdoors together.  But my point is that it is more of a problem for hikers than you seem to be making it out to be.

Forest Service headquarters in Washington apparently took no interest. So, in 1988, three local Forest Service managers were talked into issuing their own closure directive. In a likely violation of federal law, no public notice or opportunity for comment was issued.<br/><br/>The directive has lingered ever since, through a combination of government inertia and people who think 100% access for them and 0% for mountain bikers is fine, as opposed to allowing bicycle access on certain days or times of the year.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to see what a court challenge to the directive would produce. My guess is that it would be invalidated. But why not just rescind it, when we know so much about managing bicycles on trails, something that was a mystery in 1988?<br/><br/>The bicycle ban is a foolish policy. Half or more of the PCT is not well-maintained; parts of it are disappearing and the land is returning to its natural state. Mountain bikers would provide a lot of maintenance help.<br/><br/>For more information, see the website of the Pacific Crest Trail Reassessment Initiative, <a href=\"http://www.SharingThePCT.org\" title=\"www.SharingThePCT.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.SharingThePCT.org</a>.

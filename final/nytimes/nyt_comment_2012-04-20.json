All the girls there work for the Colombian mafia. They will not be allowed into any clubs where they can meet tourists unless they pay what is basically a pimp. Competition is severe between the girls. They would be afraid to go in any club without their pimp's protection. The other girls will kill or beat them until no guy would want to look at them. Colombia has no food stamps or welfare system. The girls usually have a child and a mother they are supporting. When they leave a club with a guy, they owe their pimp an agreed amount, and they keep the rest.<br/><br/>When this Secret Service agent would not pay the girl, he was very likely taking the food out of her family's mouths and putting her at risk of getting killed or beat to hell by the pimp.

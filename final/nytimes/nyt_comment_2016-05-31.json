Chinese manufacturers can sell whatever they want in the free market. They set up a paper trail that is so convoluted that, when something goes wrong, the manufacturers can't be tracked down. As a result, the manufacturers have no financial incentive to follow standard safety procedures, and people have died as a result of improperly prepared Chinese heparin. <br/><br/>Or for a closer example, compounding pharmacies in the US are not regulated by the federal government, and after cutbacks in funding for state health departments, they're not regulated by the states either.

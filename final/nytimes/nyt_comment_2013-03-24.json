One of those barriers exists between the subjective experiences we enjoy and their causality.

It is beyond the epistemic limitations of science to prove such causality, and the familiar zombie-thought experiment illustrates this. Causality is extraordinarily hard to demonstrate rigorously, and in this case even if it's true it's probably impossible to prove. Is there ever inner life where the outward signs of it are absent?

All the Democratic candidates have to do is tell the truth, a refreshing &amp; novel idea in itself. The reason Democrats haven't done enough to create jobs &amp; improve the economy, Democrats must tell voters, is that Republicans held them back.<br /><br />Not a single Republican House member voted for the Recovery Act. Only three Republican Senators (one of whom is now a Democrat) voted for the Act, &amp; two of them devoted their energies to watering down the bill. The Recovery Act saved thousands of jobs, especially for public workers, like teachers. It kept states from going under. Republicans repeatedly voted against extension of unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed. Republican Senators used every tactic in their rules book to put the kibosh on even minor bills to further stimulate the economy &amp; create jobs. They opposed helping out the big auto makers, a program that turned out to be a great success &amp; saved thousands of American jobs.<br /><br />Republicans' only economic passion seems to be for tax cuts for the rich -- a \"stimulus\" program that won't create any more jobs, except perhaps for a few more gardeners &amp; maids who might find employment on landed estates.<br /><br />So unless millions of out-of-work or fearful voters aspire to becoming serfs for the rich, they would do well to vote Democratic.

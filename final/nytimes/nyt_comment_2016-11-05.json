That doesn't mean they should be president.<br/><br/>Then there is the rehash of trickle down economics.  Mr. Trump, why don't you propose that people that make over one million pay no taxes?  Then there will be even more money that trickles down into the pockets of working class people.  If a little trickling is good, why isn't a flood of trickling better?  Do the same for the big corporations.  Eliminate taxes on only the SP500 companies.  I'm sure none of that money will bypass the workers and go to the shareholders.  Don't bother with the small companies.  Not enough money there to trickle down.   <br/><br/>So Trump, don't hold back.  Go all the way.  We need more trickling.  It's worked so well so far, that it has created millions of struggling, disenfranchised voters who flock to you for more of the same.  Tell them that we just need more time and more trickling.

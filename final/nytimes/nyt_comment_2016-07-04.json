What happened when trade was restricted, when high tariffs were placed on goods from other countries?

In the 1990s Walmart became the low cost leader and customers flocked to it to buy cheap shoddy made goods. Small town main streets like Twin Falls Idaho dried up. Other companies like Target did the same to compete, and instead of complaining about lost jobs, the politicians lauded them for making life cheaper. However, their customers were decently paid workers from places like the Rust Belt. Then they discovered those jobs were no longer available for their kids. <br/><br/>Those same people were buying Toyotas and Hondas because they made better cars than GM and Chrysler. Even Ford lost business except for its light trucks. Would higher tariffs kept the auto industry profitable considering the quality was not what the US buyers had come to expect?<br/><br/>Just look at the motor cycle industry.

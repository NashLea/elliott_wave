It's a rhetorical device used by journalists that is inherently biased: a great example of this is Nicholas Kristof, whose writing on India is based on simplistic stereotypes, bad journalism, and frankly is racist at times. When it fits with the stereotypes of some audience members (particularly in the UK, or special interest groups with an axe to grind) it's praised as nuanced and balanced (which it isn't). However, he simply cherry picks experiences that fit with his own world view, simplistic binaries, and attempts to reassess AIDS, TB, and malnutrition rates for the entire country by simply visiting a few villages.<br/><br/>How can someone write *more* accurately about India? By adopting a more scientific approach to literature. Look at statistics for malnutrition and economic development, and see if your interviews broadly reflect that trend. Kerala has a literacy rate of &gt; 90%. If you've interviewed 5 people you cherry picked and they're all illiterate, chances are there was a selection bias in your method. This is what separates a writer from a scientist: reproducible methodology. Randomly quoting statistics without looking at construct validity is another issue: you might find an article on the Internet that claims that India's literacy rate is 62%. However, this would be incorrect: the UN/Unicef/Indian census puts it at about 75%. Being exhaustive, systematic, and redundant (ie. find multiple sources to corroborate a finding) is important.<br/><br/>Also, have an eye for nuance. While pandering to stereotypes a la Mr. Kristof might sell well with a particular demographic, it's fundamentally bad writing and bad journalism.<br/><br/>In summary: don't construct a \"narrative.\" Present comprehensive, nuanced, corroborated facts that allow for diversity. You can offer your interpretation at the end of a book, but don't let your \"opinion\" drive it.

She actually makes particle physics clear to a lay audience.<br/><br/>Randall\u2019s writings are an attempt to convince the public that science, and scientific thinking, are important.  Unfortunately, not only will most of the Perry supporters not read her book, but they do not even have the basic concepts in math and science \u2013 high school stuff \u2013 required to understand it.  Watching Randall, I wanted to cry.  She is everything that America should be, everything we should strive to be (I acknowledge that my first love was astronomy and I have always been sad that I\u2019m just not smart enough to be a physicist) \u2013 and everything that we should want for our kids.<br/><br/>Instead we are embracing stupidity; and it shows.

It \"even means,\" as I understand it, that we are all vessels containing a spark of the divine, and when that vessel is broken, that spark of divinity becomes more available to others.  When the world is struggling, making divinity more easily available to others is helpful, like breaking up food into small pieces for an invalid.  Henri Nouwen wrote on this theme a lot, and is far more cogent than I am on it.  And Father Nouwen was, in this taxonomy, on the Egghead team, I think, having taught at Harvard and Yale; but he would have been happy to break bread with members of the Blockhead team, too.

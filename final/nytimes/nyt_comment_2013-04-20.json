The Tsarnaev brothers seemed, at several steps along the way, to be *trying* to get caught.  They don't bother with disguises, or even wide-brimmed hats?  They don't even bow their heads as they walk down streets that are not only fitted with multiple security cameras, but are also being filmed by television professionals and millions of amateurs?  They don't immediately board a plane or train?  They (possibly -- I've also heard that it was an unrelated robbery) hold up a 7-11?  They carjack a car and tell the victim straight up that they're the Boston marathon bombers?<br/><br/>It's true that, in a well-planned and coordinated set of attacks, the second shoe should've dropped by now.

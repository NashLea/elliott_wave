Home making is paramount to both members of a couple, gender roles and different sexes are not.  Children are optional.  Older age excludes many from a middle-class existence, regardless of income, or net worth.  'Family life' involves all members of a household, simultaneously, doing work in the home that maintains the household.<br /><br />(3) the ability to save and to build assets for future goals and for giving to others.<br /><br />Only the physically and mentally-abled stay in the middle class for a time in their lives and so long as they actually give to others during that time, not in old age, not just at death, not in 'volunteer' work.  Leaving some assets for anyone at death and receiving the same, does not qualify the survivor as achieving a hallmark of securing a middle-class existence on their own.  Personal insurance is no substitute for achieving middle-class status.<br /><br />The middle class is a social network of people who enjoy working and being known as 'middle-class.'<br /><br />A middle-class existence is still a fading dream for most.

My father and his brothers-in-law built most of the family home (brick vs most homes on street being shingle; hardwood floors thorough out).  A family friend who did plaster work threw in a gorgeous crown moulding in the LR that's unlike anything I've seen since.   We had a junk of a car, but I lived two blocks from my junior/senior high school so I rarely needed it.  From 7th through 12th grades I walked to school and participated in onsite sports, band, school newspaper, yearly drama productions, rifle team, ROTC, Spanish club, Boy's State; you name it (I couldn't have fit in anything more if it were offered on a silver platter).  My mom was a housewife so we struggled on one salary, but because she could volunteer as a chaperone for all the school outings, I didn't need to pay the fee.  I got new clothes yearly at a very humble clothing store, but never gave a hoot about clothes anyway (quickly changing into jeans and a t-shirt as soon as I could).  I had pets, a large extended family for great holiday get togethers and when it was time for college, my straight A GPA and SATs + modest family income = full tuition scholarship to a top 10 college (US News &amp; World Report).  By objective measures, I was lower middle class - definitely.  When you factor in \"means\" I did better than many with family incomes 3X higher.

The middle class emerged in Dutch and British societies, among others, with the nascent American nation along as a rider (and the neighboring Irish somewhat rudely excluded until recently).  Liberal thought has done much to \"liberate\" us from want and fear --and risk.  Whitehead fails to recognize the important role of risk-sharing and insurance mechanisms --from joint-stock companies to the poor laws--which help push forward the progress of the industrial revolution and the emergence of a strong and growing middle class.  Indeed, one of the most important characteristics of being middle class is that one \"endures\" without tipping into disaster and poverty or death.

This blog has put the Greek debt into perspective.  Clearly, the issue is the their unemployment and the near collapse of essential services/safety net programs.  In my view it is the mission of the I.M.F. to provide liberal expansionism to preserve global economic stability.  <br/><br/>Greece is a good market for the World and Europe.  It would be folly to allow Greece to collapse.  Your last sentence in this blog gave me some hope that our money supplier will have enough sense to forgive, restructure, or write down the debt and interest and give the new liberal government a fighting chance.<br/><br/>Your analysis makes a good case that restoring Greece to economic stability and a place where their citizens can lead a good life is possible.<br/><br/>Question for your experts that I have been asked today:  Who will take a hit if the debt is restructured or the worst case defaults on payments?  Is it private lenders or is it the I.M.F. et al?  Greece is not a big debtor especially for a nation that has been in decline for years and experiencing a very long term period of high unemployment.  Remember most of capital is in the hands of very few.<br/><br/>The I.M.F. seems to be an excellent analytics team but were very wrong- headed to beat up an economy as a means to correct behavior. <br/><br/>Anyhow, I will continue to read how this fascinating challenge will be resolved.

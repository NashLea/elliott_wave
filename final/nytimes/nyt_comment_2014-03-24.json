From what I've heard, Piketty's book is a masterpiece, and I look forward to reading it when I get it from Amazon.<br/><br/>I do not favor high taxes on capital gains and dividends, because these can help people of moderate means prepare for retirement.<br/><br/>But the estate tax is another thing altogether.  Too much inherited wealth will indeed kill democracy over time.  The part of Paul Ryan's \"road map\" which eliminates estate taxes is a disaster.", "recommendationCount": 17}, {"assetID": 3397397, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/a-doyens-rebellion/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11399274, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Girish Kotwal", "createDate": "1395573836", "userID": 69024476, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1395636942", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Louisville, KY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1395633342", "commentSequence": 11399274, "commentBody": "I would like to add that the BJP is not the only major party experiencing an overhaul and upheaval during the changing of guard to younger leaders, the Indian National Congress also has several of its long term leaders who have served as cabinet ministers in key portfolios like finance, defense, home, agriculture are no longer contesting upcoming elections while the young son of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi is being projected unofficially as a possible prime minister should the BJP not win as projected. There is also a major flux in Indian politics with politicians crossing over to other parties. The influx due to the perceived Modi wave to the BJP is at its all time high. Clearly a welcome change in how India does business within itself and with the world is going to change dramatically for the better should Mr. Modi a progressive leader committed to the advancement of India as a whole become prime minister.

And the judgment was based on an assumption that I'm sure is largely inaccurate: Parents (of all stripes) who use these machines do so largely as _complement_ or _supplement_ to numerous other activities, all geared towards getting the baby the right environment. My baby had colic, as well, and while he was able to fall asleep in our arms and during our shushing, the minute we put him down, he'd awaken again. We used this machine for a while in order to help _add_ to the sleep environment we wanted. As a parent, you should get that concept.<br/><br/>(2) @ TrixieB; you're right, it's not a good idea to condition the baby to _only_ sleep with white noise. And a baby will adapt, as you point out. <br/><br/>My post-colic child now falls to sleep easily without white noise, but I'm sympathetic to a parent who's at wit's end to get their child to fall to sleep. Sleeping \"like a baby\" is an accurate term, but only after the point where the baby's brain has developed sufficiently to _enable_ him to have deep sleep (three months). Deep sleep occurs between 35 and 55 minutes _after_ the baby falls asleep. The period before that, the baby is in REM sleep, among other parts of the cycle, which is a period of light sleep and easy arousal. A child awakened at this point may then stay awake for hours more.

Moreover, for a scholarly exploration, see Sudbury's \u201cCelling Black Bodies: Black Women in the Global Prison Industrial Complex,\u201d Feminist Review, 70 (2002), 57-74. Sudbury begins her commentary with an anecdote about a mother and daughter being sentenced. The older woman was not directly involved in drugs, but was given a longer sentence because, the court reasoned, she should have known about her daughter's involvement in drugs and because the younger woman was pregnant. I believe Sudbury's account was in a European court, but is nonetheless instructive about what obtained in the US. Judges merit a closer examination because the mandatory-minimum policy (and War on Drugs) disparately impacted black women, catapulting them to twice the incarceration rate (and number) of both white and Hispanic women combined.

It's been well documented that military psychologists have been encouraged to avoid a diagnosis of PTSD in favor of diagnosing a pre-existing personality disorder in those who suffer ill symptoms and serious behavioral problems following combat.

My relatives there (now ranging from 87- 91 years old) and those now deceased (ranging up to 99 years old) received good care from the NHS (whose 'network' in US-insurance speak is essentially all physicians and surgeons in the country). This included hip replacement as soon as medically necessary, a pacemaker, a pacemaker defibrillator, etc.  The only time waiting was an issue (or would have been in the US) was when my father visited a US cardiologist, who recommended a pacemaker.  His UK doctor said not on the NHS, though if you want to go privately it could be done. He cited statistics: you are 85, any surgery or anaesthesia is risky for you. I estimate the risk of serious surgical complications (stroke or death) as 10%. The risk of heart failure resulting in serious complications or death in the next 2 years is about 2%, but it rises over time. I'll see you at the end of each 12 months. After 2 years he said it was time to do it, and it was done two weeks later. The entire cost was about $30, and that was a taxi.<br/>Home visits by doctors are common when the patient is really ill. (No charge.)  My eldest relative receives 4 visits daily from health aides of various kinds, because he suffered a stroke. (No charge.) He is still in his own home."}]}, "lft": 912, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/us/new-laws-demands-on-doctors-have-many-seeking-a-network.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11269416, "rgt": 919, "userDisplayName": "Lori", "createDate": "1393911509", "userID": 58957024, "replyCount": 3, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1393911545", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1393953109", "commentSequence": 11269416, "commentBody": "I have many colleagues in Germany.

They are not primarily for-profit, however. Medical care in Germany is excellent. If you are accepted, medical school is free. Physicians are highly trained, more than US: MD's must also do PhD level research dissertations (not required in US). Medications and procedures are similar to, and often more advanced than US.<br/><br/>Health plans cover more services that US, including rehab, post-natal, post-surgery programs, etc. Each town has a mobile ambulance that goes to the home and provides most care; the ER's are used only for true emergencies. Of course all this is paid for by taxes but most citizens are quiet pleased with the care they receive. This system has existed for decades and is not related to employment, as in USA. There are no \"networks\"; you can choose any MD you want and stay for years if you want. There is little \"corporate\" medicine.<br/><br/>I have received some superb medical care there while visiting, and I know my colleagues' abilities and training are excellent.

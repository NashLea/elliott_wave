The pro=lifers are nuts! Well, I thought these were my positions before reading this article (and seeing these comments). The choice crowd must think about the ethics herein... This is not an easy question and a knee jerk condemnation doesn't work.  <br/><br/>The goal of routine prenatal screening is to ensure that the fetus develops without major defects. If the mother finds out the child is missing a major organ and will barely survive, sure, abort.  Here though, the mother finds out that her child has Down's syndrome. This is a real person. We are really on a slippery slope.  <br/><br/>Remember, these mothers did not decide to have an abortion for personal reasons. They screened the fetus out of love.  The mother-child relationship was already forming.  The test, in a way, is an early act of LOVE.  Is it okay to break the bond if they learn that the child has Down's? The mother that took the time to ensure this life was okay and now chooses to no longer love.  <br/><br/>This is a very different from how we usually perceive choice, where the rationale tends to revolve around a mother that is not ready to carry or to be a parent. <br/><br/>For me, this type of choice brings up many real ethical questions for liberals like myself. These include the primary goals of prenatal screening, defining the slippery slope of what makes a life meaningful, and the message sent to real parents who love Down's children.

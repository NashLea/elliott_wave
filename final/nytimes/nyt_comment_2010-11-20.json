His research areas have included state sponsors of terrorism, Iran, the Middle East, Europe (Italy), U.S.-China relations, intelligence, and Africa (Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) and is a leading neoconservative.[1] He is a former consultant to the United States National Security Council, the United States Department of State, and the United States Department of Defense. He has also served as a special adviser to the United States Secretary of State. He held the Freedom Scholar chair at the American Enterprise Institute where he was a scholar for twenty years and now holds the similarly named chair at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He is a contributing editor to National Review, contributes to the Wall Street Journal, and regularly appears on Fox News and on a variety of radio talk shows. He has been on PBS's NewsHour and CNN's Larry King Live, among others.[2] He is a founding member of JINSA and serves on their Board of Advisers.<br /><br />In 1974, Michael Ledeen moved to Rome where he studied the history of Italian Fascism. In 1977, he went to Washington to join the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) (then affiliated with Georgetown University). He continues to visit Italy frequently.<br /><br />In 1980, Ledeen worked for the Italian military intelligence service as a \"risk assessment\" consultant.[3] In 1981, Michael Ledeen then became Special Adviser to secretary of state Alexander Haig.<br /><br />Ledeen holds a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he specialized in Modern Europe. At Washington University in St. Louis, Ledeen was denied tenure, according to history department faculty interviewed by the Washington Post, because of questions regarding the \"quality of his scholarship\" and about whether Ledeen had \"used the work of somebody else without proper credit\". One faculty member said \"the 'quasi-irregularity' at issue didn't warrant the negative vote on tenure for Ledeen\".[3]<br /><br />Ledeen was subsequently named Visiting Professor at the University of Rome. One of Ledeen's principal mentors was the Jewish German-born historian George Mosse, for whom he was research assistant at the time. Mosse wrote two famous books on National Socialism. Another major influence on Ledeen was the Italian historian Renzo De Felice. Ledeen held political views which stress \"the urgency of combating centralized state power and the centrality of human freedom\"[4] that are said to have influenced or inspired the Bush administration.<br /><br />From your wiki link.<br /><br />ALSO:<br /><br />An interview with Ledeen:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=14797\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.frontpagemag.com...</a><br /><br />Best Wishes", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 2093592, "replies": [], "lft": 74, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/reviewing-the-bidding-on-the-climate-files/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2868490, "rgt": 75, "userDisplayName": "Leftymartin", "createDate": "1290221306", "userID": 55753860, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290231274", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Canada", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1290231274", "commentSequence": 35, "commentBody": "Girma (28) - well said.

I was not there for the OT and I would have preferred to be home with my family rather than working 7 days a week for weeks.<br />The dangers of one\u2019s job are not in question and this action hardly represents a sad precedent.  The question of the city, state and local govt claiming that the air we were breathing was safe while knowing that it was far from safe is in question. The fact that the men and women were not given the available adequate protection in the days following 9/11 is unquestioned. The argument that the sicknesses that have fallen on many of these first responders have yet to be proven is true, and maybe they will never be proven. How can one definitively say how and when someone developed cancer? They can\u2019t! What can be said is that when so many young men and women have fallen victim to numerous ailments, including rare cancers in a rate that is much higher than normal is a conclusion that can be made. Aside from dealing with minor breathing problems that developed in the weeks following 9/11 I am very fortunate. The men and women who are suffering from serious cancers and the ones who have died from cancers that their own doctors attribute to their time at ground zero are less fortunate.<br /><br />So for all you armchair critics who were sitting on a safe sofa glued to the news coverage of the event while hundreds of first responders gave their lives, maybe you should instead just post a thank you.

Thus, QE was intended to induce borrowers to borrow more by reducing the interest they would have to pay.

I think point (i) is irrefutable.  If QE did not cause long-term rates to be lower than they otherwise would have been. why have QE at all? On point (ii), PK is silent, apparently believing that he need not address it because of the low level of inflation.

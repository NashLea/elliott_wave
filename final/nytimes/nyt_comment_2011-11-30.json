He's not well-liked in any of the early states except New Hampshire, and anything in NH but an overwhelming victory would be viewed as a sign of weakness anyhow.<br/>\n2. Keep at least two far-right rivals in the race until April, splitting the far-right vote and getting to the winner-take-all states with around a third of the total delegates thus far (about half of the total will have been decided by then), and then try to win the vast majority of the winner-take-all states by 40-30-30 split decisions. He still might not be able to get enough delegates to win outright, but he might get enough that one defection by another candidate could put him over the top.<br/><br/>What really hurts Romney is that unlike in 2008, he can't score a quick knockout blow with early states. With proportional representation in place, the farthest-back candidates (Bachmann, Frothymixture, Roemer, Johnson, Huntsman) will probably drop out fairly early, leaving it to Gingrich (or another flavor-of-the-month) plus Perry (whose resources mean he won't give up easily) and Paul (who just doesn't care). Without a heavily split far-right field, Romney's path to the nomination becomes problematic, to say the least, because he just can't accumulate enough delegates early to readily win once it gets to winner-take-all.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3292986, "replies": [], "lft": 44, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/americans-used-to-be-much-more-anti-tax/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4970705, "rgt": 45, "userDisplayName": "Disappointed", "createDate": "1322637123", "userID": 56820215, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1322637192", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "France", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1322637192", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "There is an extremely important factor missing here, and that is context:<br/><br/>What was the question asked by these polls?

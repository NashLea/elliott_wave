Accepting the view point of the interview, look at the interview in  context of a white racial frame. <br/><br/>Looking at just two questions the interview discusses how white students viewed racism from an institutional or societal perspective while black students viewed it more individually. In the interview this observation is cast in the context of a white culture that is continually if even unknowingly racist contrasting with individual black victims. It could be recast in the white frame as \"whites view racism as institutional and can confront it as such while it remains personal for blacks\". I think this is what some of the comments you complain about do. My best attempt at a truly neutral statement might be: \"for whites racism generally exists apart from themselves, for blacks race exists as a part of themselves.\" <br/><br/>The same framing runs through the piece. It's not making its point aggressively, but it's easy to recognize as existing outside the white frame.

The real heroes are the few who develop crops adapted to the conditions from different regions of Africa, resistant to the diseases there and so on - the kind of things our farmers take for granted.<br /><br />Primitive farming is very sensitive to climate and the associate diseases. Our advanced farming, much less so: wheat is grown from Sweden to Brazil, so farming could adapt even to a (pre Holocene type of) massive climate change.<br /><br />Not everyone though has access to the seeds and knowledge needed - sharing, or even better custom tailoring farming seeds, knowledge, tools is the best form of help...<br /><br />PS Contrast that with the UNHELPFUL kind of information. I looked the other day at a Japanese paper in which the main rice varieties from Japan were grown at temperatures 8C higher, with bad results. The study was extremely careful and well documented and published in a prestigious journal. It was picked by the alarmist press.<br /><br />You can see immediately the fundamental flaw: at 8C temperature increase (way bigger than any climate change) you have to grow DIFFERENT kinds of rice. E.g. in China or the Philippines or India it's 8C warmer than in Japan and the rice crops are doing just fine...<br /><br />That's the kind of science favored by the IPCC at its best (at its worst it uses rumors). It's done very carefully, it's peer reviewed in prestigious journals but it has a major flaw which invalidates its meaning...<br /><br />Needless to say, the effect of such work on actual crops in third world countries is absolutely nil.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 1463464, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/the-guy-the-red-bulls-should-get/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1991075, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "fs", "createDate": "1273979709", "userID": 60440088, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1273982738", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "nj", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1273979138", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "Because Robertson is probably a transplant as most yuppies are. \"From\" Park Slope via Kansas or Minnesota.<br /><br />Henry, Ze Roberto or Ronaldinho would do wonders for our league.

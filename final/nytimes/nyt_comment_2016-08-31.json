Those in the military who have died regardless of the decency of the intentions of some wars versus the questionable nature of others should not be taken out on the military in that the last 15 years and even the first Gulf War, men are having serious mental health issues and physical health issues that are life long.  Athletes unless they have served in combat, have little idea of much of anything dangerous other than intentionally playing sports where they know they can be injured in a split second for the whole season.

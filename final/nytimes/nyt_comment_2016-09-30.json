There's the NJ Turnpike Authority, The NY Thruway Authority, The Delaware Ports Authority and more.<br/>What happens to the revenues from these transportation management systems? The NJTP was opened in 1949. Surely those bonds are redeemed by now? And yes I know there have been improvements but when was the last time you saw an improvement? Especially on the South Jersey end? The Delaware Memorial Bridge was a one bridge route for decade, how long ago was the second bridge added? You can spend a lot of time looking at the accounting for these piggy banks and come up with no answers.<br/>How much do the fees and fares keep increasing and why does none of it go to infrastructure improvements? Hundreds of toll collector jobs were eliminated by EZPASS. After the machinery was paid for where did the money go?<br/>Part of the problem is that each of these systems has become a fief of it's own. Some have millions in reserves some are short. Politics determine where a lot of it is spent.<br/>It is past time to look at the two states and see if combining these pools of money could do more. And road use taxes on gasoline should be going to roads not building commuter rail and bus routes. Let the users of these systems pay the cost through their ticket stubs.<br/>Better yet, sell all of them to private industry with strict oversight over profits and improvements.

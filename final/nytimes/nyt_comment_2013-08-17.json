Every time Braniff made a move, especially on pricing, American countered it. American Airlines, also based in the Dallas-Ft.Worth area, essentially engaged in a death match battle with Braniff. We know who lost that one. There are anti-trust provisions against predatory pricing when a bigger company tries to drive a smaller one into the ground, but apparently no one bothered to consider those laws in the case of American v. Braniff (or any other airline battle, for that matter). <br/><br/>Safety has improved markedly, but that is probably mainly due to improved aircraft and training. Otherwise, the airlines have been trying to destroy each other, if one can apply any after the fact logic to their business which, at many points, has seemed ridiculous. There are many ways to achieve monopoly power, the goal of all business owners when possible, and running the competition out of the market entirely is one of the most effective. Bankruptcy laws have been used to that same end. <br/><br/>Now, if we are ever likely to have true competition again, the govt., is probably going to have to intervene in a major way to see that start-up airlines can get \"slots\" at major airports. Since that is very unlikely to happen, we're stuck.

My second two flights between two other Latin American countries were on a US partner airline, and while we were given pillows, blankets, movies, TV programs, dinner and drinks (including beer and wine), there was virtually no leg room despite one of the overnight flights being a 7 hour journey. I could barely cross my legs, and getting up and out of the seat to use the restroom was a complete hassle for me and surrounding passengers. On my return flights I paid extra for some leg room on two different flights because of their duration, but felt that I shouldn't have to do so.

While I have not done a comprehensive study, I have often found lower fares on the legacy carriers than on Southwest.<br/><br/>They are very clever in the way they handle their pricing. They run several big sales long in advance of the busy vacation and tourist travel periods of the year. So, if you are planning two months ahead of time to visit grandmother's house or go on vacation, you can find a decent fare (still not necessarily lower than other fares). Everyone else who wants to travel without long advance planning is more than likely going to pay more than a legacy carrier. Plus, Southwest has added a bunch of business perks on top of their regular fares (early boarding, etc.) to try to get more business travelers. Over all, it adds up to this: Southwest isn't the lowest any more, by far.<br/><br/>The airline seems to be riding on its reputation of being a low cost carrier rather than being one in fact. To the minds of millions, Southwest opened up the sky to those who do not make big salaries. The budget traveler, who previously would have driven, taken a bus or stayed home, felt empowered. SW would come into a new market with low fares and people who had never flown, or very seldom flown, suddenly believed that flying was affordable. Southwest has left the low cost strategy behind.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 23}, {"assetID": 3379817, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/players-react-to-bartolis-sudden-retirement/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9748414, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Counter Measures", "createDate": "1376709203", "userID": 42572458, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1376714383", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Old Borough Park, New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1376710783", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Glad they asked the players, rather than anyone else!

Why shouldn't they have this right?  Wouldn't it be better if they could live closer to where they work rather than having to live farther out and make such long commutes that forces them to wake up earlier than they have to just to be on time?  Another thing is that I'm tired of hearing that this is prime real estate space that it's sitting on.  What exactly defines that may I ask because I feel that used pretty loosely?  The reason why Tishman Speyer hasn't raised the rents on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village is mainly because they could raise them, but then they would have to give up their tax breaks they are getting for keeping them low.  Unfortunately, they can't have their cake and eat it to.  BTW, many keep forgetting that this isn't a public housing project and that rent stabilization or regulation, which isn't even subsidized, isn't the same as affordable housing, though that isn't the same as public housing either.  Some really need to know the different between all of those.  Also, there are plenty of other housing types, but I won't go into that because the list is pretty long for that.  Nevertheless, many of those living in this complex do have jobs, and they aren't trying to live for free.  In other words, why should NYC, especially Manhattan, be only a playground for the rich?", "recommendationCount": 69}, {"assetID": 3440126, "replies": [], "lft": 93, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/stuyvesant-town-said-to-be-near-sale-that-will-preserve-middle-class-housing.html", "parentID": 16414164, "commentID": 16415378, "rgt": 94, "userDisplayName": "John Gomez", "createDate": "1445312464", "userID": 66007154, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1445313678", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1445310078", "commentSequence": 16415378, "commentBody": "Bloomberg owned stuy town?", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3440126, "replies": [], "lft": 165, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/stuyvesant-town-said-to-be-near-sale-that-will-preserve-middle-class-housing.html", "parentID": 16414279, "commentID": 16415401, "rgt": 166, "userDisplayName": "manderine", "createDate": "1445312729", "userID": 28588861, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1445313696", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "manhattan", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1445310096", "commentSequence": 16415401, "commentBody": "Why is someone greedy because they have lived and paid rent in their apt/ home for 30 years?<br/>What makes them greedy?<br/>Are you greedy because you have lived where you live?<br/>I agree with the commentor who said you sound very unhappy.<br/>Sorry for your confusion.<br/>Get a dictionary it might help.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3440126, "replies": [], "lft": 498, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/stuyvesant-town-said-to-be-near-sale-that-will-preserve-middle-class-housing.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 16415402, "rgt": 499, "userDisplayName": "Ruben Kincaid", "createDate": "1445312746", "userID": 62646401, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1445313701", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Brooklyn", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1445310101", "commentSequence": 16415402, "commentBody": "\"We're saving taxpayers a lot of money\"... by giving $77 Million in taxes away, and by \"preserving\" middle-class housing for 20 years, which will go by in a New York Minute?

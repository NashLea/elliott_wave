The fact is the videos show one thing; Carly Fiorina described them as showing another.<br/><br/>But to call that a \"lie\" is to make a judgment call; to go beyond the facts. A \"lie\" is when someone knowingly conceals or distorts the facts. To be sure it is a lie you would have to be inside Carly Fiorina's head. She may not be a liar. She may be confused. She may have misremembered what she saw. She may have been hallucinating. She may be too stupid to understand what she was seeing. She may be mentally ill. Or she may be an out-out liar. But all of those are INTERPRETATIONS of the facts - they're not facts the Times has direct access to. All the Times has direct access to is what the videos show - because anyone can watch them - and what Fiorina said - which is on record.<br/><br/>Again, I fully concur with virtually everyone here that she is a liar. My personal opinion of Carly Fiorina is that she is basically a predator. I find her loathsome. But I'm fully capable of reaching those conclusions based on REPORTING of what she has said and done, and comparing what she has said and done with reported facts.

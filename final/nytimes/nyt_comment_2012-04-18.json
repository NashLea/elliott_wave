We have created a very supportive web site that will be live in a few days called <a href=\"http://ameatfreemonth.org\" title=\"ameatfreemonth.org\" target=\"_blank\">ameatfreemonth.org</a>  We encourage people to live meat free for 30 days.

Research has shown that it only takes 21 days to create new habits and patterning. You may want to try it for yourself!

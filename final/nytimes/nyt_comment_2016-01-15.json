My most memorable on-air question for him was, \"Have you ever been fat?\" He thought it was funny, but decided to take it seriously, giving compliments to his wife Iman whom he said was a fantastic cook. One of my Halloween decorations was a battery-operated throbbing heart. It was lying on the studio furniture. While I wasn't looking, David, with this macabre device activated, stuffed it down his pants. He had to nudge me before I saw it. I laughed like a madman.

I was about 10 years old when I finally decided to set foot at the nearby shopping mall\u2019s record store, bent on buying a record with my meager savings. The first bars of \u2018Life On Mars?\u2019 caught my ear as soon as I entered the store\u2026 and they never let go. At that stage I could barely understand basic English, and was way too young to fully grasp the lyrics, but something about the song moved me to head straight for the DJ booth and meekly ask for the album. <br/><br/>When I proudly emerged from the store, with an empty velcro wallet in my pocket but an imported vinyl pressing of Hunky Dory held firmly between my grubby little hands, I felt the rush of having done something by myself, something grownups did on a regular basis. It felt good. My parents were horrified. My dad scolded me for wasting money on \u201cstupid rock music\u201d, my mom wanted to take me to church as soon as she found out that the curious-looking being on the album art was actually a dude. Thankfully the store had a strict \u201cno refunds policy\u201d, so my record was confiscated for a few days until I managed to get it back from its hiding place. In the end, David Bowie found a way to stay with me. I guess you can say he taught me more about English, music, tolerance, originality, uniqueness and independence than my parents ever could.

Professor Krugman and the Neo-Keynesian cohort have maintained from the beginning of our instant crisis and in accord with Keynesian theory that a large and robust fiscal stimulus is needed along with a robust monetary stimulus to right our economy.  <br/><br/>However, because of our dysfunctional politics and pernicious austerity economics, the Congress has never implemented an adequate fiscal stimulus, nor is it likely to do so.  That means there is no adequate stimulation of demand, so that business can earn a sufficient risk-adjusted return on borrowed money, even at these very low rates.  <br/><br/>But monetary policy of holding short-term rates at effectively zero does some good, because it prevents aggregate demand from falling below its current meager levels.  It does that in two ways:  First, it relieves debt by permitting refinancing for both consumers and businesses at low rates and also keeps variable finance charges lower, and (2) it permits financing of operations and new consumption at very low rates, without which aggregate demand would be even lower, as we've seen in the Eurozone and EU.<br/><br/>And don't worry that the assets markets will develop dangerous bubbles, for at the instant rates of unemployment, low prices of real assets and goods, and our recent experience with bubbles, that is quite unlikely.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3365409, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 8709882, "replies": [], "commentID": 8710042, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Skiphil", "createDate": "1365311395", "userID": 67503967, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1365361884", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 6, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Susan Anderson", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1365358284", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I agree that \"significant human caused climate change is occurring.\"<br/><br/>Wow, that was easy.<br/><br/>Guess what, such a statement is only the beginning, not the end of the discussions and analyses for most folks of a \"skeptical\" bent.

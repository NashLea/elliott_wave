The reasoning behind this counter-intuitive point is that one of the main causes for the increase in the deficit over the past few years has been the decline in tax revenues and increase in social safety net spending that was triggered by the 2008 Bush Recession.  Recovery from that recession would help government bring in more revenue, and would reduce the number of people who need to receive unemployment benefits, Medicaid, etc.  But with both consumers and corporations reluctant to spend - consumers because they are still digging out from the housing meltdown and are uncertain about their job prospects, and corporations due to a lack of demand - the only way to get the economy fully moving again is federal stimulus spending.  That may cause a short term increase in the deficit, but in the long term such spending would likely decrease the debt.  Unfortunately, the GOP, which is looking to hold our economy down through at least the 2012 elections, understand the importance of stimulus spending to economic recovery and it is why they are trying to distract us all with talk of debt.  <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 505}, {"assetID": 3298197, "replies": [], "lft": 170, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/where-the-real-jobs-are.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5170188, "rgt": 173, "userDisplayName": "Kevin Rothstein", "createDate": "1325482080", "userID": 44053468, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1325482095", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1325482095", "commentSequence": 11, "commentBody": "Why should any American believe anything the right wing Republicans claim about anything?

The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped demonstrate the benefits of an underground transportation system. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, that of the BMT West End Line, was in use in 1863 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.\"<br/><br/><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#History\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#History\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#History</a><br/><br/>Which begs the question:<br/><br/>How were the German and Japanese underground mass-transit systems doing in 1904 ?"}]}, "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/nyregion/mta-reduces-subway-service-on-a-few-minor-holidays.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5170225, "rgt": 71, "userDisplayName": "AF", "createDate": "1325482917", "userID": 14095658, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1325482935", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1325482935", "commentSequence": 21, "commentBody": "The comment by one reader that \"the NYC subway system is crap compared to similar systems that are more current, cleaner and better staffed like those in Japan, Germany and the UK\" is spot on.<br/><br/>The real question, however, is WHY we are falling behind other countries.  There is a reason why public transit (both locally within cities and over longer distances, such as high-speed rail, etc.) is so much better in other industrialized countries than it is here.   Those countries actually invest in their infrastructure, while we seem to think we can skimp on funding and still have decent public transport.  Not so.

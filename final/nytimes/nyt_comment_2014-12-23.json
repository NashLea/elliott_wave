For instance, I may be able to eat an entire Cheesecake Factory dish of 2400 calories in one sitting and leave stuffed to the gills.  But even if my body can temporarily override my desire to stop eating in that context (perhaps an evolutionary response to food scarcity), I'll be so full that I likely won't want to eat anything again until the next afternoon.  My body will simply \"roll over\" the calories into the following day.  I can't fool it that easily.<br/><br/>Also, and this is just anecdotal, but I find that it is much easier to eat large portions of some foods than others.  French fries and chips, for instance.  On the other hand, it's not easy to overeat steak.  I find that it is so heavy, rich and filling that you rapidly achieve satiety.  This is not the case for very lean meats like chicken breast or turkey, however, so I suspect it is at least in part related to the fat content of the meat.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3418299, "replies": [], "lft": 269, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/22/upshot/what-2000-calories-looks-like.html", "parentID": 13658501, "commentID": 13659956, "rgt": 270, "userDisplayName": "TL", "createDate": "1419308704", "userID": 59416080, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1419311181", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "ATX", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1419311181", "commentSequence": 13659956, "commentBody": "Sonic: on par with Easy Bake.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3418299, "replies": [], "lft": 263, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/22/upshot/what-2000-calories-looks-like.html", "parentID": 13658422, "commentID": 13660026, "rgt": 264, "userDisplayName": "TL", "createDate": "1419309878", "userID": 59416080, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1419311190", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "ATX", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1419311190", "commentSequence": 13660026, "commentBody": "@ Sparkly Violet:<br/><br/>Top chef indeed.

Mostly, however, it thrives on using legally suspect practices to protect the university's interest by engaging in deceptive practices that achieve the single-minded goal of acquiring promising athletes to benefit top revenue-producing basketball programs.  <br/><br/>This sounds like civil racketeering by another name.<br/><br/>When NCAA college recruiters, and the industry that it supports, collude to engage in civil crimes and, in the process, leech the talents of under-age students, there should be grave penalties that actually deter a kind of human-trafficking that exploits young people.<br/><br/>How and why is Tom Moore still coaching at a major university program?   And, on its face, who believes Tom Calhoun\u2019s protestations that he did not know Connecticut used affiliated agents to help this student-athlete in forbidden ways?<br/><br/>Why are there not federal civil investigations for collusion in what, on its face, appears to be a racket designed to provide financial benefits to amateur student-athletes, to utilize academically counterfeit high schools, and to seat phantom test-takers on the nation\u2019s premier college-entrance exam?<br/><br/>And how absurd is it that all this exists in an effort to benefit private and public universities that profit from federal government largess in the form of multi-million dollar research grants, and millions more in financial aid, that is connected to their ability to attract these student-athletes to their institutions?<br/><br/>Clearly, there is a system in place in that engages in suspect activity that conspires to mine, in particular, under-age Blacks, for their basketball talent \u2013 a talent whose monetary value in terms of broadcast and media rights winds up subsidizing educational institutions, some of which enjoy, paradoxically, both colossal financial endowments and federal not-for-profit tax-exempt status.  <br/><br/>College recruiters, coaches, athletic directors, provosts, and presidents, as part of their NCAA exploits, get paid to connive to improve the university\u2019s bottom line financially as they pimp a product to television networks, college apparel companies, and video game makers (amongst others) that are willing to pay handsomely, in the many millions of dollars in fact, for the rights to broadcast the actual images and/or otherwise utilize the likenesses of young students who, too often, have no one looking out for their interests.<br/><br/>The NCAA\u2019s own investigations and sanctions are not a strong enough deterrent to wayward collegiate agents and employees.<br/><br/>A federal investigation by the Justice Department that determines civil liability and metes out enforceable sanctions would be more apt to change the practices of the NCAA and its loosely affiliated cottage industries.<br/><br/>It is long past time that our civil authorities look past the practice of finding financially vulnerable, academically ineligible and athletically gifted students and exploiting what these students don't have (money and education) in order to take advantage of what they do have (basketball talents).  <br/><br/>But the NCAA alone is not to blame.<br/><br/>Most who tune into NCAA broadcasts and otherwise support college athletics should be more upset about how vulnerable youngsters, with so much to gain and so little to lose, are trafficked to the top programs in a college athletic association that may or may not look out for the student\u2019s growth academically, athletically and ultimately professionally.<br/><br/>But you know what?  <br/><br/>This did not factor in my consideration when watching March Madness.<br/><br/>I did not think about it, at all, while filling out my tournament bracket here on the New York Times.  Truth be told: I picked Connecticut to be in the finals without at all thinking about their past recruiting violations.<br/><br/>A team's violations did not cross my mind, as I checked my favorite website for the latest score, or while I enjoyed coverage on the three (or are there more?) networks that paid millions for the rights to broadcast this year\u2019s basketball tournament.<br/><br/>Rarely do most of us, I would venture to say, even think about the vulnerabilities, the back stories, haunting many of the athletes whose own trials and tribulations become an afterthought.  <br/><br/>That\u2019s if we even think about them at all.<br/><br/>We are all part of the collusion unless actively engaged to change this system.  And change it we must.<br/><br/>Maybe next year, I suppose, as I plan to watch the finals on Monday.  I don\u2019t know.  Maybe not if Connecticut makes it.  <br/><br/>I know.

Sometimes the perspective of the junior officer is lost amidst the focus on the hardships present in the life of junior enlisted members or the high level machinations of general officers.  2ndLt Gasper's job as a platoon commander is a difficult task, and it seems his Marines are fortunate enough to have a strong leader to shepherd them through this deployment.<br/><br/>Additionally, Gasper's commentary regarding the often uncomfortable relationship between the Marine infantry forces and associated supporting elements is a difficult situation to describe.  Without question, the infantry is the central element and well deserving of primary focus.  With that said, Gasper's complaint about struggling to provide currency to his mission and the associated maintenance and training elements is not a rare battle.

These are live human beings dependent for their lives on his decisions and on the decisions of other young men and women, young Americans, schooled in our schools, raised in our homes.

Those flights into a combat zone are a real experience. I'm a military brat, so I've been flying pretty much since birth with no problems with airsickness, but I've nearly lost it on MAC flights into and out of Baghdad. Evasive maneuvers, my foot. I think Air Force just does it to see how many ground pounders they can make sick.

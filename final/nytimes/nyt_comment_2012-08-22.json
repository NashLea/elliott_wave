His partner Sal killed by the FBI was only 18 years old and had been in prison in the past, Sal Naturale John Wojtowicz partner was raped in prison, that is why he did not want to go back to prison. He was a kid from a dysfunctional family who had two sisters in a foster home. His death was a tragedy that the movie never really went into. Salvatore Naturale was a kid not a man, and did not have to be killed. The reason agents felt the need to kill him was possibly that they were aware he was raped in prison many times and did not want to go back. The agent that ultimately killed him stated that he had the rifle pinned against roof of the car, so I guess the agent shot the kid out of nervousness. Naturale wanted the money to get his two sisters out of foster care and out of his dysfunctional mother\u2019s household. If they do another movie, I hope they go into Naturale\u2019s life a bit more. The movie did not go into Sal\u2019s life at all. They used an older actor John Cazale because people may have been outraged by a possibly unnecessary killing of a young juvenile that very likely could have been taken alive and reformed. He did fire the weapon at the police but it was a warning shot not a kill shot; he never killed anyone in his life. His love for his sisters showed he could not have been all-bad and he was just a kid.

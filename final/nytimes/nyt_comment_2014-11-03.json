Businesses (&amp; business people) generally do not spend much time analyzing failure.  They are only interested in success.  Economics may be 'the dismal science', but it has a strong body of theory and makes serious efforts to be scientific.<br/><br/>Business schools teach and learn by anecdote study, individual stories, cases, usually of success or of solved problems.  There is rarely the attempt at controlled studies, double blind, design of experiments, or other tools of science and academic engineering.  There is no effort to develop standard models that represent the successful business or the failing business.  <br/><br/>And worst of all, business history is almost entirely ignored except to spin happy tales of brilliant men achieving success over time.  Institutional memory fades with shredding of document requirements, retirements, and lay-offs.  Often there is no real memory of why and how failure or success really happened.  Thus, business culture abhors science, and seeks to hide its history from tax men, regulators, and the public.

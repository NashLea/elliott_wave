Mainly it is because we have not worked to address the problem in our educational system and stamp it out. When a police officer arrives with racist attitudes or latent hostility toward minorities, an effort could be made to either change the officer's outlook or move him or her out of the job. Instead, the leadership and city officials ignored massive violations of Constitutional rights while, apparently, paying no attention to racism as a problem. This is not an uncommon, nor is it limited to Ferguson by any means.<br/><br/>American police officers receive much less training than those in Europe and other wealthy nations. That's part of the overarching difficulty. If a police commander orders officers to violate Constitutional rights, the officer has to know what those rights are to be able to resist. It is clear that one short session of training is not enough, that police officers need recurrent training as well.<br/><br/>Take away ALL of the Tasers from the Ferguson police force. They are an invitation to the use of excessive force because they allow an officer to \"take control\" of a situation with less risk of death or serious injury to the perpetrator. They are a fascist's dream weapon. They don't belong on American streets.<br/><br/>It is clear we need a much stronger, wider and sustained effort to defeat racism. We had the great Civil Rights movement, but it was not enough.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 11}, {"assetID": 3423404, "replies": [], "lft": 335, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/us-calls-on-ferguson-to-overhaul-criminal-justice-system.html", "parentID": 14318317, "commentID": 14318753, "rgt": 336, "userDisplayName": "Vox", "createDate": "1425528762", "userID": 67803200, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1425531818", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "<br/>", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1425531818", "commentSequence": 14318753, "commentBody": "What's wrong with not allowing felons and criminals to vote?", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3423343, "replies": [], "lft": 1289, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/politics/using-private-email-hillary-clinton-thwarted-record-requests.html", "parentID": 14317666, "commentID": 14318050, "rgt": 1290, "userDisplayName": "fran soyer", "createDate": "1425521698", "userID": 57179778, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1425531833", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "ny", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1425531833", "commentSequence": 14318050, "commentBody": "Yeah, like the time the Secretary of State dangled a phony vial of anthrax in front of the world, and showed satellite photos of Saddam's WMD facilities, proving that he was on the precipice of using chemical and nuclear weapons against us all.  <br/><br/>Who was that guy ?

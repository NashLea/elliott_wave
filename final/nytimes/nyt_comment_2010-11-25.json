Compare the US to any other country in the world, no one has better infrastructure for the womens game with the exception of Germany and maybe Sweden. Most countries have nothing and even England will only have a semi-pro league by next year.<br /><br />Yes, every team in the world would like to have a Marta, but if you've read NYT's profile on her last year (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/magazine/05marta-t.html?scp=5&amp;sq=marta&amp;st=cse), you\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/magazine/05marta-t.html?scp=5&amp;sq=marta&amp;st=cse), you</a>'d realise that Brazil never did much to encourage her talent. It isn't Abby Wambach's fault that she was born a giant and not a soccer magician. I too prefer to watch Marta on TV than AW, but AW has contributed a lot to WNT. The woman must hold some kind of record for getting her head busted open. For that, we should be grateful.<br /><br />Brazil has entertaining players, but their FA has zero funding for their womens team, no professional woman's league, and in general, not a great attitude towards the endeavor. Clearly, they did nothing to deserve the talent they ended up with. The true comparison to the US is Germany, who are heads and shoulders above the rest right now. They also play a physical, not very attractive style. But they're great at it. The creation of the WPS might have actually hurt the WNT because they don't play together year round anymore, whereas Germany still keeps their talent domestic, with less foreign players than WPS. But all is not lost, we have some great young players up front like Alex Morgan and Amy Rodriguez and we have no shortage of awesome goalies.<br /><br />Best of luck to the US WNT tomorrow in Chicago.

C. and pretty much destroyed all kinds of peoples lives by pushing through legislation, that normally would not have taken place. This case has shed light on some of those injustices. unfortunately the light sentencing he will receive for violating the public trust will pale compared to what he should get.  I know Tom will seek to re-base line his conviction and re-frame this great miscarriage of justice.<br /> I really think that he has gotten a fair trial in Texas, so how could the out come be any different on appeal other than on some technicality. Well I am sure figure that out when they get there I hope sentencing can find the right balance of punishment, probation doesn't seem right for someone who knows better and is held to a higher level of standards. This graft need to be corralled and roped in with some good ol' fashion Texas style justice and I wish hanging were still on the table.  Maybe Tom can fix it all on appeal and still get to push his wife into a job at the FAA in 2012 like he tried a few years ago. What could she need to know? heck shes ridden on planes before right, and with Lockheed-Martin greasing the way, pee-u well that next big contracting opportunity is just a few years a way. yee-haw y'all thanks for all the hard work send us another real soon ya hear now.

A core problem with the consumer credit rating systems is not just their ability to identify poor applicants, but the misunderstanding of what makes a quality applicant. <br/><br/>The entire system qualifies quality applicants primarily based on the amount of credit they have taken out and paid off on time. This completely misses individuals who have little need for debt outside of large ticket items. For instance, an individual carrying only one credit card and a mortgage which are always paid on time are unlikely to have a stellar credit rating. <br/><br/>How can it be that a well capitalized individual who rarely needs credit does not have a superior credit rating?

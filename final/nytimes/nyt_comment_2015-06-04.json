Without further reforms, the jobs themselves will just be moved physically overseas.  Corporations are spanning geographic boarders and they will just move the job to the location with the most favorable labor laws.  <br/><br/>in the mean time, we will have to remain adaptable and look for the growing industries where companies are investing in their business.  That could be R/D, Expansion, ect.  These companies will pay a premium for good talent because they realize they are an investment.   They will actively train their employees, they will compensate them fairly and do everything they can to retain the good talent because its vital to their growth.  Corporations with business lines that have matured and they are simply milking the golden goose will take these regressive cost cutting measures because they are making an admission the business is in decline.   These cost cutting measures may be implemented to fund a transformation in the business and invest in other business lines that are hiring.   They could simply be used to deliver value to the shareholders to prop up the stock price and thus cheap borrowing.    <br/><br/>While the corruption needs dealt with and its egregious,  we need to remember its our own personal responsibility to keep our skills current and to act proactively when we see the signs.

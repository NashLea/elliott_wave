This could explain why teachers here are not paid as well and why it is harder to attract those who are interested in passing on their love of the subject matter in which they are expert.  I know from my own experience that until I learned that a love of mathematics and teaching it to others did not mean a profession where I was expected to see who was smoking in the boys' room or supervising lunch rooms did I decide to go to college and become a mathematician.  You would not catch me dead teaching mathematics in a public high school because it is not really about teaching in such a place.

The Swiss schools did not offer several dozen different programs with virtually no evidence that they helped students learn.

Reforming schools is simpler then the we have made it. Tucker says it all: \"The main thing that works is treating teaching as a profession, and teachers as professionals.\" Professionalization of teaching means both more authority and more accountability. When I began teaching in 1959 teachers in my public school system ( 13,000 students, 28 schools), were highly respected by students, parents, and their community. That the school was nationally recognized helped, but what was more important was that the community believed their teachers would educate every child and held us accountable for that.  In return we were given real authority to teach and were expected to collaborate and innovate recognizing good schools need to continuously improve. That culture made it a place where teachers wanted to work and learn as a professional.

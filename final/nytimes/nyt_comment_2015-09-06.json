I expect he has read the news on Germany today, and as I celebrate it, I wonder if Donald might feel he may have been led by the nose down the wrong path regarding the position he has taken on building the wall. I like his idea that it should be done, and done well, but with a big welcome gate at every legal entry like the one you New Yorker's had at Ellis Island.<br/><br/>I lived in Marianna, a small little mining town in southwest Pennsylvania. Just outside town lies a large Russian Orthodox cemetery dating from the 1800s. When Bethlehem Steel executives heard of the mass immigration of Russian families exiting Czarist Russia for Ellis Island, it sent a team of representatives to the island with only one marching order. I paraphrase: \"If you see a Russian family get off any boat or ship, offer them a train ticket to Pittsburgh and a home in Marianna and a lifetime job.\"<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was proud to meet many of the descendants of these Russian immigrants.<br/><br/>As a 10th generation American of German extraction, I salute the German nation today, and I welcome the possibility that Donald and Hilary and all the other presidential candidates will revisit the immigration issue with an open mind.<br/><br/>All New Yorkers should all understand this as well as anyone on the planet!

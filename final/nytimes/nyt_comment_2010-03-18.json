However, at this small intimate and expensive dinner, Tom did not even have the courtesy to mingle with guests, participate in cooking the meal, or even have the courtesy to stay for the dinner. In fact, in his opening remarks all he really did was remind all the guests how very lucky WE were to be in his presence and in fact he didnt even want to show up....he is just too busy these days. Myself and the guests at my table were all rather insulted. And to add insult to injury the meal was mediocre at best. To be expected I guess since Tom only stayed for about 15 minutes. To say the food served was unimaginable, poorly executed and just plain bland is being nice. I am officially boycotting Tom's restaurants and I urge you too as well.

These are commercial typed rabbits that are grown for meat. There are many breeds that are more suitable as pets, but they too are edible.  Rabbits are livestock, just as a cow, pig, chicken or sheep. Rabbits are wonderful because they are a multi-purpose animal. I know some people keep them as pets, but it is not disgusting to be able to raise your own meat supply. . I doubt I'd be replying to a vegetarian article complaining about how they grow the carrots or upset that there is no meat on the menu.<br /> It is good that people are taught how to grow and produce their own food.

So, will we see Arends as others like him pushing for opening the colossal domestic U.S. oil reserves that probably lie offshore in the Atlantic and Pacific coats, currently off-limits to oil exploration and jobs? What about the massive oil shales in Montana, the proven oil Alaska?\"<br /><br />According to the Energy Information Administration, if all lower 48 states drilling was allowed, there would be not discernible increase in production for over a decade.  By 2030, there would be a 3 percent increase in our domestic production, which would amount to around or a little under 2 percent of the percentages of oil that we currently import.   Neglible, and nothing for 2 decades.Not sure how much Alaska adds, claims are all over the place, but the most credible ones (again the EIA) think is around the lower 48 or a little more.<br /><br />Also, there are many reasons for getting of of oil -- and no real reason for staying on it.  (One, and only one, if one accepts the presumption that we can't positively grow without oil, and that growth -- rather than the type of growth, is dependent upon using oil.)<br /><br />There is no reason for being reliant upon foreign oil, and sending hundreds of billions overseas to boot, often to unfriendly regimes.  Switching our passenger fleet over to plug in hybrids alone would undermine the need for close to 2/3 of of the oil we import (rather than 2 percent of it), and that's assuming a static model where there are no further developments in vehicles. (Transpo' accounts for 68% of our oil use, we import 60%).<br /><br />Oil is also highly polluting aside from co2. And then there is co2 itself: What we are doing is taking carbon that was sequestered over hundreds of millions of years (as the earth,correspondingly,tended to cool) and releasing it in a geologic instant, quickly putting  us back to the levels of GHG in Global Warming Potential     equivalents (GWPe) in part because we are increasing other GHG as well -- that existed when much of the land was underwater, and the climate radically different (and hotter.)<br /><br />It pretty much makes a lot of sense to try and develop incentives right now, not tomorrow, to use less and less of the stuff (which won't happen on its own -- as George Bush noted, we are 'addicted' to it) and incentives to develop, implement and use smarter energies.<br /><br />Also, note there is a lot of confusion over the issue of \"climate change\" from co2, and the inherent idea that since we don't see oceans 100 fee higher, and the earth becoming jungly and scorched, that therefore it doesn't work this way.<br /><br />Actually the way it doesn't work is on our human time frame, so we naturally over focus on the relevance of what is a human time frame (where a few years are said to tell us so much) versus a geologic time frame. Climate shifts rapidly on a geologic time frame (or can) but that might mean 10 years, it might mean 90 -- but the point is the effect of increased GHG levels is something that will build over time, particularly as oceans retain heat (Revkin promised a post on sea heat levels) -- an inordinately slow process, and the ultimate driver of climate.  It is not a simple equation of tomorrow we make GHG levels X amount and the climate is immediately Z shape in response.

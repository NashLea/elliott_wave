There's just no way any match could live up to the thrilling semifinal between Federer and Djokovic, and it's my opinion that both of those women knew that.  It's not excuse for Zvonereva, but she obviously wilted in that setting, that huge stadium.  They both could have played there hearts out and it still wouldn't have measured up.  That's simply not fair to women's tennis, because it sets them up to fail no matter what.<br /><br />I can hear the criticism already, so let me buttress my argument.  I've been watching tennis for a long time, and it seems to me that the real contests in the Slams are the semifinals.  Very often they're the most competitive and alive matches of the tournaments.  You hear the t.v. commentators say as much.  My opinion since nobody asked or ever will, play the women's final before the men's semis.<br /><br />And the prize money announcement was hugely embarrassing for Clijsters - you could see it all over her face when Mary Carillo practically yelled it out.  It was tacky to an extreme and Clijsters' face just registered this horrified look.  Anyway, I'm a big fan of both of those women.

While I absolutely do not condone anti-Islamic speech or the ridiculous burning of Korans, I believe that those who wish to build a mosque at ground zero do not truly have interfaith understanding in mind.  Please don't pretend that the huge crowds of Muslins in the middle east did not cleebrate in the streets on September 11, 2001.   And although I, as many Americans, wanted to believe in 2001 that the hijackers were part of a marginalized group, that does not now appear to be the case.  Imams who were declared as moderate back then, have proved to be otherwise (e.g. Anwar Al-Awlaki).  I have a great deal of respect for your opinions, and I am usually energized by your columns.  But as much as I respect the rights of all to religious freedom, I still believe that the proposal to build a mosque near ground zero is at its core a monument to a bloody victory.", "recommendationCount": 62}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

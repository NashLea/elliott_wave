That's absurd. <br/><br/>Yes, we should all stay home and study as much as possible; it will make us successful and keep us safe. But telling women they should just \"stay home and study\" actively prohibits them from feeling as if they have a right to enter into social spaces and from feeling that they will be protected if they experience sexual assault while socializing, whether sober or intoxicated. By saying such a thing you perpetuate the idea that it's a woman's fault if she is assaulted.", "recommendationCount": 12}, {"assetID": 3400637, "replies": [], "lft": 278, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/opinion/sunday/bruni-america-the-shrunken.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11719472, "rgt": 279, "userDisplayName": "Wesley Clark, MD", "createDate": "1399176514", "userID": 40300435, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1399176545", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1399172945", "commentSequence": 11719472, "commentBody": "Oh come on! The only trend Mr. Bruni notes that is worth worrying about is the economic stagnation of the middle class and poor. And the reason that is happening is because of our hideously unfair tax system, which lets hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than janitors; an antipathy to public spending that allows our schools to crumble and turn violent while our banks have banner years; and a health care system which costs twice as much as anyone else's, with worse results. Once the deeply frightened, totally irresponsible, and deeply weird people now dominating the Republican party have aged out, presumably we can get back to being a civic-minded, fair, and optimistic country.<br/><br/>The other trends he seems to be worried about - America \"walking small;\" China having a bigger total economy (NOT a bigger per-capita economy, by a long shot, though you would never know that by reading Bruni); \"reduced\" international expectations - are just the made-up worried of overgrown boys, deeply insecure and needing to puff out their chests. If America becomes less expansionist and interventionist internationally, the entire rest of the world will breathe a sigh of relief.

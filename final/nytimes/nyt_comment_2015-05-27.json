Steffi Graf.  Winner of many LOVE GAMES.  Father well-known for frequent court appearances (that's criminal court, not tennis court).  Also was the undisputed BEST in the world for some time.  Most important, one of her crazed German fans stabbed Monica Seles (then ranked No. 1) so Graf could regain No. 1 standing (which she did).  Bringing a knife to a tennis fight?  \"That's the Chicago way.\"  Bonus:  Highly photogenic.<br/><br/>All 3 meet the Tuesday criteria, I believe.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3429871, "replies": [], "lft": 19, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/sports/soccer/how-a-fax-helped-rewrite-womens-soccer-in-the-us.html", "parentID": 15054743, "commentID": 15056827, "rgt": 20, "userDisplayName": "Paul", "createDate": "1432689837", "userID": 34677113, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1432703093", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Bellerose Terrace", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1432699493", "commentSequence": 15056827, "commentBody": "Only a few plying in Europe or Japan would be making more than a subsistence wage in the NWSL without the living subsidies that the USSF is paying to players who are making the roster. It's why the same players get run out, over and over again, even in meaningless friendlies. In a better world, those friendlies would be used to see up and coming prospects, but without making a minimum number of appearances, subsidies are cut, which is consequential. But it is not a system that is sustainable in the long run, nor is it for the ultimate betterment of the USWNT.<br/>Re Scholarships: The most consequential misunderstanding about them is that, on the part of the schools and coaches, it is NOT a four year commitment; it is four, one year scholarships, renewable at the caprice of the coach. Tear a ligament, and the scholarship could be rescinded. Don't get along with the coach, and risk losing the ride. Have another recruit coming in who plays your position? You might not have a scholarship anymore.

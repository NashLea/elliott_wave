He has no understanding of the meaning of a drive.  It's not always just about scoring points.  Sometimes you just need a few first downs.  If you score, it's gravy, but first and foremost, give the D a rest.  He is clueless in this regard.  Low percentage deep passes on 3rd and shorts, coming out pass-happy at the start of a series after the D has just been gassed for a long drive.  It goes on and on.  His play calling is always the same, never tailored to an opponent, to the weather, to anything.  Just the same plays in the same situations.  He'd call the same game against the '85 Bears in 10 degrees and wind as he would against this year's Colts in a cloudless day in Hawaii.  I've never seen a coach sleepwalk through his job like Gilbride does.  Why can he sleepwalk?  Because Coughlin is blindly loyal to him....which is why they should both be fired, regardless of whether the Giants make the playoffs.  Santa, bring me a new coach!

Senators John Kyle and Orin Hatch for ridiculing the unemployed as lazy people who really don't want to work, and for Hatch's particularly obnoxious comments about the jobless preferring to watch TV and spend their benefits on drugs. I'm sure that would have been pleasing to iconic Liberal Ted Kennedy whom Hatch always claimed to have been his great friend. <br/><br/>4. To Herman Cain for saying that the poor have only themselves to blame for their plight.<br/><br/>5. Rep. Ron Paul for saying that a sick uninsured man should be left untreated to die.

Bookstores employ book lovers.  <br/><br/> The French relationship to books and thus to the mind, is one of the great differences that I experience between the two cultures. In the American model, books are a commodity.  It does not matter what\u2019s in the books or how they are distributed; what matters is how many books you sell. The French have a culture to protect; the Americans think not of culture but profit. The American model needs not a thinker or a reader, but a consumer \u2013 and in this model it is better to buy more, even if of lower quality, because two illustrated cookbooks in the shopping cart is better than one slender volume of poetry or  philosophy.

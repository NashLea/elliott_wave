We know the series pays homage to classic science fiction and the theory is appealing as it references the Replicants in Philip Dick's classic novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\" (Blade Runner). The Orphan Black writers certainly like to play with this sort of thing; hence Aldous Huxley's paranoid vision of clones subsumes the human evolutionary theories of Louis Leakey in the character of Aldus Leekie. Still, I'm not convinced on this one yet. I think it's more likely that the illness of Cosima, and at least two other clones so far, is an unintended and quite horrible byproduct of creating female clones whose genetic material has been radically altered in an attempt to ensure sterility. It's notable that while the disease becomes symptomatic in the lungs, it actually starts in the uterus. jb points out that these women are patented and preventing reproduction would be a priority to ensure control of the clones' commercial value. The question is did the scientists have the slightest idea how to do this without triggering a deadly disease? As the brilliant Cosima points out in a previous episode, very little is actually know about human biology. Cosima admits to Sarah that all these geniuses don't fully understand what they're doing, they just act like they do.

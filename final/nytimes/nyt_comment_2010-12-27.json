In essence, we have two options.<br /><br />First, we can continue to try to maintain our current ways, which rely on material wealth as the primary determinant of success in our society, which relies on measures like Gross Domestic Product to determine whether our country is doing well or poorly, and which favors use of resources over efficiency and conservation.  Down that road is the continuation of our current way of life for a decade or two at most, followed by increased expense for the commodities we need, and increased economic and perhaps military strife to gain access to those commodities.<br /><br />Or, we can take a different approach, in which we use our current position at the head of the world in terms of economic, social, and educational development to transform our society into one that is prepared for a future of constrained resources.  This approach would involve maximizing efficiency to the greatest extent possible, so that we can do more with less.  It would also mean focusing on investing in the energy technologies of the future, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and wave power, so that we can continue to obtain energy while minimizing our reliance on limited resources.  And it means beginning to measure our value as individuals and as a society on things other than simple economic prowess.  For example, for individuals, we could start valuing more highly intellectual prowess, kindness to others, caring for our families, etc.  And for our country, we can value being a world leader in developing clean energy technologies, serving as an example again on civil liberties, and rebuilding international institutions that will help avoid or settle international disputes of the future.<br /><br />The choice here is currently ours, but with commodity prices rising as the rest of the world starts demanding the same resources we are currently addicted to, time is running short.   If we don\u2019t make the choice now to pursue option number two, we can be assured that option number one will be chosen for us not too far in the distant future.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br />", "recommendationCount": 293}, {"assetID": 2227806, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/opinion/27krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3136575, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "Frank Mitchell", "createDate": "1293423814", "userID": 15221065, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293426262", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "South Carolina", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293465299", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "Mr. Krugman, I disagree with your opinion that America was mostly \"just a bystander in this story.\"  When the big American corporations transferred tens of thousands of our factories and millions of our jobs to China, they also transferred our wealth and prosperity to China.

Also, the massive increase in Chinese coal-based electric power generating plants is creating a huge demand for coal that did not exist a decade ago.<br /><br />So, by building a modern industrial economy in China, our US corporations have created a culture in China which is becoming much more dependent upon crude oil and coal.  This new wealthy China will demand a much larger share of the world's finite natural resources, including oil and coal.<br /><br />So, not only have the big American corporations transferred our prosperity and jobs to China, they  have also caused a tremendous increase in the world's demand for energy.

In the case of oil in particular, world production has not increased significantly and has likely peaked. The reality of worldwide peak oil is upon us, though there are still many who think the US can simply drill its way out of the crisis. Good luck with that.<br /><br />The approach taken in the US to issues of scarcity of strategically vital commodities (oil especially and water) and how to deal with scarcity seems to have been to put entirely too much faith in market forces to adequately address them. There is no doubt that increasing prices will encourage innovation and force  consumers to seek alternatives. But the orthodox Econ 101 microeconomics models do not take into account the massive social costs inflicted and the countless individual tragedies that will occur in the process of making such a transition, especially if there are severe price shock or shortages as there might well be with oil in the US, and water is many other parts of the world. Dealing with these issues requires proactive far-sighted policy, which in turn requires strong leadership and social cohesion to support the effort. All these necessary ingredients are absent in the US.<br /><br />Most developed nations are anticipating the effects of peak oil and have developed comprehensive strategies and policy to attempt to deal with it (though the policy may yet prove inadequate). As is the case with human-generated global warming, most of the developed world has accepted peak oil as fact and are moving on in spite of the glaring absence of leadership from the US, currently the world\u2019s largest economy. The Chinese government, for all its faults, has multi-year plans to deal with changes that are obviously coming. They have the advantage of being able to implement policy without the messy constraints imposed by a democracy that values rules of law. The Chinese government does not have any rivals to its authority. Contrast this with the US where powerful industry organizations (oil and coal especially) are able to control or influence public discourse in order to prevent government action that would greatly benefit the nation in the long run, but have a negative impact on the bottom line of these economic dinosaurs. The PRC appears to be far ahead of the US and perhaps most other nations in terms of coping with looming scarcities of vital and strategic resources. While I do not mean to imply the US should mimic China exactly in how it approaches these issues, the Chinese example demonstrates that powerful leadership combined with a determined cohesive populace can address important societal issues such as future oil scarcity.

Do people even care that their sons and daughters are sterile? I have noted this information before in the New York Times and have not seen any response. Perhaps New Yorkers would be happy to be 90% sterile? Just asking. Personally, I am up in arms and will not buy anything but organic and grass fed. 90% of US corn, soy, zucchini and yellow squash are genetically modified. And chickens, beef and pork, who are fed genetically-modified corn pass it on to us. Think about this.

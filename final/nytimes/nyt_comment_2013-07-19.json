At most 3 of those teams, the Bulls, Heat, &amp; Spurs, are perennial powerhouses, and truthfully, the Bulls haven't dominated since the Jordan era, and the Spurs belie the theory of big-market dominance.

Why follow a league that has a regular season filled with meaningless games and a two-month playoff season with the winner largely pre-determined? <br/><br/>Maybe I didn't read the right stories, but for years the NBA's soft salary cap was its big open secret. Teams regularly willing to exceed the cap were perennial contenders. Players still have a clear preference for big cities and warm-weather cities, so the unbalanced playing field gets further tilted. And the referees' preferential treatment of superstars makes a bad situation worse. No wonder so many casual observers of the NBA mutter about fixed outcomes, even after Tim Donaghy has faded into obscurity. <br/><br/>The harder salary cap now in place is good; an unyielding salary cap like the NFL's would be better. A salary floor closer to the cap and increased revenue sharing would help. This last idea might be crazy, but why not require teams to play most or all of its active players during a game? A superstar-laden team like the Heat might struggle when its weak bench had to match up against a stronger bench spelling good-but-not-great starters on the other team. <br/><br/>Right now the NBA is not uniformly competitive. It's gaudy, overhyped and star-driven but it's ultimately predictable and boring if your team isn't a favorite for the Finals.

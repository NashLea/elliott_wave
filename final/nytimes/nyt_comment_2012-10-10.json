Ideally it needs 3 to 4 changes that would go a long way in setting things right but no political party will have guts or support to work these changes.<br/><br/>There is one sweeping change  that can remediate 60 to 70 percent of ills in the current system and the political  party that does it will benefit too, so should be doable. That one sweeping change will be to reserve 50% of all seats in reserved categories to below poverty line candidates. This one change will ensure that percolation of benefits in backward castes increases at the same time allowing time social changes to happen as other 50 does go to other candidates in the same caste/category.<br/><br/>Other changes that should be done but have no benefit for political parties<br/>\n Reservations should not be more than 50%<br/>\n Poor from forward castes and minorities should have access to reservations (but as it is already 50% so politically suicidal to redistribute)<br/><br/>The reason for my support is the higher education in most government colleges in India is highly subsidized so should be for only intelligent few or for some social purpose(nor is it sustainable). Governments should not be deciding who and what should be useful and it is best for market to decide.  Government's role should be of enabler of private education and guardian of student's interest .

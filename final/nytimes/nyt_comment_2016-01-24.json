If the ads simply said, e.g., \"no white males need apply, we already have people who look like you,\" at least it would be honest. We would no longer be treating people as we would never consent to be treated ourselves - being unemployed, seeing a job we'd love to have, getting our hopes up, putting great time and effort into applying for it, not knowing the whole time that we have no chance of getting it because of the race and/or gender into which we were born. <br/><br/>If Ms. Gay is going to insinuate that social justice demands proportional representation by race and ethnicity across the board, I look forward to her advocacy of such a law.

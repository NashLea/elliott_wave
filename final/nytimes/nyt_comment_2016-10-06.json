Decades of research after the Charney report have not reduced the range of climate sensitivity estimates; they have increased it, from 2-4 deg C/2X CO2 to 1.5 to 4.5 deg C/2X CO2. <br/><br/> I see Lindzen calculates &lt; 1 deg C/ 2X CO2, whereas the most whacko models in the CMIP-5 figure 4.7 deg C/2X CO2. <br/><br/>Does that not constitute a bit of uncertainty? <br/><br/>According to Ch 9 of the UN IPCC's AR5, climate models using the same input do not predict SAT within + or - 3 deg C, with the multi-model mean well above observations. Yet we are required to believe that \"climate change\" is \"settled science\"? <br/><br/>I think not. <br/><br/>Or consider the \"social cost of carbon.\" I see numbers ranging from McKittrick's -$5/tonne (a net benefit) to Stern-type numbers on the order of $110/tonne. <br/><br/>I bit of uncertainty there, would you not agree? <br/><br/>Our host Andy has said many times that the best scientists are convinced that SOMETHING will happen due to added CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the magnitude and timing of that something remain uncertain. <br/><br/>It is the uncertainty on the pace, magnitude and nature of climate change due to added anthropogenic CO2 that makes this a \"wicked problem\", in Andy's words. <br/><br/>I agree. <br/><br/>I see many stupid renewable energy schemes pushed forth out of panic over CAGW. <br/><br/>These are counter-productive.

If there are two players that answer to that description, one is named Damon and the other Matsui.  We have problems and they are likely to become much more apparent as the season ripens.  We no longer have the best closer in the game, even if we do have the best closer of all time.  As for Joba, he has only two modes of operation: As a strike out machine (rarely) and as a game-loser (no rarely).  As for Thames, the question is not whether he has an adequate arm; the question is whether -- with everyone healthy -- he turns out to be as good as anyone else we might stick in right field.  Is anyone encouraged by the fact that Cervelli and Gardener are the players we're likely to put most of our trust in these days?  And then someone like Thames?  Yes, we all know that Teix and A-Rod will come around; or at least we all believe it.  But Jeter is probably past it and Mariano is getting there.  I say all this as an optimist, tamed by realism.

For 4, the maximum number of ribs is 9, starting at cm 2.  Composite number sized screens give less coverage than any of their factors so optimal screen lengths are always prime.<br /><br />2) The n-th rib is grilled by all screens with length that divides n.  Since factors occur in pairs, this will make an odd number for non-square numbers (since there is no grill of size 1).  For square numbers, the square root sized grill is not paired, giving an even number of grills cooking any square numbered rib.<br /><br />3)<br />A) If the grills have sizes p_1,...,p_n, the grill pattern repeats with period p_1*...*p_n.  So, you will get perfectly matched pieces for a length 2*p_1*...*p_n, or 2*(2*3*5*7)=420 for a four grill snake barbecue.<br /><br />B)  If you allow mirror image pieces to match (so grilled ribs ABC match CBA), then by symmetry a snake of length p_1*...p_n will have all matching pieces except the one in the center.  In the case of the four grill barbecue, this would correspond to a snake of length 210, in which Harry got the 3 rib segment 104-105-106.<br /><br />4)<br />A) The longest sequence of cooked ribs for a 5 grill snake is 13, for grills the sizes of the first 5 primes 2,3,5,7,11.<br /><br />B) Assuming that the optimal grill sizes will be the n smallest primes, we can approach this computationally as follows:<br /><br />Given primes p_1,...,p_k, the associated grill pattern repeats every p_1*...*p_k.  Since any other prime q is relatively prime to p_1*...*p_k, on an infinite length snake every possible orientation of grill q relative to grill collection p_1,...,p_k will occur.  Therefore we can remove the requirement that all grills start at 0, and reduce the problem to finding relative orientations of the n grills to cover as many integers as possible starting from 1 and moving up.<br /><br />So, given n grills, we will pick an ordering of our grills.  Starting from rib 1, we will pick the next grill and orient it to cover the rib, and move to the next.  Every time we reach the next uncooked rib, we will use the next grill, until all the grills are used up.<br /><br />So, to find the longest sequence of cooked ribs, we look for the ordering of grills that will cook the largest number of consecutive ribs under this algorithm, reducing our search space to n! for n grills, rather than p_1*,...,p_n.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is still too large to search exhaustively, so I could only compute an upper bound.  I found that grills with the sizes of the first 18 primes cover at least 107 consecutive segments, whereas best arrangement of 17 I found covers only 99.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1473122, "replies": [], "lft": 34, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/opinion/19dowd.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2004016, "rgt": 35, "userDisplayName": "MESM", "createDate": "1274241098", "userID": 19597155, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1274247036", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Houston, TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1274243436", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "Mid-aged, smart, successful, leader, kid-free, spouse-free-- in actuality, this combination of descriptors is a disturbingly decent statistical predictor of gender.

Something of an anomaly, not a profound anomaly-- I know there are plenty of successful Ms.s who do have.  Still, many studies show that for men, work \"success\" (variously defined, but usually from position and salary) strongly correlates with marriage and children.  For women it does not, or even slightly anticorrelates.  I recall one study where the numbers were done up for business men and women earning high pay (can't remember the exact definition, but the number of participants was large enough to support conclusions) where 95% of the men had kids but only 45% of the women.

It pretty much covers only one cause of hearing loss--noise. The reality is that hearing loss is caused by many different things. Ten percent of white Caucasians are afflicted with otosclorosis. That's a lot of people to overlook. Otosclorosis is the abnormal growth of bone or calcification on the middle ear stapes bones. It is a progressive disease with progressive hearing loss, usually in both ears. The growth on those tiny bones prevent their movement. Movement of those bones is imperative for hearing. The condition affects male and female but is predominantly female. No one knows the cause and there is no cure, only hearing aids and/or surgery can help but doesn't cure. <br/><br/>An overlooked cause for many many health problems, disorders and diseases is hypothyroidism that is not treated sufficiently. Too bad I'm not a medical doctor or researcher. If I were I would achieve fame for medical breakthroughs. Under-treated Hypothyroidism is a root cause of otosclorosis hearing loss. The hypothyroid medical establishment which basks in accolades is the cause of this problem for several generations now. Hypothyroidism is one of the most complex and devastating diseases. There are more or less 28 million cases in the U.S., mostly women by far. Ninety-Nine percent of the doctors in this field are incompetent, and despite the existing science and facts, keep their hypothyroidism patients under-replaced (under-treated).

However, no one in the world knows what causes  diabetes. There are approximately the same number of people with diabetes as there are with hypothyroidism.

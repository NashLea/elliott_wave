Here they are:<br />Ball 5: 1.4055<br />Composite Balls 1-4: 0.1312<br /><br />In this model (detailed in my posts #90 and #92), I assumed that all the balls come together forming one single temporary object as a result of a shock wave that ejects the last ball. The remaining composite object of balls 1-4 then comes apart into its constituent balls simultaneously, each ball sharing the velocity equally. However, that is a very unrealistic assumption. It's much more likely, as Gary pointed out in #100, that the separation occurs in the middle. Imagine the 4 balls connected by 3 springs with some residual tension still left. It's likely that the middle spring that releases first as it has only one spring on each side to push against, while the others have two.<br /><br />If we assume this to be true, and calculate how the velocity of the four-ball composite (0.1312) will be divided between the two halves, conserving momentum and kinetic energy, here is what we get:<br /><br />Balls 1 and 2: velocity = 0.1205<br />Balls 3 and 4: velocity = 0.1476<br /><br />Here's a verification that the numbers are correct and that momentum and kinetic energy are preserved for the split:<br /><br />Original composite momentum (Ball 1-Ball 4 at 0.1312) = mv = 5*0.1312 = 0.66<br />Final momentum (Balls 1 and 2 at 0.1205: Balls 3 &amp; 4 at 0.1476) = 3*0.1205 + 2*0.1476 = 0.66<br /><br />Original kinetic energy = 0.5mv^2 = 0.5*5*(0.1312)^2  = 0.043<br />Final kinetic energy = 0.5*3*(0.1205)^2 + 0.5*2*(0.1476)^2 = 0.043<br /><br />So the final theoretical velocities for our model of the Newton's Cradle - impact causing single object that ejects the last ball and then splits down the center are as follows (adjusted velocities for first ball of mass 2.06 as determined from Bill Gottesman's video measurements in #101, are in parentheses):<br /><br />Ball 1: 0.12 (0.12)<br />Ball 2: 0.12 (0.12)<br />Ball 3: 0.15 (0.15)<br />Ball 4: 0.15 (0.16)<br />Ball 5: 1.41 (1.34 possibly underestimated due to slightly off-center hit)<br /><br />This extremely simple model fits the measurements exceedingly well, without ad hoc assumptions. The velocities are uniquely determined by the three natural assumptions of the model - that all the balls come together, ball 5 is ejected and then the composite of balls 1-4 splits down the center.<br /><br />It works pretty well, and seems to be substantially correct. The test would be to see whether different ball sizes and configurations give equally good predictions.<br /><br />So to answer the original question, the answer is A - only one ball flies off. The pairwise collision model does not work.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2199441, "replies": [], "lft": 106, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/nyregion/17nyc.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3040537, "rgt": 107, "userDisplayName": "WKH", "createDate": "1292561661", "userID": 2799012, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1292563933", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Vermont", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1292563933", "commentSequence": 29, "commentBody": "And what difference would it have made if we had Wikileaks in 1973 ?<br /><br />Would knowledge of this grave ethical lapse of conscience caused the public to rise up and change anything ?<br /><br />Are we doing anything now even about something as basic as passing a budget ?<br /><br />Our representative democracy is failing becxause with or without the truth, we may not think like Kissinger but as a socirty we act like it.

I don\u2019t understand why people feel this country is the \u201cGreat Protector\u201d of Jews, Cambodians, Sudanese, Armenians, etc..   All of these tragedies and many more we have stood witness to as a Nation.   We have never been proactive on that front and it may in fact best be addressed from a multi-lateral position.

So much for the humanity of Jews is anyone still thinks there is any after the way they have treated the Arabs, with of course the undying help of the U.S.  To venerate Kissenger for his assistance to Israel is to further point up the fact that the worse enemy of Israel are those who defend it in the face of the daily horrors they carry out every day against the Arabs. Israel is, along with the U.S. the enemy of mankind, and the world knows it. As terrible as the Holocaust was, it cannot continue to be used to justify the barbaric treatment Israel's of other people.

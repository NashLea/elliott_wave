When WWII ended, 68 years ago this month, the population was 150 million and the housing deficit was 6 million units. Rosie the Riveter and GI Joe got married in their millions with nowhere to live. Construction boomed and thrifts, with the backstop of the Federal Home Loan Banks and the GSEs provided the financing. This worked well during the 50s but began to fall apart during the Great Inflation of the 70s. Money market funds killed the thrifts, whose advantage of paying interest on balances was lost, with some leaping into the flames of the FSLIC disaster.<br/><br/>In the meantime, however, the national housing shortage became a surplus, albeit one that did not comport well with white flight. By the end of the 90s, cheap money and seemingly endless property appreciation cemented the idea \"my home is my ATM.\" <br/><br/>The multiple causes of the burst included a chain of incentives where seemingly everyone made money off the same transaction and up front.

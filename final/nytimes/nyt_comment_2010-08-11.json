Usually it's looked at the other way around- the great back who makes a mediocre offensive line look good. I'm going to have to think about it a bit. Suffice it to say that any running back operating behind a great line had better be getting it done or else he will be quickly replaced.<br /><br />First, though, allow me an historical comment on the use of the 40 time...<br /><br />Determining the provenance of football innovation in a tricky business. As Joe Gibbs says in Tim Layden's new book, \"Blood, Sweat and Chalk\":  \"You'll never hear me say I was the first to do anything, because there's a pretty good chance somebody did it before me, but nobody knows about it.\"<br /><br />It's generally accepted that using 40 yards as the standard timing distance was one of Paul Brown's many contributions to the game. Brown used it at training camp with players who were already on the roster to determine who were the fastest over the distance of a typical punt.<br /><br />Brown was also the first coach to employ a full-time advance scout, Red Conkright, the first to pay his assistants enough so they could work on football year-round, and the first to use psychological testing on players.<br /><br />The 40 time was initially used in the process of scouting potential draftees, and became part of the general football vocabulary, in the early 1960s. Gil Brandt, the Cowboys' long-time Vice President of Player Personnel, and ever-available quote machine, has always claimed they were the first to use it, in 1961.<br /><br />In those days, before the formation of the scouting services BLESTO, United, and Quadra, and before the advent of the Combine in the 80s, the scouts would go on the road with a stopwatch, a tape measure, and a portable scale.<br /><br />After he tracked down the player somewhere on campus, the scout would get accurate measures for his height and his weight, and then mark off 40 yards anywhere nearby. That could be on the local field or even in the closest parking lot.<br /><br />It wasn't exactly a scientific process. In 1975 Russ Francis ran a 4.6 for the scouts barefoot, in jeans. Thinking he'd just rolled out of bed, those scouts were amazed. Of course, Francis didn't tell them he'd been working out for an hour and an half before running and training for a month before that.<br /><br />The 40 time has value, but it should never be dispositive. The time can vary widely, depending on the method used (hand or machine timing), the type of surface on which the test is conducted, and whether the athlete has experience in running sprints. Today, prior to the Combine, many players will undergo extensive training with track and field professionals to try to reduce their time. Those hundreths of a second could mean hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars.<br /><br />More importantly, track speed is not football speed. The 40 is run at full speed in a straight line. In football, you're running at full speed while simultaneously responding to various external stimuli: the flight of the ball, the roar of the crowd, the interaction of the other players on the field. When asked many years ago to compare Lynn Swann to Mikhail Baryshnikov, Roy Blount, Jr. famously said: \"I know Baryshnikov is great, but I'd like to see him dance while somebody's trying to stop him.\"<br /><br />Jerry Rice is a good example of the limits of the 40 time. He ran a 4.59 at the Combine at Arizona State in 1985, marginal speed for a starting N.F.L. wide receiver (4.59 is Walsh's time. Brandt recently said Rice ran 4.66). However, in addition to his many other attributes, Rice's football speed was as great as anybody who's ever played. Many defensive backs who had faster times in the 40 just chased Rice over the goal line.<br /><br />The 49ers traded with the Patriots to move up to the sixteenth spot to get a chance to draft one of the top three receivers available that year: Al Toon from Wisconsin, Eddie Brown from Miami, and Rice, from Miss. Valley State. The pick was effectively made for them as Toon went to the Jets at ten and Brown was selected by the Bengals at 13. Would Walsh have still taken Rice if Brown or Toon, or both, were still on the board?<br /><br />Many football people don't need a 40 time to know who's fast and who isn't. However, when you watch one of those pro days you'll often see a bunch of scouts standing around in a big group with their index fingers poised and ready. I've often wondered what would happen if you took away all of their stopwatches. I think some of them would become disoriented and faint.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1739075, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2384506, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Titopoet", "createDate": "1281502471", "userID": 46621175, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281513216", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "spokane Valley", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281509616", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "What an ugly post, but therein lies its beauty, skin deep and eternal.", "recommendationCount": 18}, {"assetID": 1739075, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2384586, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "JustinV", "createDate": "1281504263", "userID": 60667580, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281513251", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Washington, DC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281509651", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "\"(to kalon: neither masculine nor feminine but neutral, like Madame Sartre\u2019s ephemeral angel, gender indeterminate) \"<br /><br />Hate to be pretentious, but to kalon is not \"neutral\"--it's a substantifized (ie. nounified) neuter adjective.

Yet both beauty and ugliness need defenses, one from excessive praise, the other from the implicit criticism of those possessing some degree of the former.  The photogenically-challenged are in many ways disabled in society, especially in this country with its bias towards airbrushed complexions and surgically enhanced attributes.  Who among us has not known someone who could only be described, charitably, as \"average\" and who possessed, instead of loveliness of looks, a uniquely vibrant personality or wonderful sense of humor or, worse, a \"can-do spirit\"?  Ugliness of countenance is another intense source of pressure on the need to attract the attention necessary to procreate or to leave some original aspect of ourselves behind after our short tour of life.  I'm reminded of the short, homely and hopelessly hyper-religious Austrian, Anton Bruckner, a composer of symphonies of monumental heft and transcedent harmonies, who desperately proposed marriage to any barmaid who looked into his eyes longer than a glance.  If he were a composer of successful film scores today, he could probably procure a trophy wife but the argument in this article seems to be that one probably has a better chance of creating masterpieces (or deep systems of philosophy) if one were not so very easy of the eyes.  Would Bruckner have thought so?  Even though societies have rewarded and honored the great thinkers and creators despite their looks, they have also always favored those with physical beauty regardless of their talents - or lack thereof, to wit, Paris Hilton. Is that unfair?  Because of her native beauty and inherited wealth, she does not have to live an \"underground\" existence that so many, by dint of their appearance, are essentialy condemned to live.  Like Ralph Ellison's invisible man, we don't see them - unless they wave the flag of their distinctive talent or they make the news the hard way, they are off our radars. That's the sadness of our obsession with beauty.", "recommendationCount": 101}, {"assetID": 1739075, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2384645, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "salgadoce", "createDate": "1281505859", "userID": 45670735, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281513295", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "North America", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281509695", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "I agree that phenomenological studies are important, but you kind of lost me when you started talking about dirty old men trying to pick up chicks.<br /><br />I suspect that the reason ugliness is tied to the self-improvement of the self-conscious has more to do with the fact that being conscious of one's own faults - whether they be physical, or emotional, or intellectual - brings suffering, which in turn causes more consciousness, more questioning, more deliberation; in short, more mental activity.<br /><br />I think that any condition or situation that makes you suffer or brings you increased mental anguish can can be useful in the sense that it provides your intellect with the fuel or 'raw material' it needs to expand from its current phenomenological boundaries.<br /><br />For example, I have always thought that people that struggle (and suffer) with who they are or what their identity entails (e.g., people struggling with sexual identity) are often brighter than someone who does not have this particular crisis of identity; the torment, the anguish, the uncertainty - all this acts as fuel for the mind.<br /><br />(Whether this is ultimately a good or bad thing, that society places this type of burden upon certain individuals, I wouldn't pretend to know) ", "recommendationCount": 90}, {"assetID": 1739075, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/the-phenomenology-of-ugly/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2384689, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "NN Ojha", "createDate": "1281507758", "userID": 60812772, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281513308", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Delhi", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281509708", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "The original self-conscious, slightly despairing glance together with the question \"is that ALL\" or \"is this IT\" no doubt is a great enabler not  because it compells us to seek 'improvement' but because it compells us to seek 'answers' and improvement is just an off-shoot, a by-product of the process of seeking answers.

Buddhism is about exploring, observing, not clinging, opening to awareness of living as perhaps we had always shut out, not even being aware to the fact of shutting out.  It is key that we in the West don't yet have the clear, precise vocabulary to discuss and explore the finer aspects of Buddhist understanding.  That means we must not judge or assume.  We must continue to explore and discuss.  In my world, the physical world is tenuous, but not from any concept or idea.  Western language and philosophy/religion hasn't touched that experience, except perhaps in something labeled \"mystical.\"  So the physical is questionable, but not from the mind of existence/nonexistence.

To be sure, this won't win any drama awards, but those that thought it would are clearly confused.  However, this is a super fun farcical comedy with some clever dialog, good staging, and well performed acting.  Cheyenne Jackson as \"Mandrew\" was definitely the star of the show, and showed that he can do good physical comedy as well as deliver his lines with good timing and intonation.  And of course it was fun to see Henry Winkler, who was also well cast in what I think may have been his broadway debut.

I was so hoping that we would do something, maybe not as involved as we were in Libya, but finding a way to be of some assistance. When you think about the problems Syria's government has caused in Lebanon and Israel, its ties to Iran and its potential to roil the whole region, the thought of doing nothing seemed implausible to me. My entire teen experience was filled with fears of the Viet Nam draft catching up with me. As a result of growing up with that experience I have always been very reluctant to support a US involvement in any conflict. However, to some degree the NATO involvement in Bosnia, but mostly the one in Libya, changed my view of the possibilities of helping countries whose people want to remove a despot and wish to enter into a democratic process, by their definition of course. I was not so much angry at our lack of involvement, as I was dismayed. When I try to talk to people about the war in Syria I am equally dismayed at the lack of understanding of what is happening there. I fear that the longer we wait the higher the likelihood that there will be involvement by extremist elements. That we have done so little on even the humanitarian level is astonishing to me. I think we risk the things we fear most by doing nothing.

There is a lot of literature relating to spirituality, personhood and dementia. I have studied it etensively as part of a Mater's degree that I have just completed.

Remember that there will be more boomers retiring than younger folks entering the job market throughout the next fifteen years. The fact that boomers are able to retire at this point is a good sign for the economy. It will also make the unemployment rate look to be improving faster than the economy overall.

You Tube  is perhaps the biggest offender.   They created a platform that encourages users to upload pirated works and profits in the same manner as if they gave it away themselves. They have admitted to 180 million take down's per year.  Now in a market, the lowest price sets the going rate for any good.  And in this case that is $0.

Our political class does not accurately represent the demographically accurate political views of the country.  Specifically, the GOP has used many anti-democratic measures to overcome their inherent minority position of representing the elite capital class and has been in a tight political relationship with evangelicals for over 100 years.  But GOP views on nearly all issues are only supported by a fervent minority, what the GOP sees as their political base.  It is only this explanation that reveals why all GOP candidates would still support this law, because without evangelicals, they are most certainly doomed.  But their failure in thinking is that vocal hardcore evangelicals are the small minority.  Most people in this country are quite tolerant and do not want to see unjust discrimination meted out in society.  So now the entire GOP is standing on a marginally supported and immoral political position, which can only pound them hard in the next election, maybe to the breaking point.  This should be the topic in the media, the silence of the GOP on this important moral issue of our time, and truly that the GOP will go down on the wrong side of history, in its present constitution.", "recommendationCount": 16}, {"assetID": 3425257, "replies": [], "lft": 433, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/sports/in-girls-lacrosse-a-move-in-the-name-of-safety-sparks-debate.html", "parentID": 14565236, "commentID": 14565769, "rgt": 434, "userDisplayName": "Jacob", "createDate": "1427774564", "userID": 28626231, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1427774801", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Washington", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1427771201", "commentSequence": 14565769, "commentBody": "Actually the cause for most injuries in lacrosse is due to the stick that people wield.

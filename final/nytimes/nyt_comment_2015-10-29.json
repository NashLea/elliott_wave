It is a huge problem in this country, and requires specific training for all teachers in order to put a stop to it.  Most of my clients are middle-school-aged boys with a behavior-related disability: ADHD or autism.  Both conditions produce students who are capable academically, but who have a much, much smaller capacity than the rest of us to control emotions, shift their thinking, and communicate under pressure.  The result is an awful lot of non-compliance.  It does require any authority figure to have a very strong ability to stay calm and understand that the defiance is not personal--it's protective.  That is a very hard skill to learn, especially when a person spends every hour of the workday issuing commands and receiving compliance.  The kid with rigid thinking, with frequent emotional overload, embarrassment in front of peers, and who is unable to express his needs or difficulties is not willful in the same way that a teen showing off in front of friends is.  But most teachers don't have the understanding of how their brains are processing the situation or the skills to manage the situation.  So, the kid is punished.  When the first level of punishment doesn't change the behavior (because the kid is still disabled), punishment increases in intensity.  This cycle continues to the level of abuse or arrest.  It happens every day in this country.  It is a huge problem.

The Royals came out for Game 2 with supreme confidence not just for winning the night before but because they hit fastballers like de Grom all the time. The Mets were counting on a \"Cubbie\" showing. When they didn't get it, the longer the game went on without the de Grom strikeouts, and the longer they had trouble hitting Cueto's meatball pitching, when Daniel Murphy started talking to himself in the batter's box (and, big mistake, to the home plate umpire), that's when they let the mind game slip away. <br/><br/>Now, they're back at Citifield where they can regain the mind game edge.

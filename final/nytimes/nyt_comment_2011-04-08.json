Corn is one of the most inefficient biofuel crop you can think of using.  If we converted all of the arable farmland in the U.S. into corn production, the ethanol produced would only be about FIVE PERCENT of our needs - and then there will be no corn (and no doubt other carbo-containing crops) at all for food.  Gasohol also produces LESS energy than gasoline or ethanol alone because each are efficient under substantially different pressure and air mixture conditions - trying to burn both at once lessens the efficiency (stoichiometry) of both of them.  You get less energy and less work out of the mix than either one alone.\r<br/><br/>Look up \"STOICHIOMETRIC GASOLINE ETHANOL\"  It's all verfiable and should show what a scam gasohol (E-90, E-85, etc) truly is.  So WHY are we doing it anyway?\r<br/><br/>I've been saying this for 10 years now and still most people are clueless thanks to the media.  And as already stated, it does indeed take about 1.85 BTUs of energy (mostly petroleum-sourced) to produce 1 BTU's worth of ethanol.  How absolutely stupid is that?  In other words, if you tried to produce corn ethanol using corn ethanol as a production fuel, you'd be out of fuel before the first season.  Sugar beets are indeed around 5-7 times more efficient than corn, but require preciously limited specific latitudes to grow. There isn't enough even globally to ever hope to produce enough.  Even Brazil still imports petroleum and they're ideally situated.\r<br/><br/>The only viable explanation for widespread official promotion of these biofuels is that it will quickly lead to population decimation due to soaring prices, massive food shortages and poverty-related illnesses on a global scale.  I can only surmise it's nothing but the non-war alternative to a population-cutting world war.  Those in big business and government will remain quite comfy and wealthy though - think about that as you open your next scaled-back container of overpriced, manufactured food.

It seems to be a standard tactic used by Republicans to make people believe they can magically obtain the same level of services they get now for less money than is currently spent, proposing some kind of fixed \"voucher\" in place of the bottomless well that characterizes current health care spending. Make a proposal to perhaps establish guidelines that make sure that procedures covered should actually be proven to be useful for a patient and you get accused of rationing healthcare. But establish a static voucher per patient and somehow that is not rationing, instead it's providing incentives to help the \"marketplace\" reduce healthcare costs as if such a free marketplace exists. How about allowing patients to use their vouchers to get healthcare in foreign countries where doctors fees are much lower (as Dean Baker has proposed)? Not likely to see any proposals for that as it would provide too much competition for American doctors and their high paying jobs, but thats how truly free markets would work in healthcare if the Republicans actually believed in capitalism, pity they do not. Vouchers are really a fiscal scoundrel's last resort, as if anyone in the upper classes thinks you can get something for nothing, they know the vouchers are inadequate, just as voucher amounts for education are always inadequate when proposed as a solution for the current state of public education, the goal is not to improve education, just pay as little as you can for the current poor state of affairs. In healthcare the goal is just the same, make sure that the rich with their gold plate plate healthcare plans can get anything they want whenever they want and for the rest of us, well we get just what a voucher will get us and thats that.

He's representing the wealthy voters to whom everyone not one of them is invisible. <br/><br/>Congressman Ryan proposed earlier budgets in which he would have eliminated the health care for children (CHIPS.) His constituents didn't protest. As far as they're concerned, Americans working for a living are lucky to be employed and should have worked harder and studied harder. <br/><br/>His constituents pay to keep him in office because he'll carry their water: make it possible for the strong to prey on those who lack their wealth and connections. It's something the working people in this nation fiercely fought to overcome in the 1930s, 1940s, and even into the 1950s. <br/><br/>I still recall when my father was a petroleum company executive during a refinery strike during my younger years and him telling how he had to low-crawl to his car after his month of working to keep the refinery operating. I remember the wives of the workers in that strike coming to our rural home with their children, and asking for food and toilet paper. I recall my mother answering the door with a revolver in one hand hidden behind her back. I recall us setting up a a pantry in the garage and my mother telling them she couldn't feed them all but would help in emergencies. I recall my father expressing amazement that after low-crawling to the car, the union workers opened the gate and waved him out. I remember his consternation when my mother showed him the garage pantry and explained why they'd waved him out. She said the strike was between the men, and union or not, she'd always share her food with mothers and children. I remember our house being shot at and seeing the bullet holes in the living room window. <br/><br/>I recall one of my father's friends over one evening talking to him about a railroad strike. He told of how union workers had been found along the rail bed beaten black and blue. About that moment he looked up and remarked to my father that \"little ears were nearby\" and he'd better stop or there'd be nightmares. I was sent to bed. <br/><br/>I recall the news stories on WGN radio about acid being thrown into truckers' faces during trucking strikes. <br/><br/>I recall the death threats sent to my parents about kidnapping and killing me. I recall at age 7 people in Halloween masks attacking the windows on my bedroom and I then recall being taken to St. Louis where a large black German Shepherd named Windy and I were trained together for my protection. I recall the annual re-training through my eleventh year. That probably had a lot to do with my father regularly took me overseas with him. <br/><br/>That is the era back to which Congressman Ryan and his bought, phony, grass-root supporters want to take us: the era of real class warfare. It's sick. They're morally corrupt. <br/><br/>From President Truman forward, every Democratic President has reduced the national debt as a percentage of the nation's GDP. Since Truman forward, ONLY TWO Republican Presidents have reduced the nation's debt as a percentage of GDP: President Eisenhower in both terms and President Nixon in his first term. That's it. Since then, Republican Presidents have always increased the national debt as a percentage of GDP. <br/><br/>Congressman Ryan's budget isn't the least bit serious. It's not a budget to build a great nation. It's a delusion concocted by his vanity egged on by the thought of accolades and personal riches from this nation's wealthiest. Congressman Ryan's budget has all the scope, insight, and foresight one might find in the Christmas wish list of a sheltered, spoiled child.

It calls for authoritarian solutions promulgated by hereditary aristocrats and echelons of vested interests and enables them to continue to dump their production costs into our air and water even as they attempt to erase Jefferson from the textbooks. A political party led by the profit motive really has no patriotism, no decency, no foresight and none of the human qualities essential for group survival.

This is part of the ideology to which right-wing Republicans (rwGOP) have been mindlessly genuflecting for 30 years since Reagan and Stockman bought into Freidman\u2019s simplistic economic models\u2014apparently, to make the mathematics easier, he assumed human behavior, individually and collectively as a society, has no effect on economics and, hence, could be excluded as factors from his models.  Apparently, Friedman also didn\u2019t study Forrester (MIT), who showed in the 60\u2019s that a predictive model is no better than it\u2019s underlying assumptions.  For Friedman, that was a ludicrous omission, too.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the rwGOP has relentlessly pursued \u201cfree market\u201d and deregulation ideology as though human greed, avarice, insecurity, ego, success, failure, desire for power, wealth, and control doesn\u2019t matter\u2014that it\u2019s all somehow disconnected from the relationship between government, business, social services and safety nets.   Consequently, we are possibly facing the worst economic crisis in this country\u2019s history, the Great Depression notwithstanding,  Only trained Shamen should practice Voodoo, which the rwGOP are not\u2026.<br/><br/>But that\u2019s not a serious issue to the rwGOP\u2014actually, they like it this way: the rwGOP advances their political agenda by using and abusing economic instability, vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cThe Shock Doctrine\u201d <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/7-9780312427993-2\" title=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/7-9780312427993-2\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.powells.com/biblio/7-9780312427993-2</a> ; using disinformation and lies; creating Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt; and, for all practical purposes, waging economic warfare against the U.S. Government and 97% of the American people.<br/><br/>So, of course, neither can Ryan\u2019s budget be remotely serious: the rwGOP agenda (and budget proposal) is far removed from one designed to restore America\u2019s economic strength.<br/><br/>Why? Their entire political agenda promotes \u201cliberty\u201d and deregulation to rape the planet, eliminate American rights and protections, and devolve the American Democratic Republic, by and for the people, into a plutarchy, by and for the extremely wealthy and corporations--all for limitless irresponsibility, destructiveness, power, and unbridled, greedy profiteering, without consequences. <br/><br/>Consider the $61 Billion in budget cuts the rwGOP is using to threaten to shut-down the U.S. government: the deficit is about $1.3 Trillion ($1,300 Billion); and the debt is about $14.2 Trillion ($14,200 Billion).  Simple arithmetic:  100 x $61Billion / $1,300Billion    =   4.7% of the deficit; and  100 x $61Billion / $14,200Billion =   0.43% of the debt.  No matter how you look at it, cutting the budget by $61Billion has virtually no meaningful fiscal impact on government operations, budget deficit or debt.  Imagine that!  That\u2019s the same impotent impact on the debt and deficit as extending the Bush tax cuts and enabling corporations such as G.E. to claim $3.2Billion in tax refunds on $14.5 Billion in profits.   <br/><br/>What is the impact?  $61Billion in cuts facilitates undermining women\u2019s rights, undermining education and teachers, Planned Parenthood, NPR, rejecting knowledge-based action (such EPA, DOE, climate change science), and undermining beneficial governmental services the rwGOP glibly perceive as \u201csocialism\u201d or \u201cbig government\u201d.<br/><br/>It\u2019s all just part of the big picture the rwGOP have been painting for 30 years since Reagan.<br/><br/>It's discouraging to witness the rwGOP attack America, so here\u2019s a bit of humor that Dr. Krugman didn\u2019t include in his Op-Ed:  A portion of the rwGOP\u2019s budget cuts is the reduction of  military spending by a whopping 0.00357 percent (that\u2019s 0.0000357) of the entire annual defense-related budget.   Small think at its best--appropriate for typically small-minded and petty right-wing Republicans.<br/><br/>Vote the right-wing Republicans out of political existence. That will have by far the greatest positive impact on America and our economy, including deficit and debt reduction.  <br/><br/>Vote Democrat or moderate Republican in 2012.<br/><br/>Meanwhile support recall campaigns across the nation to remove right-wing Republicans from elected office.<br/><br/>29,000,000 registered voters, who voted for Obama in 2008, did not vote on Nov 2nd, 2010 (stat from Huffington Post). Let's hope that the rwGOP\u2019s now blatant in-your-face hypocrisy, fraudulence, and false 2010 campaign advertising, as evidenced in their state and U.S. legislative actions, will serve as a wake-up call to all the people who cynically believe their vote doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Their apathy and cynicism enables right-wing fascism and treason to take root in America.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/opinion/03dowd.html?permid=43#comment43\" title=\"http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/opinion/03dowd.html?permid=43#comment43\" target=\"_blank\">http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/opinion...</a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.restore-integrity.info\" title=\"http://www.restore-integrity.info\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.restore-integrity.info</a>", "recommendationCount": 840}, {"assetID": 2609813, "replies": [], "lft": 212, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/opinion/08krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3658303, "rgt": 213, "userDisplayName": "Robert Watson", "createDate": "1302237583", "userID": 21251729, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302240611", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302237011", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "\"The G.O.P. budget plan isn\u2019t a good-faith effort to put America\u2019s fiscal house in order; it\u2019s voodoo economics, with an extra dose of fantasy, and a large helping of mean-spiritedness.\"\r<br/><br/>It's exactly what you'd expect from the Republican Party, a party that has morphted from ignorance and greed to outright evil.\u2003 \r", "recommendationCount": 563}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

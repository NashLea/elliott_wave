Does anyone have any doubt? Most of the fees imposed by banks are paid by a small minority of customers. What does that tell us, class? Those customers are used and exploited while they last and, should bankruptcy or other forces intervene, they are cast out of the banking system where they will...wind up paying fees (higher ones) to payday lenders, check cashing stores and the whole bottom dwelling exploitation industry that operates on the edges of small towns and in the rougher sections of cities next to liquor stores and the occasional strip joint. <br/><br/>During the years of the Bush administration, acting on what they had gleaned from decades previous, the banks discovered they were in charge. They could impose almost any fee and get away with it. A returned check fee went from ten dollars to thirty five dollars, pure profit. The ATM machine, which probably costs pennies per transaction, went from a fifty cent fee to three fifty for out of bank customers. That's almost all pure profit. Everything now has a fee attached and the (bad) example of the banks spread to the airlines and is creeping through the American economy like a cancer. One book I read in the last year about predatory lending and the mortgage crisis quoted a bank worker as saying that he believed the new game in American business was simple: rob the poor.<br/><br/>Banks around here, including the notorious Bank of America, have started charging a five dollar fee to cash a check DRAWN ON THAT BANK in payment by a customer to non-customer of the bank. If someone should write a check for ten dollars, it would cost 50% of that check to cash it. They get away with it because they assume they are dealing with a weak customer who doesn't have another account to deposit the check. They rob the customer with a smiling face and \"have a good day!\".<br/><br/>Why have customers allowed it? In major cities, there are virtually no more \"friendly neighborhood banks\" like days of old. The people who work in the banks are shuffled around faster than a deck of cards in Las Vegas on a hot Saturday night. We had a fairly big, old fashioned bank in the DC area for years called Chevy Chase Bank. Even that bank transitioned its services to centralized offices with 800 numbers so the customer could never speak to the same person and, worse, would find nearly impossible to talk to someone at their local branch. Like most banks, Chevy Chase has been swallowed up, in its case by Capital One, a big credit card company. <br/><br/>Permitting banks to merge faster than college students at a Friday night mixer has been, and continues to be, a disaster for America. The big banks think only in terms of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. The little loan of 75,000 that launches a new company means nothing to them. Too much trouble. The paper work, as they say, is the same for 75 million as it is for 75K. So, the big banks pursued schemes that would push massive amounts of money out the door, but not by carefully writing mortgages themselves. Turn that dirty work over to someone else, please. They got back a sludge pile of bad loans, but figured they could then push them off on some other company. It worked, for awhile.<br/><br/>The Republicans are in favor of anything that allows this kind of outright theft to continue. Their \"clients\", after all, at the banks and big business (this is true for the Dems, too, but less so). Naturally, they want to block Warren. So far, Obama has been far more adept at avoiding battles than showing America what he stands for. Now would be a good time to stand up.<br/><br/>In the early part of the 20th century, there was a massive push back against monopolistic practices of \"big business\". Politicians and the public came to realize that the super rich, left to their own devices, would leave nothing on the table for anyone else. The leader of part of this movement was a Republican, Teddy Roosevelt. Where is that consciousness now? We have been put to sleep by academically derived, unproven theories that everything big business does to us is GOOD. The free market system! Meanwhile, those in the system, especially the banks, manipulate it behind the scenes with fevered urgency to get what they want, free markets be damned. Should I say we need a new awakening to what is happening?<br/><br/>Doug Terry<br/>\n<a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 2838531, "replies": [], "lft": 414, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/opinion/11nocera.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3979095, "rgt": 415, "userDisplayName": "steve", "createDate": "1307802603", "userID": 50897344, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1307852552", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "nyc", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1307848952", "commentSequence": 240, "commentBody": "Mr. Obama will never get my vote again, ever.

The biggest frustration I have with Obama is his refusal to take the Republicans to task.

Yet, no one talks about it an no one is willing to call them on it.  <br/><br/>I suppose the one of the reasons is that congressional Democrats are almost as beholden to corporate interests as Republican.  But if they are a casualty, then so be it.  A Democrat in the pocket of the big banks is no better than a Republican one.   <br/><br/>What I want to see is a President that stands up for the American people.  The reason many ordinary Americans are so disillusioned with the government is because they don't feel like government looks out for them anymore.   If Obama demonstrated he has the courage to take on the big banks and the plutocrats, point to the Republican agenda saying \"this is what they stand for\", and stand up for hard-working middle class people, I believe he would be a shoo-in next year.

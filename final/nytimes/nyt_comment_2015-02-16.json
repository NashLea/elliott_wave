How do you judge that? From a single macro figure, such as 0.7% growth for 2014? That is too pale and fragile to translate into substance for a society with one third deep into poverty, another one third collapsing much faster than they can cut expenses. <br/><br/>26% official unemployment (it is more), 25% GDP down the drain, half of the workforce gets paid with delay up to 6 months. Devestment, prices very high compared to wages, despite the deflation. That's because incomes dropped to 2000 levels (pre euro) but prices very much remain in the euro era, where most goods became 200% or 300% expensive overnight. We'll need 30 years of bad poverty to recover.<br/><br/>At the same time, without extra mesaures, Greece has to cut about 5% GDP of public expenses each year up to 2018. That simply is not working. We have faced worst recession and suffered the biggest fiscal adaptation in western history.<br/><br/>It is really hard to live here, and that explains not only the change of government but the unanimous backing of the govt negotiation tactics by 85% of the electorate.

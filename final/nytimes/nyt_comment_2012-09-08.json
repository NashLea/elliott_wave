I would argue that you are correct on both counts: the conventions are a reflection of who we are and a gathering of what is largely a subculture of people active in politics.<br/><br/>Politicians are like actors: they need talent, drive, and public support to be successful.  The public ultimately decides who succeeds based upon the conduct we are willing to tolerate in order to benefit from their talents.  And no one reaches the top without enormous ambition.  No Mr. Smith goes to Washington.  Lincoln was deeply involved in directing his surrogates to cut the deals necessary to assure his nomination.  I'm sure that Washington was active in his own selection as president.<br/><br/>Like actors, politicians are supported by people and organizations with a vital interest in their success.  These circles do whatever it takes to ensure public support for their champion.  A hundred years ago, it was pamphlets and payoffs to whoever could deliver the votes.  Today, it's pretty much the same except the pamphlets have evolved into expensive, sophisticated media campaigns and the payoffs are promises to those who can finance them.<br/><br/>Yet the goal is always the same: to win over enough public support.  We have always been aware of and tolerated varying degrees of sliminess.  So, yes, most of us don't go into politics, but we acquiesce in the system.  It's our choice and says something about who we are.<br/><br/>Nothing prevents us from pushing for change except the will to make the effort."}]}, "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/opinion/collins-convention-pop-quiz.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7071228, "rgt": 25, "userDisplayName": "Robert Lion", "createDate": "1347077115", "userID": 59931919, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1347077174", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Connecticut", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1347073574", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "I wonder if these conventions were an accurate reflection of who and what we are as a nation. Our reps on display, our work as voters fully realized and materialized on a fantastic stage for all to see. Right? Or, are these conventions only a showcase of those people who somehow never lost their desire to pursue a career in a profession many of us grew to loath?<br/><br/>If that's the case, then we have what amounts to a sub-culture representing the nation; a sub-culture of those who didn't turn their backs on politics, but instead somehow navigated through the morass of negativity that justifiably surrounds it. One wonders what type of individual thrives off of what the rest of us cringe over. I wonder if this is the reason we can never seem to relate to the circus that has become American politics.<br/><br/>Sometimes, though, some of the best and brightest do manage to trickle through the rigors of our condemnation and harsh assessment, undeterred, and free to risk his/her neck in an unforgiving and less than sophisticated public arena. But most of those who 'trickle through' as of late, it seems, are not those we can be particularly proud of. For me, these conventions illustrated that more than ever.<br/><br/>Unlike in the past, I had little interest in watching. I felt that they had lost much of their luster. Maybe their magnitude has been diminished by the digital age -- lost in a pool of choices. But maybe it's more simple. Maybe there are just fewer of those who we look forward to seeing.

For one thing, it probably won't work, given the instability of the jet stream and the fact that nobody knows how to go about influencing the climate on that scale. For another, the Russians, who love the fact that the Arctic sea is becoming ice free, won't stand for it.  <br/><br/>Add in the fact that it is extremely unlikely that we will significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions in the needed time frame of, say, ten years, and \u2026 sigh\u2026I think we can figure that we're in for pretty big changes. <br/><br/>What to do next, aside from looking squarely at these realities and letting them soak in, is unclear.

Gardner and Jeter, in the 9 and 1 holes, provide the only opportunity for this team to play small ball, and to put the ball in motion.<br/>\nAbout Granderson, I agree. He's got huge holes in his swing, and certainly can be pitched to. As far as Martin, I'm not sure I agree. Even though he's right on the Mendoza line, he's one of the few Yankee hitters who is (much) better in clutch situations. As one who does not root for the Yankees, Martin is one of the LAST Yankees that I want to see up with the game on the line. As an example, last night, with the O's trying to hang on, he went from 1-2 to working a walk that facilitated Ichiro's hit that tied (for then) the game. In the last game in Tampa, Martin hit the home run that put the Yankees ahead 4-3 in the 7th. That lead didn't hold, but again, Martin was the danger man. I think the Yankees made what used to be a typical George move in trading Austin Jackson (the last 5 tool guy out of the NYY minor league system) AND Phil Coke, who was instrumental in the 2009 WS Championship, for Granderson. Except for power, Jackson is equal to or better than Granderson in all categories, including defense.<br/>\nSabathia carried Milwaukee to the playoffs almost single handedly, and parlayed it into a huge NYY contract, and he was just as good in 09 when the Yanks went the whole post season with only 3 starters.

Texts to drug dealers for instance could be discovered.  Texts and calls to pimps, terrorists, traffickers, all could be discovered.  This would, of course, lead to the law breaking individual thrown behind bars, where he/she belongs, and then begin an investigation to catch the other criminals.  By the time law enforcement is done checking all the cell phones, all the criminals will be gathered up and the United States will become once again a law bidding land.  Think about, a land of law bidding citizens, no drugs, no pimps, no terrorists, no traffickers.

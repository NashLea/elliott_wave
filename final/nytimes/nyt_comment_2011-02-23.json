It was almost trivially easy.<br /><br />However, when I went to look for a job, no one had ever heard of the University of Chicago, but they were totally impressed that I had graduated from UCLA because UCLA had a really good basketball team at the time. This helped me get a higher paying job.<br /><br />This is just an anecdote, but I think that going to an elite school that is not well known rather than a more well known but less elite one only helps in a small number of cases.  In general, I think that, as far as making money goes, a more well known school helps more.<br /><br />This is true even of Ivy league schools.  I live on the West coast, and here the only schools that even very educated people know are Ivies are Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Most have heard of Columbia and Brown, but don't know that they are Ivies.  Many people may have heard of Penn, Dartmouth, or Cornell but would have no idea that they were elite.

However, I agree with previous comments on the comparison with such a program with the workings of a broken child welfare system that places parents rights over childrens rights.<br /><br />The reason many children are placed in multiple homes is, in many cases, due to parents who fail their children over and over again while the court system refuses to grant permanency to these children.  When children are young, it is nearly impossible to terminate rights, in spite of physical or emotional abuse, drug and alcohol use, etc.  A parent receives chance after chance, which extends a child's time in limbo in the system.  Children wind up in residential treatment centers for many reasons, including mental health issues, age, lack of appropriate foster care, and other complex reasons that this article only touches briefly on.  If permanency, safety and positive outcome were stressed early on by the courts, then more children would be in stable homes years before the need to be placed in a residential treatment center.<br /><br />By all means, provide services to parents when this is deemed a workable solution.  However if youth either remain in care for more than two years, or if they are returned to care again and again, then all bets should be off. Someone needs to advocate for the children in these situations and recognize that returning them to a relative is wonderful if they can do it, but not always a viable solution.<br /><br />This program has a very high success rate. This makes me wonder: Are applicants and their families screened prior to participating? I would hope so. And, if this is the case, then the high success rate only means that the families chosen for the in-house services were not being served correctly in the first place under our broken child welfare system.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2438423, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/distressed-t-shirts-for-distressed-mets-fans/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3423906, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "dc", "createDate": "1298437662", "userID": 42999168, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1298438223", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC, Ny", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1298438223", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "I'm sorry, this shirt is both clever and funny.

However, if these services are going to be used for children who have been abused and neglected I would worry that children would remain in danger while services are being implemented.

The \"depraved on accounta I'm deprived\" model (as they say in 'West Side Story') has been alternating with the \"parent-ectomy\" model in a pendulum swing for decades.

Of the two extremes, the \"family unification\" model seems the most delusional in cases of genuine abuse (as opposed to neglect).

What \"services\" can transform a family life built on brutality, degradation, or sexual exploitation? The social work model can accomplish some good, some of the time...but God help children when we refuse to admit the existence of evil. Do I sound cynical? Must be because I just served on a grand jury.

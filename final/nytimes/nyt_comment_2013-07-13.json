We can't afford Social Security, we can't afford Medicare or Medicaid, we can't afford Food Stamps or unemployment insurance, we can't afford rent subsidies - we can't afford any of this \"largesse\" anymore.<br/><br/>The irony is that they have muscled their way into state level political power and are right now while we watch them implementing their plan across the nation in state legislatures, and when they are able to do so, implementing their plan at the federal level, sometimes with the cooperation and co-sponsorship of red state Democrats who want to be re-elected. <br/><br/>All of this under President Obama's watch! A majority of the American people voted for progressive politicians, re-elected Barack Obama, and now we watch as the Republicans' long-held plan to dismantle the social safety net and all our hard-struggled-for progressive programs are trashed by the Republican legislators and the Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices (it's difficult to call them \"justices\" as I see no justice there, just politicians with some perverse notion about the equities of American life and the general welfare).<br/><br/>Our nation, the peoples' democracy, no more."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 9451214, "replies": [], "commentID": 9451836, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Bmcg", "createDate": "1373710764", "userID": 44843112, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1373724387", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 5, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Rima Regas", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Westchester, NY", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1373720787", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "nice use of the word throttle which can connote revving an engine or strangling. i wonder if you meant the double entendre?

That is one motivation behind the right wing's eternal attack on govt.: what they are really seeking is to turn that huge cash machine almost entirely over to private business. The great Ross Perot, who made such a splash 21 yrs. ago as an independent candidate for president, made a good deal of his fortune processing Medicare and Medicaid forms for the federal govt. His company, EDS, handled the outsourcing of this paper processing at a time when the use of main frame computers was considered an exotic function best handled by computer engineers. With this foundation, his empire grew into a multi-billion dollar business. <br/><br/>Most of the misunderstood and hated \"foreign aid\", which represents less than 2% of federal expenditures, actually represents purchasing power for foreign nations to buy US food supplies and other American goods, especially military aircraft, etc. <br/><br/>Let's look at the problem directly: something is terribly wrong in a nation where 23 million people need food assistance. This is a society wide problem, not one limited to the motivations of those without sufficient employment to fully support themselves. If we can't provide anything close to full employment, we need to find out why and take steps to change as a nation, all together, not finding new ways to accuse and fight with each other.

So Obama, in his desperation to mollify the increasingly outraged public while avoiding any actual debate or reform, has managed to find one instance where one of the hand-picked right-wing groupthinking kangaroos on the FISA court hesitated in his appointed duty to quickly rubber-stamp an NSA request. That authorized \"leak\" of a classified ruling was presumably part of his stated effort to make the public \"comfortable\" with limitless NSA surveillance, by showing that the FISA Court is at least occasionally capable of entertaining questions about systemic violations of the privacy of American citizens. <br/><br/>I don't know how many people who worry about the surveillance dragnet are now \"comfortable.\" But the release of this ruling only makes me more uncomfortable, and gives me more reason to distrust anything Obama or Clapper tell us. It hints at the surveillance of Americans being far more extensive than Snowden's disclosures (so far) have suggested. And also that the FISA Court would be powerless to do anything about unlawful surveillance of Americans even if they were inclined to do so. (And, of course, the court is specifically designed to facilitate and legitimize the expansion of the surveillance dragnet rather than to provide any real oversight.) <br/><br/>All this ruling really shows is that it's time to have the debate that Obama pretends to want, but is actually trying to prevent at all costs.

The alternative hypothesis, in support of which there is a vast amount of data, is that different ethnicities vary in mean IQ.

The various IQ tests have been modified for decades in efforts to change these results by doing away with all cultural bias, but the relative rankings remain.  In fact, phsyiolgical measures (reaction time) are highly correlated with IQ and closely reflect the ethnic rankings of traditional pencil and paper tests.<br/><br/>Although no academics are willing to destroy their careers by broaching the subject, these differences have profound social and international implications and must eventually be honestly confronted.

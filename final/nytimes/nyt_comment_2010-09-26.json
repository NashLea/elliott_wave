Since you don't know whether the balance scale will go up or down when the odd ball shows up on a plate, a series of 3 weighings giving 102 with a heavy ball, would have given 201 with a light ball. So, to figure out the total number of combinations you can utilize, you have to exclude all equivalent ones. If you look at the 3 cases at #51 for 2, 3 and 4 weighings, they all respond to that definition and work correctly to produce the correct ball.<br />A longer explanation for two weighings. 9 combinations are possible 00, 01, 02, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22. Now we exclude 4 combinations: 02 because complementary of 01; 20 because complementary of 10; 21 because complementary of 12; 22 because complementary of 11. We are left with 5 combinations 00, 01, 10, 11, 12, which really means either them or their complementary. 00 is a perfectly valid combination: if the ball labeled 00 is heavier or lighter, since it doesn't appear neither in the first weighing not in the second, the plates will be level both times, from which you get the reading 00; et voila' you have your label pointing at exactly the only ball that could have given even plates both times: the one that was never weighed. There is one very important condition to be respected though. You need to have an equal number of 1's and 2's for each weighing, and you will notice that in the sequence 00, 01, 10, 11, 12 there are three 1's at the first digit and no 2's. Therefore you have to find a way of turning one of those 1's into a 2 to get an even number of 1's and 2's. Things are complicated by the second digit where two 2's and a 1 appear. Fortunately any combination is associated to its complementary, which is not being used by any other ball. Let's see the complementary labels associated with the same ball together: 00, (01-02), (10-20), (11-22), (12-21).  Pretty quickly you can sort out whether to use the the first or second label in parenthesis, and keep the counting of 1's and 2's even for the same digit. I've come up with two possibilities: 00, 01, 20, 21; or 00, 01, 10, 22. Both of these two last choices work to detect the odd ball. It gets a little more involved when you have to produce the combinations for 3 weighings and 4 weighings, but the principle is still valid. Just run a pencil-and-paper simulation with the label combinations I posted at #51, and I think they should work correctly.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1887888, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/yankees-getting-rotation-in-order/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2592904, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "wlp", "createDate": "1285473949", "userID": 2076390, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1285474435", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "mandeville, LA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1285470835", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "Wonderful.

Well, I'm kind of young (20, just finish undergrad, going to med school), and I can tell you (at least where I lived), school from K-12 is just stacked against boys (I'm male btw). The double standards are ridiculous. I was an energetic, eager, smart young boy growing up in elementary school, yet our teachers decided that more than half of the boys in the class (including me) were so unmanageable that they would always have to have detention or go on ritalin (my mom had to talk them out of it!).  If a girl acted like a boy though, she got endless praise for being \"assertive\" and \"strong\". In middle school and high school, when girls started doing worse in science and math, there was an uproar and girls only remediation classes were started before and after school to help them in science and math. Yet in my area, when the boys started failing in those fields (at a higher rate than the girls were before), there was an outcry against giving boys only remedial classes in the maths and sciences. And then when I went to engineering school, girls were allowed to get in with FAR lower scores (it was publicly known, to remedy fewer girls in engineering), and ALL girls got ridiculous scholarships than were denied to the boys; meaning a 3.0 girl could get $30000 scholarship more than a 4.0 boy in college.  Also, there was a TON of money in my college for women's only programs, involving free career advice, talks with executive women, free food, etc. Most women in my college got jobs through these things - yet there's no equivalent programs for boys. Hell, if I even got interviewed by a male company spokesman with another male student there would be a rally against \"the old boys club\". Now I somehow made it into medical school, and STILL it appears to have double standards. From what I've seen, male doctors with kids are ALWAYS, without exception, expected to a) pick up the slack and b) NOT be compensated every time their female counterparts with kids go home and leave THEIR patients with the male docs. It's ridiculous - the male docs end up working far more and get the same or less pay; and are NOT allowed to argue.  I cringe now when moms (of only daughters) say \"wow my daughter is so successful in this patriarchal system thats stacked against girls!\". Well, I'd them you to live in the shoes of a school age boy, or at least see what moms of young sons have to deal with.  It'd be incredibly eye opening.

How is the ability of girls to be free to take on traditionally male or female tasks and roles \"a reminder of the second class nature of women\" rather than the oppression of boys and men who are boxed in by traditional sterotypes?<br /><br />Because I think what boxes them in is that males are taught to dread being females, because females are not viewed as \"as good\" as men. Women today are not taught that. It's unfair to boys and girls but I absolutely think it derives from a feeling that women are less than men. I hardly think that this is an \"insane\" view.<br /><br />And how was my first comment, that there is, contrary to what a prior poster said, no \"trend\" torwards fewer male elementary schools somehow \"unfair\" to a mom of boys.

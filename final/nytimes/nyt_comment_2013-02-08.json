Not a word on investing in our economy to create jobs, by using fiscal policy as even Republican Ben Bernanke has been saying for years.<br/><br/>I read op-editorialist Scott J. Brown yesterday, arguing in Room for Debate that defense spending cuts have a high multiple, meaning that every dollar cut from defense spending may subtract $2 from the overall economy!  The fact that weaponized Keynsianism hides itself behind made-up words like multiple, instead of multiplier, with unsupported scary 2-for-1 loss predictions, was disconcerting.  <br/><br/>This kind of weaponized Keynsianism, that dares not speak it's name, displaces the more proven multiplier effects of stimulation directly at aimed at increasing demand.  It gives cover to politicians who want to ignore multipliers proven by history and acknowleged by the IMF.  It's like Republican ranting that that  public spending always displaces private spending (jobs), even when the FED cannot lower interest rates. And obscures that stimulating economic growth and job creation is far less important to deficit hawksters, than upward redistribution of tax dollars.<br/><br/>But for Dr. Krugman to be telling us our best action is not to demand revenue and stimulus, but to just try to keep the deficit hawksters at bay, that's what's really scary.

This article and many of the comments are over focused on the possibility that  a practitioner might label a person as ill, as if that was a matter of opinion. The plain truth is that sufferers come to us. Thhey know they're ill. They know they don't want to suffer further. Whereas, it can be palliative to a degree, to normalize their pain (ie; explaining the average course of grief), often that's not enough. Many of these comments seem to assert that the lion share of pain is coming from a belief on the part of the sufferer that they ought not be in pain. Hence they are abnormal. This is ridiculous. The pain of depression is as real as the pain of a toothache. Its not anyone's (psychiatrist, philosopher, etc...) job to judge the validity of that pain based on prevalence, causation, social values, etc... The job's to fix it.

Fewer employees or benefits or wage reduction or ... will be necessary. Are most nursing home staff overpaid, provided costly pension and health care benefits? Doubtful.

We can say that in principle, we would expect this to be the case. If you are spending your own money on yourself, you are going to do it very carefully. If you are spending somebody else's money on yourself, you are also going to be reasonably careful about it. However if you are spending somebody else's money on somebody else (which is what is the case with government), then you have no real incentive to use that money effectively or efficiently and there are many examples from history that bear this out. There is a case for saying that there are certain kinds of spending which are more efficient when carried out by government because of the economies of scale that government possesses. However this is almost always outweighed (I would argue, in fact, always outweighed) by the huge inefficiency costs that come with the less productive public management and the fact that public provision does not face the profit and loss incentives which lead private providers to constantly look to improve the quality of their service and cut out waste and unnecessary costs.<br/><br/>Individuals should have the freedom to  use whatever the fancy for money. Pursuing this course of action may be a little painful in the short-run but what hangover is not painful.

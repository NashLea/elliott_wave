Bubbles almost always begin with an element of truth, which then gets blown far out of proportion.  In the dot-com days the element of truth was that the new internet technology was deeply transformative and was unleashing vast productivity efficiencies and wealth creation.  Now, let's look at China. The economy, while ostensibly growing, is on a steady decline in growth.  Without the tumble in commodity prices last quarter's growth would have been about 6% y.o.y., far below target.  The reality is probably half that number once you remove all of the book-cooking.  In general, the economy is not in good shape.  So, the seed of of China's stock market bubble is simply that the CCP leadership wants a higher stock market.  The belief, up until a few weeks ago, was that the CCP could effect this without end.  Corruption, fraud, and cooked books are rampant in China, so in an economy like that you would expect to have a much lower P/E multiple on the market than in transparent markets with better governance.  So, if the US S&amp;P 500 has a ttm P/E multiple of 20 (granted, on the high side), in relative terms what would I be willing to pay for China's market?  Maybe a P/E of 15.

Mississippi basically outlawed abortion, and millions of people have no access to healthcare because their red state governors are ideologues. <br/><br/>Some states have death penalties, some don't. Some states adopt Obamacare, some don't. Some follow epa guidelines, some flout them. <br/><br/>But in no U.S state would you see seniors lining up in the hot sun to collect their social security while the federal government deliberately refused to capitalize banks.<br/><br/>No state would ever be threatened with being kicked out of the Union, knowing it had no currency of its own and would suffer immense hardship,  because it couldn't balance its budget in an economic crisis. <br/><br/>The E.U is modeled after the U.S.A but it is failing miserably. Only 13 years into the grand Union and they are about to lose the one country whose ancestors developed the moral foundations of the western world. Nice.

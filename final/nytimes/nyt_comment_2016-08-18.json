And the beauty is that the current presidential campaign provides a wonderful opportunity for Hillary to take up the cudgel.<br/><br/>The angry white working class voters who make up a large chunk of Trump's supporters are some of the foremost victims of our horrible health insurance system. They make too much for Medicare but not enough so that health care costs aren't crushing. While I'm under no illusion that many won't vote against their economic self-interest, regardless, the pain is too great for all of them to ignore it. I'd bet Hillary could peel off a lot of their votes if she recognized their plight and offered a solution.<br/><br/>Come-on Hillary! Make single-payer health insurance a centerpiece of your campaign.

Very little, if any, surface and sub-surface coal extracted in TN, KY, WV goes to create energy in these same states.  So why is this, you ask?  Because the coal extracted is not clean coal, and the mining operations are all private sector.  So where do these same states get the clean coal to burn in their power plants, you ask?  Answer:  from the western states, through TVA, whose mining operations are owned by...you guessed it!  The federal government!  The states have no control over and cannot prevent the feds from pricing the private sector out of the mining industries.  And this article has the temerity to ask who should pick up the pieces.

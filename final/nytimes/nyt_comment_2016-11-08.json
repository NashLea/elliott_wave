It amazes me that even after more than 50 years, American media still puts Boomers in the predictable bracket. I suppose given the fact that the usual assumption that people are as two dimensional as media and its very brief attention spans is also rather predictable. <br/><br/>Just remember that the Boomers were the first to go outside the ancient system that doesn't work at all now and barely worked back then. The counterculture was quite real, and functional. <br/><br/>The main reason for overall regression on all subjects is that the media allows these primitive cave dwellers space on TV and the net. If you don't like ancient genocidal planet-destroying crocks, stop giving them so much credibility. If some nut on the street said half of what's come out of this election, they'd be locked up, not considered \"representative\" of anything. <br/><br/>Also stop presenting this unsightly mess as if it was some sort of Boomer idea. It wasn't, and isn't. \"Entitlement\" was fought for, like rights, meds prices and everything else, in the face of this grotesque tyranny of corruption and greed. What's happening is that those basic rights and entitlements are being stolen, every single day. If you want to be medieval serfs, wallowing in endless catastrophes, just keep ignoring the fact that this is happening now, not 50 years ago. <br/><br/>Keep blaming the past, and see what spectator criticism without action achieves.

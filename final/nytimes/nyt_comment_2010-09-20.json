During a recent private exchange, later very public, Mr. Kuban declined my acolades and again reminded this wide audience that PCT was your creation.  While Mr. Kuban and his readers often cite PCT in countless discussions, it nice to finally know the origin.<br />Does PCT have merit?  Hell Yes!  I suspect that OCT has for more relevance then you knew, when you first expressed it.  If you remember the encounter, apparently with Ed Livine, perhaps you can recall whether it was a seriously considered comment, or light humor.  Do you?  In the interveneing years, PCT has taken on some weight of its own and acquired considerable traction.  I for one believe that your theory both serious and of remarkable insight.  As I push 60, and with some 45+ years of serious eating experience in hand, including the odd pizza in 15+ countries and countless American 'joints,' as well as my own kitchen, hell yes!  I am still sort of trying to recreate something close to my first 'cognitive' pizza, from roughly 1964.  To date, I've come close, but no cigar.<br />To be sure, the world now includes much better (and much worse) pizza than I ate in '64.  I know know enough about making the stuff that the '64 pie is not really an ideal target, yet I would eat it again, in an instant!  In my never humble opinion, PCT is a very real thing.  WHile PCT may no longer produce the target, it is a perfectly leitmate point of reference and one that I will never lose.  I guess I am a middle-of the-road pizza guy:  I do not eat (and detenst) manufactured/frozen/mass-market pies just as much as I ignore the Neo-Neapolitain craze of burned crust, too much bread and whimpy tops, perhaps graced with two basil leaves, especially those in teh $18-$35 range.

I'm heartened that other readers don't bother with mise. They shouldn't--as you say, it's a restaurant technique, and I consider it one that's usually counterproductive in the home kitchen. I think it's a major shame that people learning to cook today are often taught unnecessary restaurant techniques--it makes cooking seem way too complex, rigid and messy (all those wee bowls!).<br /><br />In my cookbook, Forking Fantastic!, published last year, my coauthor and I took the no-mise approach that Sarah Moulton does. Our recipes list ingredients, untouched, then describe what to do with them in the instructions. It's not rocket science--it just describes the most practical way of using your time in the kitchen. And, if you read enough recipes like this, you'll be a better, more efficient home cook.<br /><br />Last year, I also did a podcast based on this no-mise idea. It's called Cooking in Real Time (<a href=\"http://www.cookinginrealtime.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.cookinginrealtime.com</a>), and each episode covers the preparation of a meal, showing how you can step back and forth between stove and cutting board. It helps to train your ears and nose to tell you what's going on when you're not at the stove.<br /><br />Good luck, new cooks!  Shake off the shackles of mise en place!", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

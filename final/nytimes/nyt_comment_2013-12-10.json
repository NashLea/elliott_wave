Four assembly plants were closed, costing thousands of jobs (although one has been partially reopened). Loss of efficiency? Again, oh please! I suppose that you've never been inside an automotive assembly plant, so I'll instruct you that the lines run at a rate of 50-70 cars per hour, and each worker has a variety of tasks to perform. Every company has invested heavily in robotics and other means of automation. Even before the bankruptcy, machinery was being installed that operated more efficiently; jobs that once required 4 workers were suddenly being done with one or two workers. That trend continues today.<br/><br/>One more thing that continues to puzzle me... just how much did the $10.5 billion cost each individual taxpayer? I've been told there are about 190 million taxpayers (???) in the U.S. Again, I was told that figuring on that basis, the GM bailout ended up with an average cost of under $70 per taxpayer ($1.30 approximately per week.)  While I have no figures available to me to back that up, I do have a feeling that the $10.5 billion, while seemingly a large number, did not cost each and every taxpayer all that much.

Quite obviously if women have not been able to demonstrate their ability we cannot have any basis for saying women are equal in ability to men--we cannot know that fact. We have to FIRST give women a chance to determine if they are equal in every way. That is just common sense.<br/><br/>But you Paul, and apparently the 10 people who agreed with you say automatically without any clear evidential basis that women are not only equal in ability to men they would have contributed as equally as men over the centuries if not for men.   <br/><br/>Paul, just because I have no overpowering reason for supposing women would not have had equal contributions to men if they had had a chance over the centuries does not at all mean they are equal in ability. You, Paul, have no overpowering reason for supposing they would have been equal in contribution. We quite simply have no historical record for demonstrating either way. Basic logic. The fact is we are finding out more and more every day abilities of men and women.

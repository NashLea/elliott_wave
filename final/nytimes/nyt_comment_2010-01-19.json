It might look like it from his technique, but he is definitely hitting the ball with little lift on the instep of his foot. We have a hard time translating it, but it's his tremendous strength, and short, explosive swing when he reaches the ball that puts that action on it. Lots of time on the training ground! That video is from a few years ago when he could almost be counted on for a double a game and every free kick within 35 yards was a surefire chance.<br /><br />And one more is Ronaldo's signature \"chop\", normally done on the byline.

I used to do all of this virtually on my own, but this year I find myself exhausted from two days of preparations and feasting.  I made a bid to serve green salad instead of green beans, and was roundly reproached for messing with family tradition.  (I was also told I did not make enough gravy to last through all the left-overs!)  And then, after 40+ years of baking, I left the yeast out of the yeast biscuits!  Word to the wise:  it doesn't work that well to try and incorporate it later!  On the other hand, the fruitcake got raves, and everyone ate so much that no one wanted supper.   We followed our tradition of talking about what each of us is most grateful for this year.....Counting our blessings!  <br/><br/>And I am thankful for WordPlay and our intrepid puzzle-makers.

Those examples were blood-curdling. I guess the more subtle argument is whether the rise of organized sports is just a symptom of the trend toward greater civility or whether it played a bigger role, as a substitute for conflict that helped make change. Lacrosse among American Indians is an interesting example. It was sometimes used to settle disputes and prevent warring among the Iroquois nations. During the World Cup, I think most people would be too busy watching soccer to fight. The more sports, the merrier, it seems.

Between Senator Franken being seated late in the session and Senator Kennedy's death, the window was quite narrow. There were two Senators in the Democratic caucus who made it publicly quite clear they would not support even a public option, let alone anything approaching single payer.<br/><br/>Do the math -- at the time, it took 60 Senators and 218 House Members to pass a law. Those numbers did not exist for single payer in 2010. Or within my lifetime. (I was born during the Kennedy administration.)<br/><br/>The House, with only Democratic votes, barely passed the ACA, and only after rolling back a few things.<br/><br/>The ACA is flawed, but was politically achievable. It accomplished something Presidents had been trying to do for 97 years.  <br/><br/>It was forward movement -- progress. Letting the good, or even the better, be the enemy of the perceived perfect is bad governance.

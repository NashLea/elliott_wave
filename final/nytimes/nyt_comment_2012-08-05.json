I have been away for a few days.<br/><br/>To specifically adddress your inquiries, I did know of Ye Shiwen's accomplishments, and although I have covered eight Olympics and wrote almost exclusively about Olympics sports (including swimming) for more than a decade, I have not been around her personally, either in an interview setting or on the pool deck. She is clearly a remarkable young athlete. And only 16.<br/><br/>I have read and watched interviews with both her Australian coaches --- these came *after* the discussion began to mushroom online --- and the coaches are passionate in their defense of Ms. Ye and her Chinese teammates. Ken Wood, for example, said drug testers were \"all over\" the Chinese athletes when they were training with him near Brsibane, and the tests were never announced or predictable. (Typically, he said, the Chinese swimmers came into Australia as a group, trained for about 12 weeks and then returned home.)<br/><br/>What I think is sometimes being misconstrued in this fascinating online discussion is that John Leonard, the veteran swim coach who first ignited the issue, suggested that Ms. Ye's sudden spike in performance in the 400IM is what deserves scrutiny because she had swum part of her race as fast as the elite men have ever gone.  (That said, I do not pretend  to speak for Mr. Leonard, of course, nor do I endorse his views.)<br/><br/>Again, it's not that Ms. Ye won the gold medal, or swam fast, or even set a record. It was the *spike* that caught Mr. Leonard's attention. And let's be frank: Almost any time a feamle athlete performs athletically as well as an *elite* male athlete, well, that is going to spark a discussion. It's notable, it's extraordinary, and it's news. <br/><br/>Now, drugs is just *one* possible explanation for any majestic performance, and perhaps it's the quick, easy, lazy explanation here. It's certainly a rush to judgment.  <br/><br/>Alas, all the previous drug cheats --- whether they were Chinese swimmers, Canadian sprinters, American cyclists or Turkish weightlifters ---- have made it that much harder on successive generations of athletes. The damage done to the Tour de France brand, for just one example, is incalcuable, and the taint of drugs now hangs on so many astonishing feats. It just does. I agree that it's not pleasant or fair. But it's real. (It's especially discouraging when young athletes are tarred with that brush.) Even Ms. Ye's own father said after her 400IM that it was \"natural to be suspicious\" of her astounding feat. <br/><br/>Previous breakout performances --- Michelle Smith, Marion Jones, Ben Johnson, East German swimmers, pro cyclists and athletes in many sports --- have sometimes come through drugs. Some athletes cheat, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, discipline or gender. If they didn't cheat, if they all lived up to the Olympic ideal, there would be no need for drug testing.<br/><br/>Hard training, new techniques, genetic gifts, special psychological preparation --- so many things could have combined to contribute to Ms. Ye's burst. We don't know. The best available laboratory evidence clearly shows that she did not cheat. Her drug tests are clean, as they have been in training and as they were after her London races. For most people, including for many in swimming, that's enough evidence. Some others feel, however, and perhaps Mr. Leonard is among them, that a phenomenal performance spike could perhaps be considered as *anecdotal* evidence. Again, I am not making this argument, and I do not presume to know Mr. Leonard's mind.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your comments, Mike, and I appreciate the many reasonable and thoughtful comments offered in this thread. I hope it continues. I look forward to further exchanges.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>\nMark McDonald", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3333025, "replies": [], "lft": 54, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/opinion/sunday/douthat-mr-negative-vs-mr-complacent.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 6789769, "rgt": 55, "userDisplayName": "Stu Freeman", "createDate": "1344143918", "userID": 35591703, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1344143954", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Brooklyn, N.Y.", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1344140354", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "Mr. Douthat is either hearing-impaired or prone to ignoring any factual details that intrude upon his own right-wing fantasies.

The GOP pretends that the deficit can be brought under control and jobs made available to all and sundry without any new revenues whatsoever.

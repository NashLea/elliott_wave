Obama promised less war, but extended the occupation of Iraq, and added to that Afghanistan, Libya, and, now quite possibly Iran. Obama railed against Bush's State Secrets doctrine, only to invoke that very doctrine in federal court weeks after his inauguration. Obama signed an executive order claiming the right to keep people locked up for life AFTER acquittal.  And soon, Obama will sign in to law renewal of the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes the military to arrest American citizens on American soil without charges and to hold them indefinitely with no opportunity to challenge the arrest or detention before a judge.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ron Paul has an unassailable 30 record of unwavering opposition to unconstitutional militarism and defense of civil liberty.

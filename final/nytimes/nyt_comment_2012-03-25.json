So no - it's not \"obvious.\"<br/><br/>(b) Your 7% to 15% return is about right - though, for most students, the return is above 7%, and the dataset used included all university graduates who had terminal bachelors (including those who took more than four years), and significantly did *not* include those who went on to gain graduate degrees (who would boost the earnings considerably). The results come from AEI, not from the \"college professors\" you disparage: <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/article/education/higher-education/is-college-worth-the-investment/\" title=\"http://www.aei.org/article/education/higher-education/is-college-worth-the-investment/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.aei.org/article/education/higher-education/is-college-worth-t...</a> <br/><br/>And, as NA Expat mentions, a greater-than-7% yearly return on *any* investment is pretty darn good. Name another one that has such strong evidence of value - housing? Good luck with that. Stocks? Neither the S&amp;P 500 or the DJIA are back at their 5-year highs - and they hit those highs, well, about 5 years ago. ROI for them: about 0%.<br/><br/>The important point is, as the author says, that we have to prepare students for it, and the students then have to work for it.

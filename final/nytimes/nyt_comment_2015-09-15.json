And the power struggle between the US and Russia over that influence, in particular with Russia using Syria as its ally in the region, has been going on for decades. It was Russia using and providing military assistance to Syria, and the US to Israel.<br/>In the 1981 Israeli war in Lebenon the air wars were not so much as between Israeli and Syrian pilots, as they were between the American F16 and the Russian MIG fighter planes. But it goes even farther back to the Russians supporting all of the Arab armies and the US supporting Israel.<br/>So talk of \"adding to the chaos in Syria\" is plain nonsesne, as was getting Bulgria to block Russian planes from its airspace. From looking at a map its plain that Bulgaria is nowhere near the flight path between Russia and Syria, and was nothing more than the US trying to stick it to Russia showing which countries they have more influence with, and not being able to get Iraq to side with the US can be seen as a serious defeat.<br/>That this is all about power and influence is obvious to anyone familiar with the history of the two countries in the region. And those politicians talking as if they are being sincere when expressing their \"concerns\" to the Russians are acting like babies, and are idiots for thinking they are being taken seriously.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 3437771, "replies": [], "lft": 1433, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/world/middleeast/russian-moves-in-syria-widen-role-in-mideast.html", "parentID": 16088836, "commentID": 16089583, "rgt": 1434, "userDisplayName": "JoeSixPack", "createDate": "1442290063", "userID": 47358698, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1442290479", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NorthEast USA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1442286879", "commentSequence": 16089583, "commentBody": "Who should be in charge in the Middle East?

This  is because of the rigors required by living a pious life.  Anyone that can accomplish that must be a good and decent person.  Well, that's the tradition.<br/><br/>This is nothing but political pandering.  It is an attempt to wrap oneself in the cloak of religion to appear righteous, just and trustworthy.  Even when politicians are caught red handed in some kind of fraud or crime, the first the they always say is, \"I'll pray on it\" like they will receive divine instructions.  <br/><br/>This is not a Christian nation.  The founding fathers were deists.  They believed that God created the universe, but after creation, it was hands off.  The universe runs on its own.  No divine intervention.<br/><br/>America is born of secular, enlightenment philosophy based in reason.  Many of the phrases commonly used circa 1800 that invoked religion, were just that, common phrases.  They didn't carry the same meaning that modern religious types assign to them. <br/><br/>Conservatives that use religion to justify ignorant policy are just  using ignorance to justify more ignorance.  It sound really good.  Opposing them with reason and science puts the opposer in the position of appearing non-pious, or untrustworthy.  Religion is like the poison pill of politics.  Accept it and promote its false claims to appear trustworthy, or reject it, embrace reason, and appear untrustworthy.

American troops have died in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan without any clear idea of why they were there or why they were asked to go in harms way. Certainly, the world must face ISIS and branches with a new kind of thinking-both politically and militarily. If ever there was a time for \"new think\" military leaders to emerge in US it is now.

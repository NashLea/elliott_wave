It may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family and/or social nudism.<br /><br />Society in general has decided public nudism can be very confronting, inappropriate, and even regarded as obscene by some. Although nudism is often practiced in a person's home or garden, either alone or with members of the family public and in restricted venues public nudity is a behaviour which society in general have deemed should be restricted and subject to judicial penalty.<br /><br />In my opinion the burka is much more of an obscenity than nudity. For where nudism seeks to expand the societal bounds and diminish prejudice the burka politically advocates a denigrating, subservient role in society for women.<br /><br />The burka reinforces the notion women are not only to blame for men\u2019s behaviour towards them in regards sexual assaults but also women\u2019s aspirations should be necessarily be different and subservient to a man\u2019s definition of what a woman\u2019s life should be.<br /><br />The public wearing of the burka is a categorical political act which seeks to advance the notion of the acceptance of the subservience and restriction of women\u2019s opportunities in life relative to men which is absolutely obscene and must therefore be subject to judicial penalty.<br /><br />mmm I wonder what the rights and moral dignity are for the 12year old girl recently claiming she was raped by an 80 year old man in Saudi Arabia who paid her father a substantial dowry? \"...far more rights and moral dignity than other could ever imagine to possess and practice\" - I do not think the reality matches the text.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1164366, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/dirty-person/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1569552, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "afay", "createDate": "1266214455", "userID": 57607671, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266215624", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Atlanta", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266215624", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "I enjoyed my fastest time ever on this puzzle (though I'm not telling what that time is, because it's embarrassingly slow), and I credit that to the smoothness of this puzzle.

Benson (#222) and others that apparently refuse to accept reality with respect to temperature changes since 1850.<br /><br />Phil Jones, from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (UK), had a central role in supplying the HadCRU temperature data and was involved in the \u2018Climategate\u2019 regarding the leaked e-mails. Recently he answered some questions from a BBC journalist. Two important answers are given below. It is obvious that he admits that during the period from 1910-1940 and also earlier (1860-1880) global temperature was increasing at a speed similar to the 1975-1998 period. Furthermore, he admits that there was no global warming from 1995 to the present.<br /><br />The BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin put questions to Professor Jones, including several gathered from climate sceptics. The questions were put to Professor Jones with the co-operation of UEA's press office.<br /><br />A - Do you agree that according to the global temperature record used by the IPCC, the rates of global warming from 1860-1880, 1910-1940 and 1975-1998 were identical?<br /><br />[\u2026]<br />So, in answer to the question, the warming rates for all 4 periods are similar and not statistically significantly different from each other.<br />Here are the trends and significances for each period:<br />Period\tLength\tTrend (Degrees C per decade)\tSignificance<br />1860-1880\t21\t      0.163\t                                        Yes<br />1910-1940\t31\t      0.15\t                                        Yes<br />1975-1998\t24\t      0.166                    \t                Yes<br />1975-2009\t35\t      0.161\t                                        Yes<br /><br />B - Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically-significant global warming<br />Yes, but only just. I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009. This trend (0.12C per decade) is positive, but not significant at the 95% significance level. The positive trend is quite close to the significance level. Achieving statistical significance in scientific terms is much more likely for longer periods, and much less likely for shorter periods.

[In case you don\u2019t already know, Phil Jones is the climate scientist at the center of the Climategate e-mails, and whose compilation of historic global temperature data from the late 1800s to the present is a key element of the IPCC\u2019s reports.]  These Q-and-As, as readers of the two earlier posts recognize, reveal (a) the lack of empirical support for claims that recent warming is exceptional and (b) the flawed logic behind assertions that \u201cMost of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.\u201d<br /><br />Specifically, the Q-and-As confirm what many skeptics have long suspected:<br /><br />    * Neither the rate nor magnitude of recent warming is exceptional.<br />    * There was no significant warming from 1998-2009. According to the IPCC we should have seen a global temperature increase of at least 0.2\u00b0C per decade.<br />    * The IPCC models may have overestimated the climate sensitivity for greenhouse gases, underestimated natural variability, or both.<br />    * This also suggests that there is a systematic upward bias in the impacts estimates based on these models just from this factor alone.<br />    * The logic behind attribution of current warming to well-mixed man-made greenhouse gases is faulty.<br />    * The science is not settled, however unsettling that might be.<br />    * There is a tendency in the IPCC reports to leave out inconvenient findings, especially in the part(s) most likely to be read by policy makers.<br /><br />This is from Phil Jones himself ...<br /><br />Where will you base your thought police, as they may need to spring into action the next time Jones speaks.<br /><br />Best Wishes ", "recommendationCount": 11}, {"assetID": 1157248, "replies": [], "lft": 250, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/a-historian-looks-back-at-the-climate-fight/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1568978, "rgt": 251, "userDisplayName": "Mark A.

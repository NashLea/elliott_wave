Accusing the Democrats of being too liberal, or progressive if you will, doesn't ring true; the great age of Democratic liberalism was the 1930's through 1960's, when their accomplishments were stuff that we can only dream about today. In that era (which was certainly not trouble-free), labor unions were the chief supporters of Democratic liberalism, but today's relegation of what's left of the unions to the sidelines has left the Democrats dependent to a much larger extent on Big Money. So if anything, Democrats have been forced further to the right.<br/><br/>In that earlier era, mainstream Republicans like Eisenhower were about as liberal as today's Democrats, but today's Republicans seem to yearn to return to the \"Gilded Age\" of the late 19th Century, when J.P. Morgan and the rest of the Four Hundred ran the country, people (including children) worked 14-hour days, living conditions for many were squalid, and disease was rampant.<br/><br/>So yes, our democracy is in trouble, but that's the way Republicans seem to want it.

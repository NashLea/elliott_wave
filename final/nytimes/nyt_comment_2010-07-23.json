Their narrative is that Republicans want America to be SAFE and that we were safe under Bush.  Bing--there went 9/11, when Bush was not really President, because he was \"tending to business\" in Texas.  And Cheney, the master manipulator, started playing the fear card--so little respect did he have for the American people's intelligence and ability to think about the truth of what he spoke.  Turns out he guessed right!  And our country became a \"You are with us, or you are against us\" crazy place.  Cheney laughed all the way to the bank with his Halliburton/KBR stock options SAFELY tucked away.  Nobody talked about how he and his cohorts were getting richer off the Iraq War--that would have been considered treasonous.  And the MSM press followed along like the little lemmings they are.  Now they are doing it by NOT talking about how the Republicans are reinventing reality, and are the party of the rich and corporate--period.<br /><br />As for Mitch McConnell, when he steps up to the mic, he digs himself and his entire party of careless sociopaths in a little deeper.

(And for the record, Congress hasn\u2019t always been held in such low esteem, so it\u2019s not just perpetual anti-government feeling on the part of Americans\u2014in the 50s and 60s well over half of Americans said they felt government was looking out for their best interests.  The process by which we\u2019ve moved from where we were then politically and economically to where we are now is described excellently in a book called Supercapitalism, by Robert Reich--he talks about how the balance of power between capitalism and democracy has shifted in favor of the former, and how this has been good for people\u2019s consumer and investor sides, but bad for our citizen side\u2014a really good analysis if you\u2019re interested).   But as for what to practically do about the situation as it currently stands, it certainly seems like no leadership is forthcoming from our elected \u201cleaders\u201d on this, so there would need to be a lot of prodding by we the people\u2014not terribly likely that we\u2019d have a big enough groundswell without their being more public discussion of the situation by politicians and the media, but 80% negatives for Congress is a high enough number for maybe something to happen.  A more frequent discussion here (maybe even by some columnists?), and some calls to our congresspeople would be a start\u2026", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 1678603, "replies": [], "lft": 56, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/us/politics/23self.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2294697, "rgt": 57, "userDisplayName": "blacklight", "createDate": "1279854463", "userID": 40176848, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1279858465", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1279854865", "commentSequence": 33, "commentBody": "Linda McMahon has a jobs plan \"backed with exprience\"?

I had a very long exchange on this point in the latest Unforced Variations open thread on <a href=\"http://RealClimate.org\" target=\"_blank\">RealClimate.org</a> .  Hansen isn't completely off the mark, because the almost undbounded ability of clouds to increase climate sensitivity makes it hard to rule out a \"Venus Syndrome\" runaway for earth from first principels. But it is such an extremely unlikely scenario that I think it is a mistake to give this too much emphasis; it definitely isn't a \"dead certainty\" as a result of burning all the coal.<br /><br />So, what do we have -- the Earth is very unliely to turn into Venus, lose its oceans, and sterilize away all life.  But, unless we are very lucky with climate sensitivity (or with coal running out before most people think) it's not at all implausible that you could wipe out most agriculture in the Tropics, and make half the planet uninhabitable for mammals outdoors.

The most thorough comment is that of boallab who wrote;<br /><br />lderry (Comment#69340)<br />February 12th, 2011 at 8:53 pm<br />Another aspect of the peer review process that has received a lot of attention on the blogosphere is the claim that Steig wrote an 88 page review of an 8 page paper. This claim was made by Id and Watts in separate blog postings.<br /><br />Lets check this person's facts that Jeff Id claimed the Dr. Steig wrote an 88 page review by going to Jeff Id's post and looking:<br /><a href=\"http://noconsensus.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/doing-it-ourselves/\" target=\"_blank\">http://noconsensus.wordpress.com...</a><br /><br />Some of you remember that we intended to submit the analysis of the Steig Antarctic reconstruction for publication.  That was quite some time ago . . . and then you heard nothing.  We did, indeed, submit a paper to Journal of Climate in February.  The review process unfortunately took longer than expected, primarily due to one reviewer in particular.  The total number of pages dedicated by just that reviewer alone and our subsequent responses \u2013 was 88 single-spaced pages, or more than 10 times the length of the paper.  Another contributor to the length of time from submission to acceptance was a hardware upgrade to the AMS servers that went horribly wrong, heaping a load of extra work on the Journal of Climate editorial staff.<br /><br />Hmm nope Jeff Id didn't claim that Dr. Steig wrote an 88 page review.<br /><br />You see commentators of the paper made the mistake of attribution of all 88 pages to the Review itself something that the authors particularly Ryan O  attempted to correct in the comments section on the Doing it Ourselves post:<br />Ryan O said<br /><br />December 1, 2010 at 11:45 pm<br />I think I know who the reviewer was, and I honestly don\u2019t think that Mann had a majority of the involvement. Perhaps as an advisor, or perhaps adding some supplementary comments . . . but I do not believe he was the primary author of the review.<br /><br />Oh, and the 88 pages included our responses, too.   Our responses were actually longer than the reviews, because the issues being discussed required a good deal of background information, lest they degenerate into a he-said-she-said orgy of arm-waving.   Needless to say, though, nearly 40 pages of review was a bit daunting!<br /><br />Now lets see if Mr. Watts made the claim of Dr. Steig writing an 88 page review by pulling up his post on the subject (which was nothing but a crosspost of the one from the air vent with an intro):<br /><a href=\"http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/12/01/skeptic-paper-accepted-on-antarctica-rebuts-steig-et-al/\" target=\"_blank\">http://wattsupwiththat.com...</a><br /><br />In a blow to the Real Climate \u201chockey team\u201d one team member\u2019s paper, Steig et al Nature, Jan 22, 2009 (seen at left) has been shown lacking. Once appropriate statistical procedures were applied, the real data spoke clearly, and it was done in a peer reviewed paper by skeptics. Jeff Condon of the Air Vent writes via email that he and co-authors, Ryan O\u2019Donnell, Nicholas Lewis, and Steve McIntyre have succeeded in getting a paper accepted into the prestigious Journal of Climate and asked me to re-post the notice here.<br /><br />The review process was difficult, with one reviewer getting difficult on submitted comments [and subsequent rebuttal comments from authors ] that became longer than the submitted paper, 88 pages, 10 times the length of the paper they submitted! I commend them for their patience in wading through such formidable bloviation. Anyone want to bet that reviewer was a \u201cteam\u201d member?<br /><br />As WUWT covered in the past, these authors have demonstrated clearly that the warming is mostly in the Antarctic Peninsula. Steig et al\u2019s Mannian PCA math methods had smeared that warming over most of the entire continent, creating a false impression.<br /><br />WUWT visitors may want to read this primer which explains how this happens. But most importantly, have a look at the side by side comparison maps below. Congratulations to Jeff, Ryan, Nick, and Steve! \u2013 Anthony<br /><br />You see when Anthony first posted it he made the same mistake other commentators did, but he saw Ryan O's post that I copied on the Air Vent and corrected it the same day which can be seen here from a copy of a comment about that from WUWT:<br />Rational Debate says:<br />December 1, 2010 at 8:45 pm<br />Many kudo\u2019s to all involved!<br /><br />Anthony, summat trivial here, but what appears to be an inconsistency. In your write up it sounds as if the \u2018sticky\u2019 peer reviewer submitted 88 pages, where in the author comments following the abstract (did I miss where it said who actually wrote that bit?), it looks as if there were 88 pages total including both the peer reviewer comments AND the author replies\u2026.<br /><br />Question for all\u2026 anyone know why that larger cooling area might be occurring?

Sen. Dick Durbin explained it back in April 2009 when he tried unsuccessfully, at the height of the financial crisis, to get mild bankruptcy reform through the Senate: \"And the banks -- hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created -- are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place.\"<br /><br />It is hardly surprising that the Congress is underfunding the S.E.C. -- they don't want the S.E.C. catching any big-time crooks. Those crooks are Congress's bread and butter.<br /><br />But the Congress needn\u2019t have worried. Just as in the days when \"No One Would Listen\" to Harry Markopolos, the S.E.C. is still pretty much sitting on its hands. Every once in a while, they nab some small-time (by Wall Street standards) crook in a $2,000 suit, but they keep their hands off the big boys. After all, the S.E.C. \u2013 in fact, ALL the so-called \"regulatory agencies\" \u2013 are beholden to the crooks, too. Most of the high-ranking regulators come from Wall Street, and after they do their \"public service\" stint, they'll be right back on the Street, raking in the big bucks.  Just yesterday, Eric Dash of the Times reported that \"Joseph Jiampietro, one of the government's top deal makers during the financial crisis, has joined Goldman Sachs as a senior investment banker covering the financial services industry....\" Dash describes Jiampietro as the FDIC's \"main liason to hedge funds and broader Wall Street community,\" and he adds, \"Mr. Jiampietro is the latest in a parade of top federal official to leave Washington for Wall Street.\" Prior to \"his stint in Washington,\" Jiampietro was an investment banker. Do you really think Mr. Jiampietro's \"stint in Washington\" had anything to do with public service?<br /><br />The chair of the S.E.C. \u2013 Mary Schapiro \u2013 has a long history as a regulator, beginning way back in the days when Ronald Reagan appointed her to sit on the S.E.C. You might think that would make her a tough cookie. Not really. Like the rest of her regulator colleagues, she's in it for the dough. Back in 2008, her last year as head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's (ha ha ha) self-policing arm, Schapiro hauled in compensation of $3.3 million. According to Wikipedia, \"on departure from FINRA, she received additional lump sum retirement benefit payments that brought her total package in 2008 to $8,985,334 (about the same as Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein made in that year.\"<br /><br />You might suppose that kind of payout would alarm the Senate, which had to \u201cadvise &amp; consent\u201d to Schapiro's appointment to head the S.E.C. After all, the Senate regularly puts on hold for months or even years confirmation votes for minor appointments. But, no, in the wake of her big payoff and again during the height of the financial crisis, the Senate cleared Schapiro with a voice vote. The Senate in its wisdom Dr. Schapiro would follow that part of the Hippocratic Oath that reads \"first, do not harm.\" Just think of the great job Schapiro will get with all those marketable \"on-the-job\" training she's acquired at the S.E.C.<br /><br />Which, to follow Frank's structure, brings us back to Bernie Madoff. It is hardly surprising that Irving Picard is the prime mover in connecting the dots between Madoff and his enablers at JPMorgan Chase. Despite Mr. Markopolos' many pleas to the S.E.C. and the extensive documentation he sent them, it wasn't the S.E.C. that brought down Madoff. It was Madoff's own sons who told the F.B.I. that their father was running a Ponzi scheme. Where was the S.E.C.? They had previously \"investigated\" Bernie Madoff. They didn't find a thing. They wouldn\u2019t, would they?<br /><br />The Constant Weader at <a href=\"http://www.RealityChex.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RealityChex.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 1119}, {"assetID": 2406652, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/opinion/13rich.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3378803, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Larry Eisenberg", "createDate": "1297562145", "userID": 56166904, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1297577254", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1297577254", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "B.

With good reason, of course: we have shown a rare genius for betraying our own best interests with our wars, our support of dictators, our repeated failures to sensibly regulate, our handouts to those who require no help, and our disregard for any citizen too poor (or otherwise disinclined) to contribute to a political campaign.<br />", "recommendationCount": 299}, {"assetID": 2406652, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/opinion/13rich.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3378845, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "Winning Progressive", "createDate": "1297564185", "userID": 61073654, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1297577254", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago, IL", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1297577254", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "Dimon is upset that people keep saying \"bankers, bankers, bankers\"????? What we should all be saying is \"banksters, banksters, banksters\" as the financial industry leading up to the economic collapse of 2008 was little more than organized crime.<br /><br />Given how the banksters caused a nearly complete economic and financial meltdown, it is truly amazing how much power they still have in our political system.  While the financial reform legislation enacted by President Obama and the Democrats in Congress in 2010 was an important step toward reining in the financial industry, the fact that that legislation was all we could get shows that the banksters and their lobbyists have not been sidelined in our political system the way they should.  Instead, they were able to stop more aggressive legislation and ensure a Republican takeover of Congress, which will further undermine the ability of our government to effectively oversee the financial industry.<br /><br />What this entire situation does show, however, is how critical it is for progressives to get involved in taking back our democracy. On election day, our votes count can outweigh the banksters' money, but only if we get organized.

Mark-to-market accounting is a legal form of accounting for a venture involved in buying and selling securities in accordance with U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 475.Under mark-to-market accounting, an asset's entire present and future discounted streams of net cash flows are considered a credit on the balance sheet. This accounting method was one of the many things that contributed to the Enron scandal.<br /><br />Many people attribute the Enron scandal entirely to cooking the books or accounting fraud. In fact, marking to the market or \"marking to the myth\", as Buffett so aptly christened it, also plays an important role in the Enron story. Mark-to-market accounting is not illegal, but it can be dangerous. (To gain an understanding of this particular weapon, put aside a few hours to watch \"The Smartest Guys In The Room\", a movie about the Enron scandal.)<br /><br />Buffett suggests that many types of derivatives can generate reported earnings that are frequently outrageously overstated. This occurs because their future values are based on estimates; this is problematic because it is human nature to be optimistic about future events. In addition, error may also lie in the fact that someone's compensation might be based on those rosy projections, which brings issues of motives and greed into play.<br />", "recommendationCount": 199}, {"assetID": 2406652, "replies": [], "lft": 38, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/opinion/13rich.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3378920, "rgt": 39, "userDisplayName": "RS", "createDate": "1297566174", "userID": 46923717, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1297577254", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1297577254", "commentSequence": 13, "commentBody": "You make all good points about the financial industry but not about the SEC.

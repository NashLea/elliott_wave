As I listen to him these days, I cannot help but wonder whether anything at all raises his ire.  His communication ability has degraded to the point that it is infuriating to those of us who are outraged at the nihilist, ignorant Tea Party thugs, and the inability of the paralyzed Republicans to control their spawn. We don't need Obama's dreary and measured recitations of the complexities of things - we need a bare knuckle brawler like LBJ to ram things through Congress, at which he was spectacularly good.  He should call the Republicans out - not endlessly try to placate them, which will never happen.  I fear that we will all be sold down the river if this tide doesn't turn.

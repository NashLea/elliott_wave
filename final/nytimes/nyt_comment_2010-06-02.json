However, going in to college I (and I'm sure she) had to sign documents that told me what I was going to owe coming out.  Knowing I was going to have a comparably reasonable $45,000 in debt made me sign up for an economics class and buy a personal finance book, and quite honestly has been a soul wrenching lesson over the years since I graduated, as I watch my more privileged friends take jobs in writing, art, theater, and music, and ask their parents to pay the rent.  I work in wealth management now primarily because I want to be able to understand this stuff better and teach it to others, but I suffer over what I've been told was the 'low price of my soul.'<br /><br />How about making some more reasonable points, such as the fact that Citi and others charge double digit interest for loans that the state has basically made un-extinguishable (returns are supposed to be lower on lower risk securities)?  How about colleges are buying fancy new buildings and renovating their dorms and gyms to keep up with each other in a race to tempt the 'rich kids,' while hiking up costs for all of their students?  In preparing financial plans, my company models the future expense of college at 2% more than inflation (this is the only expense modeled that way) as a result.  How about athletic scholarships that come with 'food allowances' that allow many athletes to subsidize their (free) education with unlimited meals while their peers live on macaroni and cheese at the end of the semester?  How about there being no required practical link between a 'liberal arts education' and a monthly rent check, not even in the way of subtle advice or professional life skills?  How about choosing to do what is necessary instead of what you love as a career?  How about middle class kids being unable (or unwilling) to continue on to graduate school because they don't like the idea of adding another $100,000 (plus lost wages) to what that they already owe, and therefore killing the chance of a higher salary in the future.  Or even worse, these kids could realize that they must go to graduate school because their undergrad education doesn't qualify them to operate a cash register.<br /><br />The author said \"perhaps the bank worried that once it approved one loan, cutting her off would have led her to drop out or transfer and have trouble paying back the loan.\"<br />How about perhaps she was old enough to go to war, smoke cigarettes, and probably spend plenty of that $100,000 on food, drinks, and fun in lower Manhattan with her classmates, not to mention legally sign that she knew what she was doing?  Doctors can only tell you not to eat fatty foods - it's not their fault if you have a heart attack!<br /><br />Also, please don't include a picture of Cortney looking forlorn in front of Citi with her shiny bike.  I ride 40+ miles a week and had to choose to get a rusty secondhand bike from the 1980s because I'm paying my loans.

It is the same short sightedness adopted by individuals who got into mortgages they could not afford. These situations are not the fault of the lenders. Yes, very bad lending practices were followed, but it is always the responsibility of the borrower to ensure that the loan fits in with their current and future financial goals. Investments are the same. When an investor takes a risk and it comes out bad, unless the person was scammed, it is generally accepted that the investor assumed the risk on his own and lost. The same should be said for borrowing. The borrowers gamble on the chance that their adjustable rate mortgages would not sky rocket. The students gamble on the chance that a college degree will ensure sufficient income to pay the loan. In all cases, if the borrower/investor takes a litle time to consider past experiences (both their own and others) and present financial state as well as map out their financial future, even in very simple layman terms, he/she can avoid these financial pitfalls.

I also read about the plan that Obama just passed which will drop off some of your student loans if you work in public service and that if you are over I think 50k or 70k in student loans you only have to pay for 30 years and that's it regardless if you have not paid off the entire loan.  None of these things did I know when I was in school....not one loan counselor informed me of the options available to me.  Also if I could do it again I probably would have went to a state school and spent 50k less money and still received a decent education....but as they say you live and you learn....sometimes life experience is a better teacher than any school!", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1502923, "replies": [], "lft": 300, "assetURL": "http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/teaching-wealthy-children-the-value-of-work/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2067640, "rgt": 301, "userDisplayName": "Susan", "createDate": "1275451017", "userID": 35983344, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1275451710", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Mpls, MN", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1275448110", "commentSequence": 144, "commentBody": "When our daughter was young, we felt it was important to teach her how to do 3 things:  To earn money, to save money, and to spend money wisely.

Plentiful long term living wage jobs for tthe MAJORITY of americans to attain the \"dream\" is no longer the norm and you all should have a clue as to why by now.  Raising the retirement age is not only ridiculous but will only exacerbate the already dreadful unemployment problem for millions of younger workers desperately seeking meaningful work.  May I propose a few humble solutions:<br />1. Lower the full retirement age to at least 60.  This will open up a multitude of jobs to so many unemployed who WANT to work.<br />2. Scrap the Cap on the limit of earnings one makes to cease making contributions into the Social Security(Medicare) system.<br />3.  The U.S. government must make a concerted effort to bring back good paying manufacturing jobs and make it economically prohibitive for greed driven corporations to relocate to foreign countries with no thought or responsibility to the future of this country, its people, or the rest of the world.<br />4. A gradual and deliberate conversion of a war based economy and a planetary degradation system to one that works in conjunction with the environment and the well being of all life on this fragile planet by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and leading the way in pioneering clean and sustainable energy alternatives for openers.<br />5. Bring back the estate and capital gains taxes that only benefit the few and not the many, to where they should be, for starters.  Eliminate all the tax loop holes that allow the rich to keep getting richer and have every american pay his or her fair share most likely through a flat-tax on ALL income including exec's \"deferred compensation packages.\"<br />5. Resurrect the \"Good Neighbor\" policy proposed by FDR and help raise the living standards of the millions of impoverished people living south of our border and elsewhere around the globe without the current criminal practices of inhuman exploitation that is the S.O.P. of many a U.S. and European corporation.<br />These are just a few suggestions for some long term solutions for the serious problems of our own making. Sooner or later the people will have to act for the survival of this planet and themselves.

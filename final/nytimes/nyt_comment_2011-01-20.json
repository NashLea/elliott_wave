Timely payments from your customers is the key ingredient for success. With that in mind, late customer payments is a \"luxury\" you simply can't afford.<br /><br />The key is to forge a client relationship that is based on mutual respect. In a polite and respectful manner you have to make it clear to your customers that your business operates on the pay to play philosophy. Reassure your clients that although you understand the difficulties they may be facing, thirty days means thirty days. And remember -- always get a signature. Always keep a paper trail.<br /><br />Begin by putting in place a firm company-wide policy on collecting receivables. Print that policy on your invoices and statements - you can even incorporate a system of late charges to encourage timely payments. Your customers will appreciate your direct and honest manner.<br /><br />It's also important to let your clients know that as much as you cherish their relationship and their trust in your products or services -- rules are rules. Invoices are due when they're due and even you aren't above the rules.<br /><br />Polite but firm reinforcement is your key.<br /><br />Best of luck,<br /><br />Max Kleynburd, NYC Accountant<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.MKadvisors.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.MKadvisors.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.NYQuickbooks.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.NYQuickbooks.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/NYCaccountant\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.twitter.com/NYCaccountant</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2297078, "replies": [], "lft": 110, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/how-efficient-is-private-charity/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3257808, "rgt": 111, "userDisplayName": "Debbie R.", "createDate": "1295476338", "userID": 46923481, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295499875", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Brookline,MA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295499875", "commentSequence": 50, "commentBody": "Mr. Franke,<br /><br />You wrote disparagingly of the \"income transfer programs\" and asserted that not only have they failed to cure poverty, but they have made the problem worse.  So I don't think it is beyond the scope of this discussion to determine exactly which programs you had in mind.<br /><br />The earned income tax credit came to mind because that represents the purest transfer of wealth we have in this country, which you claim often does more harm than good. Do you think Medicaid has done more harm than good?<br /><br />I would say that money is often a necessary condition to solve a problem but not sufficient.  Spending money on cancer research and defense does not by itself cure cancer or win wars, but I assume you would not be arguing that we should not spend money on those things, despite the fact that we have not won the war on cancer and have not eliminated the threat of war.<br />Would you argue that programs to help people quit drinking are a failure because people still drink?<br />Or they relapse?<br /><br />There will always be people at the bottom of the income ladder, at the bottom of the bell curve in terms of ability, personality, luck, common sense, intelligence, health or what have you.<br />While it is certainly difficult to help people overcome all of their own personal demons, I think that it is relatively easy to help them with basic physical needs. People keep repeating this claim that this is a large diverse country, but the reality is that when it comes to things like having enough to eat or getting medical care, the needs of people are remarkably similar.<br /><br />The big question for the people who claim that gov't programs only made things worse is - if things were so great before, why did these programs get enacted to begin with?  The argument that social security was a onetime response to the extreme situation of the Great Depression and is no longer necessary has traction only because most people aren't old enough to remember life before social security.  Surely the people who are only too happy to claim that home ownership isn't for everyone should also be willing to acknowledge that 401K plans aren't for everybody, and Health Savings Accounts aren't for everybody.  Not everybody can survive with large fluctuations in their retirement income and not everybody can absorb the costs of unanticipated medical expenses.<br /><br />There are never any guarantees for anything, but certainly the Federal Gov't is in as good a position as anyone to provide a measure of security for those who need it.  Charity is not secure, and is also not sufficient.<br /><br />I think there is an appalling level of dishonesty in the arguments of people who claim that anti-poverty programs make people worse off and that we'd all be better off with less gov't.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2281292, "replies": [], "lft": 410, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/why-so-many-rich-people-dont-feel-very-rich/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3257659, "rgt": 411, "userDisplayName": "Mark", "createDate": "1295474564", "userID": 4196791, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295499882", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295499882", "commentSequence": 183, "commentBody": "You can thank the right for the income inequality.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2314590, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/unemployment-does-not-equal-poverty/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3257743, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Wafa", "createDate": "1295475528", "userID": 9339054, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295499904", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Huntsville, AL", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295499904", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Also, there is no social safety net in most poor countries.

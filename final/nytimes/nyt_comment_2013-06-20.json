It is not unusual to hear about people being struck and killed...yet this city can finance new stadiums .  That is the erosion of fairness. <br/><br/>Charles Murray and David Brooks explaining all the ills in the United States as stemming from hippie culture in the 1960's is just a gigantic distortion. American life was pretty good for white America in the 60's.  Violence came from fighting against racism and from fighting against an illegal war when American Institutions were not responsive enough  and were complicit in the prolongation of war + poverty.<br/>But there was so much good in the 1960's too.  Young people decided that  racism and sexism was just not going to be tolerated anymore. The Democratic party looked more and more like America with the  inspirations of Barbara Jordan, Bobby Kennedy and Frank Church. We were proud of the Peace Corps and Earth Day.<br/><br/>In the 1970's when companies started to close their factories in the little and big towns across America is when the erosion of American culture began.

Too many people focus too much on the fighting itself and forget what the fighting was really all about.  Not states' rights but individual rights -- the ongoing struggle to recognize and enforce by law the equal rights of all humans, regardless of skin tone, ethnicity, gender, etc.  The Confederacy was struggling for the \"right\" of some people to trample on the rights of others, to expand injustice.  The Union may not have been explicitly struggling to undo all the wrongs brought about by slavery, nevertheless its triumph over the Confederacy helped extinguish that blight and ensured that the nation would continue, however slowly and awkwardly, on the path of expanding the rights of all people within the soon to be reunited nation.", "recommendationCount": 22}, {"assetID": 3374559, "replies": [], "lft": 11, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/climb-the-ladder/", "parentID": 9276122, "commentID": 9276401, "rgt": 12, "userDisplayName": "KarmaSartre", "createDate": "1371701104", "userID": 53999991, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1371701168", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Mercer Island", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1371697568", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Boyd.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3374560, "replies": [], "lft": 58, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/our-broken-social-contract/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9276402, "rgt": 59, "userDisplayName": "J.

As a result of this and other reasons, we are failing to compete in the global economy, while other countries have been doing very well, e.g., Germany. I heard one of our Union leaders asking in a TV program why is that Germany can pay those salaries and benefits without outsourcing its production, and we have too.  Why?

Were New York to embark on this project, they'd be the first adopter market for the used batteries from the Leaf and Volt on an alpha test basis so the storage would likely be a freebee. And, as pointed out by Lovins in the book \"Reinventing Fire\" fuel cell vehicles lag electric vehicles by only a few years in becoming cheaper than internal combustion vehicles.  And that happens well before 2030.  So the Jacobson et al. transportation conversion certainly saves money rather than costing extra.  It seems at though the Carnegie group has made the common error of not comparing the alternative cost.  Oil at $200/barrel in say 2023 makes transportation conversion cheap even at a cash-for-clunkers-type pace which retires the gasoline based fleet faster than it wears out.<br/><br/>I suspect that there is a fundamental lack of understanding concerning how distributed generation affects reliability.  Lovins' \"Transform\" scenario is considered the most reliable with intrinsic robustness against extreme weather and large solar flare events.  <br/><br/>Perhaps \"reality check\" is not the correct description for the Carnegie endeavor.

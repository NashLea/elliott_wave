Only people have relations. Countries have interests. US and China interests align in certain areas like making the world economy grow so everyone can get rich. In other areas, like controlling the world's oil supply, they are at odds.<br /><br />I think the best strategy for the US is to enlist China as the junior hegemon. Give China more responsibility. For example, a nuclear and psychotic North Korea is really a Chinese problem far more than an American problem.  Perhaps US should simply withdraw from Korea altogether -- it is far away and very expensive. The Chinese are more than powerful enough to support a major trading partner (south korea) against north korean lunatics.  Giving China that responsibility would possibly help bind them to the loose aggregation of reasonable countries.<br /><br />I think the currency thing should be handled by other western governments who have exactly the same interest as the US in letting the Chinese currency rise against the dollar. Think that it would be far easier to make happen if big hegemon US wasn't pushing so hard.

Don't sneak in and live in the shadows. Learn our language.  Pay taxes just as every American does to support our country. Get an education without taking advantage of the system.  I am of German and Welsh descent, but I AM AN AMERICAN!!!  Until an immigrant can follow the rules and assimilate as an American, they are missing the point of America.  Flouting the rules of immigration, taking advantage of the goodness of this country and refusing to \"become\" American is a slap in the face to all those that HAVE played by the rules.  Anyone coming here can remain proud of their heritage, but  to come here and truly be part of the promise of this country, they must make their first allegiance to AMERICA!...land of the free and home of the brave.

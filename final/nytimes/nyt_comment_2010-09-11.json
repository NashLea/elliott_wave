The juice is not fresh (tastes like bad) but overall it is good value. We paid 75 euros/night. They also offer a private transfer to or from the international airport for 15 euro, or can organise a pickup with the shuttle van on the way back for 5 euro per person.<br /><br />There are many good restaurants in the area and lots of friendly cats about the streets. we liked the Halil ?brahaim Sofrasi restaurant near the Bazaar only a 10 min walk away.

But history's memory extends over centuries, not years, and it would be simply nonsensical for the German-speaking people to continue the ritual of political and cultural hibernation now into the 21st century.

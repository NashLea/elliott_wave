People are literally giving up their blood and soul to stand up to a ruthless dictator, who has ruled for nearly three decades.  These are just ordinary people protesting rising costs, unemployment, corruption among many other things.<br /><br />But wait.... rising costs? unemployment? corruption?.... these are the same issues facing the Western world. But why aren\u2019t we protesting.  We go with our huge armies and introduce \u201cdemocracy\u201d in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet we ourselves are not practicing democracy.<br /><br />\u201cWe\u201d , as in the Western world, have lost that \u201cprotester\u201d mentality that was inside us. Whenever food prices go up we just sit there, whine about it and then accept the fact. Whenever, we drive up to the gas pump, we grumble about how these corporations are just milking our wallets, yet we still pump gas all the time. Actions speak louder than words. Joining a group on facebook or pressing the \u201clike\u201d button really doesn\u2019t cut it. It is just a lazy way of saying, \u201cYes, we know you are stealing our money and we are going to do nothing about it.\u201d My dad used to tell me that when he studied in India, they raised school tuitions fees, which was the equivalent of just $2. Yet they all got together, blocked streets, cornered government officials and had their voices heard.<br /><br /> It\u2019s time we really stand up and fight for what we believe in, shoulder to shoulder just like the Egyptians, Tunisians, Jordanians and many other people from all over the world.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2371193, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/technology/personaltech/03pogue.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3331198, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "Bill", "createDate": "1296710039", "userID": 10707888, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296710118", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Fairfax, VA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296710118", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "This is a great, readable, well-organized review.<br /><br />The only two points I can think of are 1) did Dave really have the phones side-by-side and if so, was there a chance for crosstalk and mutual interference and, more importantly, 2) doesn't Verizon have exlcusive contracts for repeaters that carry cell phone reception inside transport hubs, such as the airport gates and subways?

Just hearing about the level of care that Noah needs in one 24 hour period, not to mention his new special diet, proves that his Mother spends plenty of time with her family. Maybe it is a therapy for her to vent about this, in hopes that it will prevent it from happening to another child. Do you really think she needs/wants people to feel sorry for her or their family? This isn't a pity party. Its not like their page is blanketed with advertisers and they are raking in the dough.<br /><br />If just ONE care provider reads the harm shaking can cause to a child creates a lasting effect in a time of frustration or panic, then she has saved a life. From the number of followers they have, It seems like you may be one of the only people who don't \"get it\". Meanwhile, Trudy also has a website, I guess her husband should spend more time with his daughters, oh wait...he shipped them back to his country...<br /><br />The trial and evidence presented did more justice than any newspaper article can, including testimony from the opposing opinions, one of which makes BIG bucks testifying at these trials all over the US. The jury was loaded with Northern Virginia professionals &amp; parents. They ALL agreed she is guilty. Don't let the media put you your panties in a tizzy and get worked up over the spin of a journalist looking for ratings by leaving important details out of the story. NOT ONE JUROR BELIEVED SHE WAS INNOCENT.<br /><br />As a parent in this situation: Who would YOU believe? A daycare provider or an investigator? A daycare provider or some of the TOP physicians in the world? Of COURSE Trudy didn't want the questioning recorded, DUH! Would ANY guilty party want their admission recorded? Is it too hard to believe the woman SNAPPED? How often do we see stories on Nancy Grace or the news where people SNAP and do crazy things to children? Sad but true. Why doesn't Trudy take a lie detector test?<br /><br />The Whitmers never jumped to conclusions about what happened to Noah. They didn't immediately point fingers at Trudy. But from what the physicians told them combined with what the investigator revealed Trudy admitted, they moved forward in support of THE STATE prosecuting her. As any GOOD parent would, justice for their son. WHAT would you have done?<br /><br />Yes, there may be stories and cases where people were wrongly accused. Yes, SBS is a very controversial subject.  But also keep your mind open to the fact that YES, unfortunately people DO shake babies.

Mubarak might not be very evil, and might have made contribution to Egyptian stability and the Middle East peace, but how presumptuous is he to think that he has the right to rule Egypt for more than three decades and to groom his son for the future? He and his family should leave Egypt, instead of dying on Egyptian soil. I admire the demonstrators\u2019 courage and restraint, but hope that they would be more patient. With such a long and rich history, Egyptians should know that people cannot change history in a short period of time. I am not worried about the rise of Muslim Brothers or the threat to Israeli security, but I do think that Egyptians should not idealize a post-Mubarak Egypt.<br /><br />So far as the US is concerned, I would play the devil\u2019s advocate. Uncle Sam has already done more than enough. We have supported the dictator for so long, and called for restraint and stability not long ago. But the other day President Obama already sent a clear and forcible message that Mubarak should step down. The modern international system, for better or worse, is based on the principles of sovereignty and non-interference. Uncle Sam should not back Mubarak into the corner, so that he would have nothing to lose. We should negotiate a way out for him, letting him leave the country and live a decent life.<br /><br />What is transpiring in Cairo reminds me of what happened in Beijing more than two decades ago. I hope that peace will prevail in Egypt, and wish the bloody clash on the Chinese New Year was only an unfortunate episode that would lead to peace and democracy in Egypt.<br />", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2369675, "replies": [], "lft": 88, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/sports/soccer/03manchester.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3331192, "rgt": 89, "userDisplayName": "Rachida", "createDate": "1296709817", "userID": 14073221, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296710365", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "MD", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296710365", "commentSequence": 27, "commentBody": "I'm sorry, but what have the Yankees, Dolphins and Lakers have to do with the EPL?  Did I miss something here in a column about football (Yes, I know Americans insist on calling it soccer, but the world says FOOTBALL...)?<br /><br />(Yes, Virginia, there is a world beyond the USA-one with many sports and many teams, most of which are multinational in structure and where politics are all but unknown and at the end of the matches the players are all friends.)<br /><br />To the NYT, I ask why this obsession with the EPL?  ManU isn't the only team in the UK any more than EPL is the only league there. As a matter of fact, ManU isn't even the only team in Manchester (that's England, not NH or IN) as someone obliquely mentioned in naming ManCity.<br /><br />Personally I prefer the Rangers of the SPL---and love to watch Madjid Bougherra stop Wayne Ronney dead in his tracks. In fact it gives me great glee to know that only one defender amongst so many is consistently able to stop Rooney. Can't wait until the next meeting between the Rangers and ManU during another UEFA match.<br /><br />One day, I hope, the NYT will get off its anglophile soapbox and share the other teams of not only the UK but of Europe, Africa and beyond with its readers.  How about doing an article on the great rivalry between the Rangers and Celtic, preferably before the Rangers' Walter Smith retires?", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

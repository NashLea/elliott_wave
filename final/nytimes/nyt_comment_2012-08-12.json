But I doubt a world lacking the wealth of the USA would be a barter economy. The world was not entirely a barter economy before the 18th century. The issue at hand is balance. If our civilization is to prosper, citizens need to have a reasonable expectation that the rules apply equitably to all. Mr. Freeman is pointing out that Mr. Romney is a glaring example of how our system is out of balance. Human appetites and desires are key drivers to our overall well being, however, when those most powerful, due to their accumulated wealth, rig (buy) the system in a way that skews the outcomes against the majority, eventually there will be a very uncivil outcome. Most US citizens remain ignorant of just how far out of balance the system has gotten. Those in the Tea Party have a sense of it but they have been slyly co-opted by the wealthy to focus their energy on tearing down the meager barriers that prevent the very wealthy from taking even more control. If the \"truth\" about Romney's wealth is revealed, will citizens will be repelled by the revelation? Will we even get a chance to find out?

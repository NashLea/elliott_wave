It is hard for the seller to compete with some of the prices there, but they are there for the consumer to purchase from, and can easily be recognized, in part, by their more 'realistic' prices.

If you are a shopper who longs for the small time sellers that used to be at Ebay, but are no longer there, look to bonanza.  There are lots of mom and pop operations in that neck of the woods.

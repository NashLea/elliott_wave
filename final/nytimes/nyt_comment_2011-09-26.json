Growing up in the Northeast, I later moved to southeastern Michigan, where, according to H.L. Mencken's \"The American Language,\" the best American English is (or used to be) spoken. My stepson, speaking this sort of English in a highly educated professional level in New York where he now lives and practices law, nevertheless periodically gets teased about his supposed midwestern accent. By New Yorkers and New Jerseyans, no less! Spanish is spoken with radically different accents and dialects in various parts of the world. Just ask a Mexican about the Spanish that is spoken in Cuba and Puerto Rico (where I've also lived), and vice-versa. Next to none of the kids in Arizona whose first language is Spanish will ever speak English with a native American accent, whatever that may be, regardless of what accent their teacher has.  Perhaps, for them, having a teacher who is a native Mexican who made it in the United States will serve to motivate them to do the same.<br/>\nWhile I feel a bit guilty about it, these days I wouldn't be caught dead staying overnight in Arizona.

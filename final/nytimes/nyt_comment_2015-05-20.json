Obama is incredibly treating it  as one of the greatest potential achievements of his second term, if not the greatest achievement.  If that is true, it is a pathetic second term even if you like TTP,   But Obama is emotional about it.  His attack on Warren for opposing it is as passionate as anything he has said.   So does Krugman even mention it is an Obama program.   No.  Instead he attacks William Daley.<br/><br/>Some time in coming weeks, Krugman will say Obama has a great second term.  If it passes, does that not imply his great achievement.<br/><br/>If one wants to influence an Administration, you simply cannot give it a pass on everything.

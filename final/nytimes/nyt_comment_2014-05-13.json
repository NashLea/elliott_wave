With all the history of prior racist activity Sterling was involved with, Doc Rivers comes off as a hypocrite and should keep quiet about this situation. I'm sure he's thinking if he can lead the piling-on he can distract from the fact he willingly came to work for the racist. And the piling on comes at an opportunistic moment when black ownership of an NBA team in a primo market is a real possibility. I'll be that was part of the deal to ensure that this year's playoffs go on: Sterling loses his team (all Sterlings lose their team apparently), and the NBA guaranties black ownership of the Clippers. That's why Magic Johnson keeps piling on as well. I suggest that Mrs Sterling get in touch with Al Davis' legal team if she wants any shot at retaining ownership. I'm not in any way excusing Sterling's comments. But I think a more considered approach would be to treat him like a deluded old man losing her mind and pity him. Do what the NFL did to Eddie D - take control of the team from him. I don't know if it's right to take the team from his estranged wife. Actually, I'll bet it would be a greater punishment for Sterling if he loses ownership to his wife, is banned from all NBA arenas, and has to watch her run the team on TV.

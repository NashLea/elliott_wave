Indeed, talented and intelligent officers would pose a threat to the government, so they were pushed to the side.  Maliki assumed that the army would not really have to fight anybody.  <br/><br/>We had the same problems building the South Vietnamese army.  It did, of course, have to fight, and we were there to rescue it when it did poorly, and do most of the heavy lifting.  So we did the fighting and the South Vietnamese government used the army for patronage and regime stability.  <br/><br/>We were Uncle Sucker in Vietnam, and some want us to be snookered in Iraq too.  Unfortunately, creating a moderate army is going to be very difficult.  Such an army threatens Assad more than ISIS.  Forced to choose between him and ISIS, most Syrians will choose him.  Between him and a believable moderate coalition, the choice will go the other way.  So Assad will try to get somebody else to take care of ISIS while he keeps the moderates divided and impotent.  <br/><br/>ISIS's ideas come ultimately from Salafism and the Saudis.  We need to encourage them to go after Mecca; then and only then will the Saudis fight.  And they might well lose, but at least things would for once be clear in the Mideast.

Canada's spending cuts came in a period of general economic expansion and were apparently the result of high interest rates on Canadian Bonds. In addition, they most certainly didn't slash their tax revenue at the same time. Pretty textbook stuff, the economic boom...not the bust...is the time for public fiscal restraint.<br/>The current context is completely different. There has been a global recession/stagnation since 2008. Interest rates are the lowest they have ever been on US bonds. Austerity in a depressed economic environment only will lead to more economic stagnation (And the EU zone is giving everyone a clear case study.)<br/>Finally, if conservatives are so taken by what Canada did in the 1990s, they need only look to the Clinton years. We did the same thing, which resulted in budget surpluses by 2000.

First, please look at the borders of Bangladesh (BD) with Myanmar. These two countries share very few miles of border. Myanmar borders India, so does BD. It is extremely unlikely that significant numbers of BD refugees in 1971 went to Myanmar - they didn't.<br/>Second, international borders like now are relatively recent phenomenon. There were always some Rohingyas in Myanmar, just as there are Nagas and others ethnically close to some Myanmar tribes in India. Rohingyas are predominantly Burmese citizens, or should be.<br/>Third, yes, during the British period some Indian Muslims from what is today's BD did go over to Myanmar and they were ethnically the same as the Rohingyas. But even that is a 100 yrs back. Hence by all accounts Rohingyas are people of the land of Myanmar.<br/>Now, I do not know if Suu Kyi is not keeping deliberately silent about the Rohingyas so as not to lose power, which would be disastrous for Myanmar, since power would shift to the military again.

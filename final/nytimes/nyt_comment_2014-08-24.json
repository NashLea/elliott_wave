Ku Klux Klan, Stalin, and other political extremists with Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and other religious extremists share a sense of self righteousness that is intolerant of willful behavior of others that fails to conform to their strict definitions of human behavior. Even among themselves extremists are intolerant. <br/><br/>The motive isn't in philosophy, theology or political ideology but in the psychological framework on which all else human is suspended.<br/><br/>In our age most don't pay attention to Karl Jung, Otto Rank, Wilhelm Reich, and their peers, but all of them cited the foundations on which rest the calamities of man: terror of death, fear of life, or at least its untidy unpredictability, and obsession with controlling all by the assertion of institutions of their own making.<br/><br/>The fear of extremists may be what you call liberal democracy. But as assuredly there are among terrorists individuals who fear the failure of fellow terrorists to conform. <br/><br/>Christianity splits from early \"Jewish Christianity;\" Roman and Orthodox Catholics split; Reformation and War of religion.

We have been attacked as clearly as we were on 12 7 41 and 9 11 01.  We need to do what we did after Pearl Harbor, not what we did after the Twin Towers.

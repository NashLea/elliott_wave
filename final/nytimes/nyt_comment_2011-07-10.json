Money supply theory has proven its ineptness.  Obama stimulus #1 spent too much money papering local and state governments and not enough in infrastructure.  If money supply and Reaganomics (low tax and less regulation) worked, where are the jobs?  I support another stimulus on infrastructure projects.  If Republicans had allowed it originally, those projects would have been ready now, a few years later, but Republicans could not wait.  I see horrible short term thinking on the part of the Republicans.  \r<br/><br/>First, we need to think about globalization and its cost and benefits to our society.  Labor costs in other countries could be 20 times cheaper than the US.  How do we reconcile this fact?  How can we save good jobs here in the US and still be competitive?   Republicans want to derail unions, but unions allowed the high school graduate to support his/her family, send his children to college, own homes and pursue happiness.  Minimum wage jobs do not support families.  We are busy lowering our standard of living for the middle class while the rich are getting far richer.  Does this approach work for a society?  \r<br/><br/>This seems clear to me:  if people do not have jobs, they do not spend.  If people do not spend, businesses do not make products.

They say that businesses do not grow with too much uncertainty and regulation.  No such thing, businesses grow when they have consumers buying their products and they expect profit.  Cutting government just cuts more jobs and we go into a downhill spiral.\r<br/><br/>My concern:  Republicans win the presidency.

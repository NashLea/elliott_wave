Economists have failed to educate the public in terms that they can understand. Economists behave as if believe the average citizen doesn't have the smarts to understand even basic economics. (Ditto for climatologists.) This is an arrogant attitude, and it is not true. The lack of economic education of the population has placed society in a position where the public can be hoodwinked by spokespeople for the wealthy.<br/><br/>2. For the past four decades, the track record of the economy, and therefore the economists, has been abysmal in the United States. Economists set the bar for themselves very low. They consider 5% unemployment to be full employment. At that level the average worker has no bargaining power, so the wealth has been steadily shifting to the industry barons. For the past four decades, whenever there has been a whiff of inflation, economists have elevated unemployment to reduce consumer demand to tame inflation. This is bad economic policy, and is why the public rightfully concludes that economist don't know what they are doing.<br/><br/>The solution (aside: economists also have a deplorable lack of solutions, just a lot of griping) is to educate the public and improve your track record.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3407715, "replies": [], "lft": 930, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-conflict.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 12440730, "rgt": 931, "userDisplayName": "blgreenie", "createDate": "1406859362", "userID": 13992602, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1406865948", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1406862348", "commentSequence": 12440730, "commentBody": "The Israeli press reports that 85% of the Hamas tunnels are destroyed.

Israel happens to live very well with its Christian citizens-compare that to any Arab country-and fairly well with its Moslem citizens. Israeli Arabs have issues they need to resolve, as some totally reject the Jewish state, but insist on keeping their Israeli benefits; a one way street, and pathetic at that. The extremists are mostly on the Palestinian side; why don't you mention the foreign aid to them that gets squandered on supporting terrorist families even in the \"moderate\" W.Bank?

She has over 200 nuclear weapons and the unconditional backing of the most powerful and rich country in the history of the world (the U.S).  On the other side, it is a pitiful resistance movement with primitive homemade rockets which have managed to cause 3 deaths after 3000 tries (a death rate of 0.01%).  Cars are more deadly than these non-deadly rockets.  As for the rhetoric, nobody should believe any rhetoric - whether noble or horrific - that comes from state actors or resistance fighters.  If you have some time, compare the rhetoric of Irgun (Israel's pre-state terror (freedom fighter?) group with Hamas, the rhetoric isn't distinguishable.  What we have is a structural issue: prisoner vs warden, kidnapped vs. captive, government vs resister, terrorist vs state and on and on.  It is not good vs evil.  When there was no Israel, there was Irgun; when there was no US there the colonial patriots (called terrorists by UK); and when there was no Palestine there was (is) Hamas.

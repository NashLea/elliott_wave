The ratings are always fun to consider though they are of little importance at this point since the tryout system which the coach has embarked upon will gradually sort out who can play versus the players who have yet to learn to play at this level.  The MLS players, some of whom are fine athletes, are so far behind those who play overseas that they hurt their chances of making the starting eleven no matter how hard they try, since they do not understand the basics,  through inexperience and quite likely shoddy coaching as they came up through the US soccer system.<br/><br/>The basics are emerging and quite possibly will pay dividends in the World Cup qualifying.  The difference between the decent efforts under Bob Bradley and the game which Klinsmann is attempting to instill is immense.<br/><br/>The team is emerging at last.

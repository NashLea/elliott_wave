Perhaps or perhaps not. The claim involves three pairs of trend lines, one for each type of institution.  In the top line of each pair - the sticker price - the trend is up - fueled by a grasping hand and tempered by trustees and state boards of higher ed.  The key to Scott-Clayton's analysis is the bottom line of each pair, which reflects the transaction price - what is actually paid.  She notes a buckle in each bottom line such that the trend declines modestly after the 2007-2008 year.  Since the transaction price declines, college is cheaper than you think!<br/><br/>But is it?   The point of the bottom trend line in each pair is that after adjusting for parental income and assets, the price paid is adjusted downwards from the list to reflect what can be paid by the student and parents.  But whether the price paid is actually \"cheaper\" in a world of price discrimination depends on whether your income and assets have changed (and is to be made by the one who pays not the professor).  If they have not changed and the price declines, then education is cheaper.  But if your income and assets also have declined, then college may not be cheaper, even with a reduced price.  It could even be more expensive if a student and his parents have suffered a larger percentage decrease in income and assets than the tuition has declined -- and if the \"calculators\" are biased.  The price paid alone does not say whether the education is cheaper - except trivially - without considering the incomes/assets of those paying.<br/><br/>Did anything happen following 2007-2008 that might suggest that applicants have suffered significant losses in income, stock values, home values, etc.?

I think there is a continuum--normal, every day regrets like missing out on a great sales event, to deep regrets that are often mixed with self-loathing and difficulty grieving lost opportunities. I have found that when regret cannot be handled alone or in talking with friends, a therapeutic experience like being part of a support group, having individual therapy, or a mixture of the two can help people work through regrets and find greater peace. I think one of the most important aspects of dealing with regret is to remember to be compassionate with ourselves. I try to remind myself of this daily.

But 95% of the time, it's dead wrong.

Period.  Simple. There is no point to our trying to grab Libyan oil.  The government doesn't just take it.

Oh, wait--I know!  By SELLING OIL ON THE WORLD MARKET.  \r<br><br>So suppose Qadafy says \"None of this oil can go to the U.S.\"  Well, heaven forbid!  We would then have to buy more oil from Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Venezuela, Bahrain, Kuwait, Russia ... the list goes on and on.  And if Qadafy were selling oil to someone else to fuel his expensive tastes, then that someone else is not bidding against us for all that other oil.  \r<br><br>In other words, an embargo doesn't work without a whole lot of fatcat, need-the-money oil producers going along.  We don't need to \"control\" Libya's oil.  If it goes on the market, it adds to the supply, and we get the oil we want.  Period.  \r<br><br>That is how markets work.  You don't go to war for oil anymore.  \r<br><br>Now if a country were taking over the private property of American oil producing companies (an event we have not seen any reporting on in Libya), then the U.S. government might have to take action to help them.

I've since had a career in operations, technology and finance, got an MBA, and do mergers and acquisitions for a living.<br/><br/>But while Econ set the stage in many ways, my Art History and other humanities courses have been incredibly valuable to me professionally. I go back to the humanities mindset whenever I engage with the whole \"creative\" side of business - product design, marketing, HR, even engineering (try telling programmers they're not creative!). If paintings and novels are tools for communicating and influencing, then training in the humanities helps us understand how they work. Today, I can have a conversation with Marketing where I ask \"what's the ROI on this campaign going to be\" but I can also give informed feedback on design, fit to brand, and so on. My finance-only colleagues typically have to sit that one out.<br/><br/>While I am professionally more versatile for having studied the arts, I believe I'm also happier. I can have great conversations with a wide range of colleagues delving into their fields with more informed curiosity. I get excited to think about people's motivations and psychology, so important to the human endeavor of Management. This is practical but also just plain fun, stimulating, gratifying, and meaningful.

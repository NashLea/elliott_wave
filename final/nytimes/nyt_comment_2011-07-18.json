Of course things changed after Cheney couldn't return. The frustration we are feeling is somewhat like what the French endured -- playing beautifully for a disappointing result.  Of course, that's soccer sometimes. But this was the USWNT's best effort in terms of holding the ball and keeping the initiative early in the game. <br/><br/>@TDK #141 &amp; Jesse S. #148 -- Fervently agree...with 20-20 HINDSIGHT.  But without benefit of that I think you must give Sundhage more credit for the promotion of Rapinoe and Morgan than demerits for Heath...which indeed did prove a blunder. As to why Pia made that decision, my  speculation is that it was due to Rapinoe's involvement/ interference with a clearance in front of goal late. The US got lucky but you could see the defender looking askance up at her, as if to say \"What on earth are you doing to me!\"  It's also possible Sundhage just thought her legs were blown. But Heath certainly didn't hold the ball well and failed to put a shot on frame in the wake of the red card restart.  It was a bad idea to let her take one of the 5 kicks at the end with Morgan and O'Reilly available.  It was even a worse idea to let Boxx lead off again after what happened against Brazil. THAT may have been the straw that broke the camel's back in retrospect.<br/><br/>But this minutia shouldn't obscure a brilliant effort that just came up short against an equally brilliant and marginally more inspired team. The future with players like Rapinoe and Morgan on the way is bright. But more than anything I think we should be celebrating not just the play of Abby Wambach -- but the woman herself.  She never stood taller than fielding those galling questions -- \"How much does it hurt? Whose do you blame? How come you weren't perfect?\"  As long as we're producing female athletes of such quality I think US sports is doing well. She's a real champion!

I don't know what our options are at holding mid because 1) not much coverage of the women's game outside of tournaments, and 2) Sundhage keeps playing the same people over and over again (where have we heard that before?). Lindsey and Averbuch are the obvious options, and I don't think either played less well than Boxx or Lloyd, especially in limited minutes. Heath is supposed to have some skill on the ball: maybe, but I haven't seen it in game time, and the speed of her decision making is slower than Christian Chivu in deep-sea diving boots.<br/><br/>Have to say, maybe the thing that most impressed me about Japan was that we completely took them out of their game (with some help from themselves) -- and they still managed to find a way to win.

You are a resident in general surgery.  <br/><br/>An adult with a history of Peptic Ulcers secondary to Helicobacter pylori presents to the ER at 6 AM with severe abdominal pain radiating to the back.  Movement worsens the pain. Temp is 100 degrees F, BP is 105/60 mmHg, pulse is 120 bpm, and respiration is 22 breaths per min.The patient lies flat and motionless.Upon examination, the patient exhibits marked tenderness when the ER doctor palpates the abdomen superficially, and the patient protests deeper palpation. The ER doctor orders labs, Xrays, and surgical consult.The nurse draws the labs and establishes I.V. access. Before the lab results return, you arrive through the back entrance and happen to see a standing Chest Xray showing pneumoperitoneum that a med student indicates as \u201cfree air.\u201d When you examine the patient, your findings are the same as the ER doctor.<br/><br/>Which is the correct answer in the real world:<br/><br/>A)Recommend fluids intravenously and wait for the labs<br/>\nB)Recommend blood cultures and antibiotics intravenously<br/>\nC)Recommend a stool sample with heme occult test<br/>\nD)Recommend an EKG with serial serum cardiac enzymes<br/>\nE)Recommend a CT Scan of the chest and abdomen<br/>\nF)Recommend an Upper Endoscopy<br/>\nG)Recommend intubation and admission to the Intensive Care Unit<br/>\nH)Arrange for immediate surgery (Exploratory Laparotomy)<br/>\nI)Sign off the consult until appropriate for the surgical team<br/>\nJ)Review the patient\u2019s insurance<br/>\nK)Answers A, C, &amp; J<br/><br/>The correct answer is H.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.  A right is universal, exists without action by the government and the most a government can do is protect the right and allow it to be exercised.  A government cannot create a right, as they are natural, but it can create an entitlement.  EMTLA is neither.  It is, as was the \"national speed limit\" of 55 mph, an exercise of the power of the purse.  A hospital has to provide care only if it is a participating member, i.e. is reimbursed by the government for any services.  A private hospital refusing Federal payments (yeah, right) is free to disregard EMTLA.<br/>\nSome might call the distinction moot, but it is very real.  Allowing people to think they have a right to something they do not creates false expectations which leads to frustration and then anger.  If, as the writer states, there exists a right to emergency treatment, then why are hospitals allowed to close emergency rooms which lose money?

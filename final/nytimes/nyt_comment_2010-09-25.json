After all, Coburn was so concerned with \"inalienable rights\" when grilling Elena Kagan, perhaps they plan on pulling a Glenn Beck so that they can \"take back\" women's rights for themselves the way Beck wanted so much to restore civil rights, albeit for white rightwingers.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm sure that's the idea. Because guys like DeMint and don't have enough rights already. They might as well claim women's rights for themselves.

Have women morphed into the old clich\u00e9 once applied to blacks, they all are the same when it comes to honoring their achievements?

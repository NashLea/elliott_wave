The other stretching exercises I've been given over the past 5 painful months didn't hurt at all!  The first day, it was like someone was stabbing/slashing my foot with knives.  What was worse though was when my calf was all knotted up and practically seized up on me the next day.  I realized I should have stretched my calf out really well before and after!  By the time I did the exercise 2 days later, I was stretching my calf out really well, no more calf problems and the 2nd time, It really hurt, but not as much. After the 2nd exercise session, my pain started subsiding, finally getting better after 5 months!   My doc has me in a boot right now as well, so I am not putting any pressure on the plantar fascia at all. I was in a boot for 3 weeks before this and while that felt slightly improved, as soon as I tried not wearing the boot, I was in the same amount of pain as before. (It felt like I stepped on a nail and the nail was still in the heel of my foot.) After 4 of these exercise sessions, when I press on my heel now, I barely feel any pain.

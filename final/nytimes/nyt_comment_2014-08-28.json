I'm a progressive who favors much tighter restrictions on guns but also finds the amount of pearl clutching on this topic frustrating. It's an Olympic sport for heaven's sake. No, 9 year olds should not be firing Uzi's. But target practice with .22's at a shooting range is perfectly appropriate. I personally have no interest in shooting but was happy to congratulate my son on the award he won at the camp rifle range nonetheless.

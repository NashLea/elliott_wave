Direct and provocative. But also, in my view, a bit one-sided.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI believe the author undermines the energy and enthusiasm, and the potential, of recent graduates / post-graduates in India.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFor me, a very valid question is this: What is the corporate world doing to change some of these things?<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n- How many management trainee programs (and some are REALLY elaborate and expensive) have a module on effective communication (in English). From what I know, very few.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n- Problem-solving: I don't disagree that the rote-memorization 'method' has killed the education system, but how many companies engage fresh graduates in roles / tasks that require them to solve problems? Most of them are tasked with basic admin or tedious/routine fieldwork or project coordination. If the education system fails to instil this ability, the corporate world does little to find it.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n- Asking questions: We shouldn't undermine the fact that in their early twenties, most people are likely to be quite overwhelmed by the cold setting and the apparent hierarchies that most employers offer. Shouldn't the hiring managers make more of an effort?<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n- Job-hopping and salary negotiations are realities across job levels in organizations. When people are young, they need more guidance around what's important for them, and where they can find it. Are employers interested in working on that?<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI like that the author addresses the matter - but I feel that blaming only the graduates is na\u00efve.

I see nothing wrong with the changes. I'm a product of the public school system and I had to take a remedial math course. I took school seriously. I studied hard and graduated on time. <br/><br/>This is a good thing. One of the main reasons I opted for a private college over a CUNY for my bachelors was because of the poor reputation of the schools due to open enrollment. Who wants a degree that isn't worth the paper it's written on? When I attended BMCC most of my classmates showed up and did the work but a significant portion showed up for the financial aid checks. They were disruptive in class and usually dropped out in Nov or April after funds were dispersed. <br/><br/>Parenting matters. My parents were poor immigrants and our family was a bit dysfunctional. However education was pushed and disrespecting a teacher was a major punishable offense. <br/><br/>My children attend public school and we supplement their education by teaching them at home. Hooked on phonics is good. Use the public library. Take the kids to museums and spend a few dollars on a workbook or two. Make them speak properly. Instill respect for teachers, get involved in their school work, and don't expect the public school system to do all of the educating. <br/><br/>It works.

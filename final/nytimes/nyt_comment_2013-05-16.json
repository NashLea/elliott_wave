The CIA dispatched a team of armed CIA agents to go to the State Department facility, rescue as many of the State Department personnel as it could, and return to the more heavily guarded CIA facility.  Under attack, they could not find either the Ambassador or his body, and left without him.<br/><br/>After they got back to the CIA facility, it too came under attack.  The attackers outnumbered the defenders, and also had medium weapons, including at least one mortar.  A mortar round killed two of the CIA personnel, both of them former Navy SEALs, who were defending the facility.<br/><br/>Soon after, a convoy of CIA vehicles left the CIA facility, carrying both State Department and CIA personnel, fought their way through the encirclement of the CIA facility, and escaped to Tripoli.  <br/><br/>The \"talking points\" issue is nonsense.

Taking the woman's number is not clear-cut line cutting - the letter writer did not insert herself in the line, therefore bumping everyone behind her back one place.  She merely substituted herself for the woman who was leaving.  Imagine the letter writer's original number was 27 and her new number was 15.  Nothing had changed for those with numbers 16-26.  However, those with numbers 28 and up would all move up one position, as the LW would have already left and not replied to the call for her number.  As I see it, it's basically a wash - the line was shortened at some point due to the woman's leaving and the LW taking her spot.  Whether this occurs for #16 or #28 really doesn't make a difference.  Take the number, consider yourself lucky, and, perhaps, try to pay it forward at some point.<br/><br/>As for question #2, I wholeheartedly disagree with the Ethicist.  The co-worker should absolutely pay the $30 fine and not expense it.  The only reason she considered expensing it is because it was attached to the rental car receipt (a detail which I find dubious at best) and she felt no one would notice.

Soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland immediately began wresting itself out of the Finlandization straightjacket. It made a mad dash for EU membership, formally joining the organization in 1995. And while opposition to NATO membership has usually enjoyed support from a plurality of Finns over the past 25 years, the annexation of Crimea has turned the debate on its head; immediately after taking office, the country\u2019s new Prime Minister said that the country ought to have joined the alliance back when it entered the European Union nearly two decades ago. \u201cWhen the Cold War ended, Finland dropped this policy directly and the Finns themselves are ashamed that they had to be so submissive to the Soviet Union\u201d, says Stefan Olsson, Director of the Stockholm Free World Forum think tank. \u201cI have not heard any Finnish foreign policy expert advocating this as a solution to the Ukraine situation.\u201d", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3407560, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 12421873, "replies": [], "commentID": 12421893, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Mike Bru", "createDate": "1406694092", "userID": 67971277, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1406730626", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Big Al", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Glen Cove, N.Y.", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1406727026", "commentSequence": 12421893, "commentBody": "This will ultimately be a good thing for Argentina.

As to the deal term allegedly in the discounted bond deal, that if the hold-outs are paid in full, the holders of discounted bonds must be paid as well, what a stupid deal term.   Certainly Argentina's American lawyers and investment bankers understood the meaning of that deal term.   But did the leaders of Argentina's government?   I suspect the answer is \"Yes\" and that the Cristina Fernandez Administration simply decided to kick that problem down the road, to be resolved at a later time.   It appears the time is now.   When an expert says \"the cost of settling with holdouts and everyone else who still has unpaid bonds is vastly greater than the costs of having to take a default\".

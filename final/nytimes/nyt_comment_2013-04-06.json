In Texas, where the legislature meets only once every two years, you can have a state senator for the price of a 22 oz. steak dinner and three or four bottles of Shiner Bock. Thing is, state legislators, being short termers with other jobs, are often anxious to sell, creating competition for those willing to buy.<br/><br/>The income tax is the mighty force propelling Washington, DC, and the main reason Republicans hate Washington. To have a big, powerful nation, with a big powerful military, we had to have some means of raising money as fast as it could be printed. The power of that taxation, and the general unwillingness of most people to destroy the benefits they receive in order to take away from others, made the federal govt. into a juggernaut. The Republicans have been trying to dismantle it from the 1930s till now and still haven't found the formula.

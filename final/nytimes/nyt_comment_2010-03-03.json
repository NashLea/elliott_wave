It is important to recognise that there are two completely different categories of data set that are involved in the CRU e-mail exchanges:<br /><br />\u00b7 those compiled from direct instrumental measurements of land and ocean surface temperatures such as the CRU, GISS and NOAA data sets; and<br /><br />\u00b7 historic temperature reconstructions from measurements of \u2018proxies\u2019, for example, tree-rings.<br /><br />4. The second category relating to proxy reconstructions are the basis for the conclusion that 20th century warming is unprecedented. Published reconstructions may represent only a part of the raw data available and may be sensitive to the choices made and the statistical techniques used. Different choices, omissions or statistical processes may lead to different conclusions. This possibility was evidently the reason behind some of the (rejected) requests for further information.<br /><br />5. The e-mails reveal doubts as to the reliability of some of the reconstructions and raise questions as to the way in which they have been represented; for example, the apparent suppression, in graphics widely used by the IPCC, of proxy results for recent decades that do not agree with contemporary instrumental temperature measurements.<br /><br />6. There is also reason for concern at the intolerance to challenge displayed in the e-mails. This impedes the process of scientific \u2018self correction\u2019, which is vital to the integrity of the scientific process as a whole, and not just to the research itself. In that context, those CRU e-mails relating to the peer-review process suggest a need for a review of its adequacy and objectivity as practised in this field and its potential vulnerability to bias or manipulation.<br /><br />7. Fundamentally, we consider it should be inappropriate for the verification of the integrity of the scientific process to depend on appeals to Freedom of Information legislation. Nevertheless, the right to such appeals has been shown to be necessary. The e-mails illustrate the possibility of networks of like-minded researchers effectively excluding newcomers...<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 113}, {"assetID": 1217516, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/science/earth/03climate.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1643447, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Cate Berlin", "createDate": "1267593130", "userID": 41711295, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267593728", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Malmo, Sweden", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267593728", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "First, win the nomenclature war.

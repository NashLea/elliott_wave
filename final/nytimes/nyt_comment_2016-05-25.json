Each grouping of strngs of n bit pairs thus contains  n - 1 binary numbers (the 2-bit strings) in that group.  <br/><br/>In the above example the number list count 10 = 4*5/2 is also the sum of the first 4 sets of consecutive 2-bit integers, and each member of the last group is a string 5 bits long.<br/><br/>Since the 50th number is asked for, and the cumulative number of bit strings (as each group sequence is formed) goes like 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55, the 50th number must therefore be an 11 bit string.

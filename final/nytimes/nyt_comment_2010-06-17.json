The above says it all. The unemployed lose COBRA subsidies, the $25 extra a week (which was a life line), no extension in benefits (no new tier) and more days go by when the benefits expired over two weeks ago. But, the winners here, hedge fund managers who can fund campaigns fro Congress. Another glaring example that Congress represents those who have the most wealth, and their actions on legislation since January, 2009, were spending bills and new laws that help the special interests, well connected, but not the people.<br /><br />By the way, what this article does not mention is that Congress approved extending the home buyer's credit today. More money for people who don't need it and less money for people who do. What a travesty.<br /><br />Finally, I'm glad that I finally got a job and I hope I never have to see unemployment benefits ever again. Funny, Congress created the climate for unemployment and they are punishing the unemployed because of their own self serving actions by providing benefits to their benefactors.

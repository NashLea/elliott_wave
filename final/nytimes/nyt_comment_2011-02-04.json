These books don't liberate girls from the princess stranglehold; at best they defy it, and in fact it sounds as if \"play with\" it is a more accurate description.<br /><br />As an unreconstructed-and-proud tomboy (and mom to two boys), I've been delighted to see that there are still plenty of real-live tomboys among my sons' female friends and classmates.  Corporations like Disney -- and media like this blog -- would seem to have us believe the tomboy species had gone extinct.<br /><br />So here are some great books for girls that have nothing to do with princesses (and which are also great for boys):<br /><br />Swallows and Amazons (and the other 12 books in the series)<br /><br />The Greene Poodles<br /><br />Pippi Longstocking (many books in the series)<br /><br />Heidi<br /><br />Little Women (I know, except for the end -- tell them they're free to ignore that part)<br /><br />Nancy Drew mysteries<br /><br />The Bridge to Terabithia<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird<br /><br />That's just off the top of my head, I'm sure there are many others.<br /><br />I also encourage parents of prissy girls (I won't use the terms \"girly,\" \"girly-girl,\" \"feminine,\" \"femmy\" etc. because prissiness has nothing to do with being a \"girl\" or \"female\" -- i.e., having two X chromosomes, a uterus, etc. -- and the terms therefore contain the implicit assertion that female gender roles are biologically determined rather than the social constructs they are) to get their daughters involved in skiing, especially downhill.  As a group, skier girls (just as they were when I was a kid) continue to be very down-to-earth about things like hair, nails and make-up, since skiing tends to mess all that up, but for a great reason -- it's fun! -- that kids can immediately recognize on a gut level.  But skier girls also tend to go for a very pretty look that will be appealing even to prissy girls.  (Plus, in my experience, parents gain street cred with their kids when they take them skiing, lasting into the teen years and beyond, so that they won't tune you out when you talk to them about drugs, etc.)<br /><br />And I recommend Japanese anime, which typically features strong female protagonists (and is enjoyed by boys and girls alike).  *Any* of the children's films of Hayao Miyazaki, especially \"Spirited Away,\" \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" or \"My Neighbor Totoro,\" will include a great role model for girls and is a great place to start.  (But note that his \"Princess Mononoke\" is for adults and has a good bit of violence.)<br />", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 2373897, "replies": [], "lft": 146, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/the-princess-wears-plaid/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3336256, "rgt": 147, "userDisplayName": "R", "createDate": "1296796111", "userID": 33055354, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296796536", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Austin, TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296796536", "commentSequence": 73, "commentBody": "Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching novels (The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith, I Shall Wear Midnight) are awesome.

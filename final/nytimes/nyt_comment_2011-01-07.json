I cannot imagine a legitimate justification for this recission.  Patients and families are eager for this information, and it is important to them that it be available. Most want to understand their conditions and the options available to them.  It is also invaluable to their physicians and other health care providers to know and understand their preferences.  None of us want to cause unnecessary discomfort nor, for that matter, would we want to experience it ourselves. I can think of no reason why this option to be informed and participate in decisions should not be provided to those who want it. One could argue that it should not require financial incentives to accomplish this, but we live in a fee for service environment and there is no doubt that providing a fee will likely encourage the service.<br /><br />Indeed, it is unethical and contrary to our Hippocratic Oath not to ask patients and their families what they would want to have done at all stages of illness.  We all obtain \"informed consent\" and discuss alternative options before tests and procedures. End of life care should be no different.  What if not having such discussions, with resulting unnecessary pain and suffering for the patient and unnecessary costs to the family were considered grounds for malpractice? Perhaps that would encourage practitioners to have these discussions without payment.  But this is not a financial problem but rather a human one.<br /><br />Speaking as a heart failure specialist who has worked with many patients with this chronic condition, there is a wide spectrum of potential management approaches for patients with severe heart failure who have not responded to optimal treatment regimens.  These range from experimental drugs to device implantation, mechanical assist devices, and transplantation.  These patients face many important choices that that should involve patients and their families.<br /><br />In my view, this recision of support for meaningful end of life discussions reflects a lack of courage on the part of those responsible, and they should be very ashamed of themselves.  In short, appropriate and ethical decisions have been defeated by dishonest sound bites (e.g., \"death panels\") and a lack of courage by our leaders.  For this, everyone (patients, families, medical personnel who will have to participate in patients' unnecessary suffering, and the public which will have to ultimately pay for the exorbitant costs of end of life care) will suffer.<br />", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2261588, "replies": [], "lft": 588, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/us/07military.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3183332, "rgt": 589, "userDisplayName": "Andrew", "createDate": "1294378208", "userID": 4215053, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294378506", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294378506", "commentSequence": 256, "commentBody": "The grotesque military budgets in this country are A) an enormous works project for the military-industrial complex, and B) and enormous jobs program.

We have tried all the usual fiscal and monetary methods in an effort to jump-start our economy again.<br /><br />We have had extended tax cuts, massive deficit stimulus spending of $1.3 trillion per year, quantative easing, short-term bank interest rates of 0-.25 percent, our government buying banks bad assets, etc.  But, our economy still struggles and is unable to recover.  And we still have extremely high unemployment of nearly 10 percent, with no hope of much improvement for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />By now, it is obvious that we are not in a normal recession.  Monetary policies are not going to return our sick economy to health.  We are suffering from structural economic decline, caused by sending thousands of factories and millions of jobs to China.<br /><br />Most people do not realize that because of something called the multiplier effect, when a factory closes, it affects many workers who do not directly work at the factory that closed.<br /><br />The multiplier effect is the ratio or number of new jobs created indirectly when a new factory opens.  It varies from about 2 to 4 new jobs created for each one new worker hired directly by the factory.  But, the multiplier effect also comes into play when a factory closes and moves to China.  Many more workers lose their jobs when a factory closes than just the number of factory workers who were directly fired by the factory.<br /><br />By sending tens of thousands of factories and millions of jobs to China and elsewhere, many more millions of American workers have lost their jobs, or had their incomes decrease, because of the multiplier effect.<br /><br />This economic blight is spreading across our entire economy, with the resulting loss of tax revenue for our federal, state, and local governments.  Unless we grow our economy and our tax base, our only choices are more deficit spending or cut government spending for much-needed services.<br /><br />And the downward spiral will continue until our politicians take strong action and bring our factories and jobs back to America.

No one knows for sure, but I think we are about to find out the hard way once they go to the bank to cash their paycheck.<br /><br />The state did not escape the recession, but we have experienced a delayed impact due to many of the reasons cited in the column. Many of us know people who have lost jobs and struggled to replace their income with the new jobs being created, and recent headlines in the local papers have shown an increase in foreclosures showing up in our largest growth areas recently.<br /><br />The stories of repeated requests to cut budgets at every state agency, including prisons (that is a serious sign here in death row valley) and universities only netted a couple of billion. The GOP and \"Good Hair\" Governor Perry have sworn to not raise taxes and to cut the fat from a government their party has run exclusively for over a decade, yet they were successful in getting a majority in both houses of the legislature along with the re-election of GWB's successor. They have a lot of smoke and mirrors on order, but not enough to cover this hole, and we Texans are going to be seeing some fancy two-stepping over the next two years.<br /><br />The one issue to raise income that seems to be getting a lot of trial balloons (based on multiple phone polls I have received, and some local paper articles) is an expansion of gambling. The lottery is showing declining revenue, and there is even one legislator who proposed abolishing it despite the loss in revenue, but there seems to be jockeying for everything from full-blown casinos in many of the larger cities to allowing slots at the few race tracks that have survived many years of indifferent attendance. There is even faint hope the legislature may permit the Native American tribes back into the games the attorney general shut down a few years ago - even in spite of certain creative lobbying efforts that led to other scandals but no progress for the tribes in the Piney Woods and El Paso areas. Even with these possibilities, and the hope to bring back revenue flowing out to state-line casinos in Oklahoma (One near Dallas claims to be the third-largest in the world now), Louisiana and New Mexico, there is not $20 billion to be found there. I would suspect a few prime pieces of public parkland, sponsorships for the public restrooms left on the highways (many already closed and razed recently) and other public gems may be available via online bidding sites before September, where the real fun begins with the new fiscal year. We all hope the new \"lege\" finds time between their planned Arizona-style immigration rants and Voter ID bills to look at the numbers and to put real effort into adult, balanced conversations that are not partisan but are proactive.

This is counterintuitive when one analyzes the data side by side with the overall civilian population in the United States. An indexed chart, using the January 2000 level as a baseline demonstrates that while the US population has been climbing at a fairly steady arithmetic growth rate, the civilian labor force, which should track the changes in the actual population, has been behaving in an erratic pattern, having more to do with BLS data interpretation and the nuances of the business cycle than demographics. Which is why when reindexing data for nominal changes in the US rate of population growth, yields some troubling variations from the just disclosed 9.9% unemployment rate. Basing the adjustment to the unemployment rate on nothing but a statistical regression to the growth of America over the past ten years, would yield an unemployment rate of 15.7%. More troubling is that the underemployment rate would be a number far higher than the 17.6% disclosed for August 2010. According to our calculations, a reading closer to 23% would be more appropriate to represent the level of real joblessness in the US.<br />The reason why unemployment is and will be the scourge of the propaganda machine, is that while banks may provide mortgages to individuals with below average incomes and other potential black marks, this time around, having a job will be necessary. If we are right, and if indeed almost 34-some million people have at best recourse to the occasional temp worker paycheck, this will wreak havoc with the first derivative for the US \"tail wags dog\" economy where housing, and untenable and enslaving housing debt more specifically, is the critical support pillar of the ponzi scheme.<br />", "recommendationCount": 144}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

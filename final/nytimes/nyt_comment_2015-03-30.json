Not everyone does think anonymous donation is wrong; some parents and children prefer it. Countries differ on whether anonymity is required, forbidden or a matter of choice. It sounds as though Israel requires anonymity. I think it's probably better for the child psychologically to be told at an early age and have the option of later meeting the donor as an adult, but that isn't an option in many cases. Luckily, companies like 23andme should make it pretty easy for these kids to learn about their genetics or track down genetic relatives someday. I would guess many will not be interested.  Even in my family, there's a wide variation in interest in family history. I do think the vehemence of some of the responses to Amy Klein have been off putting.

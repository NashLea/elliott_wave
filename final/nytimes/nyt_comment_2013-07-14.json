In effect, we're asking the tests to tell us WHY students know something (or don't), and that's something they can't do.  When there was no threat that schools would be shut down or teachers fired based on test scores, the high school teacher whose kids had elementary skills could focus on remediating those skills.  Now, only the test scores matter, not the learning that they're supposed to represent.<br/><br/>To say nothing of the fact that student test scores depend on a number of factors, and parental factors are much more important than anything that happens in the school.

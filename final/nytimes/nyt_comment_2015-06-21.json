A VAT is imposed on services unless designed not to tax services. A VAT can be imposed by only taxing a business' profits and labor costs. This is called the additive method. Most countries use the credit method and that too can tax services unless excluded law. For example, the last time I looked, in the UK most services, including accounting and legal services are subject to VAT.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, under the original Civil War version of the U.S. income tax, renters were allowed a personal deduction for their rent and interest and state and local taxes were also deductible thereby putting homeowners and renters on the same foot. In the early 1870s that income tax was repealed and subsequent iterations of the income tax did not allow a deduction for rent of housing. Your position that a VAT is therefore superior to an income tax is wrong. As I started out saying, to understand what a given tax does and does not tax, you have to examine all of its provisions. Labels and generalities are not enough. Congress could easily put renters and home owners on the same footing if it wished to so design the tax that way. But, do not count on it happening. Home owners likely vote in much greater numbers and are more vocal than renters. Moreover, making up for the revenue that would be lost by a renter's deduction would prove to be an impossible task in the present political environment.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3431827, "replies": [], "lft": 161, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/health/saving-heart-attack-victims-stat.html", "parentID": 15274740, "commentID": 15281557, "rgt": 162, "userDisplayName": "human being", "createDate": "1434855753", "userID": 36252727, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1434860862", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "USA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1434857262", "commentSequence": 15281557, "commentBody": "You know, Sal, she said she believes God put the team in place.

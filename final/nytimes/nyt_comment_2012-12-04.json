They hold a press conference to announce: \"I'm bringing Hollywood to (fill in the place) and we're creating jobs and.....\"  It makes a nice one minute piece on the local nightly news and everyone is happy. What's a lot harder to comprehend is the financial machinations outlined in this fine piece of reporting which does not fit into tiny sound bites or paragraphs (which, btw, is  what Hollywood and the politicians desire....the general citizenry not understanding the true nature of this). <br/><br/>I have worked in film production for 25 years and we when we come to town we never even spend our per diem that we are given. The big difference between a tax subsidy (and that's what it is) for Hollywood and a company making a permanent move, as that the latter will have employees that buy houses and pay property taxes and become part of the infrastructure of the community. We Hollywood types keep our money and go back to our place of residence and spend it there.

It's literally millions of dollars just for the sets - the building, the decorating alone, before you get to the star salaries or the crew salaries which are good middle class to upper class jobs.  The tax return is double the money spent on the credits.  That has been established by audits which is why the credits have been renewed. The industry draws students into the area colleges to study all aspects of filmmaking and the creative fields tied to it.  Okay it's not brain surgery, but the demand for content is high, it's a low impact industry that feeds into the economy of the city in countless ways.  Without the credits, being that New York is the most expensive city to live or work in, and certainly to film in, it would be difficult to say if filmmaking would be able to continue on the level we have enjoyed since the tax incentives started here.

However, if these cells are immortal, then the cells do not divide (or else the jellyfish would continually grow in size), the DNA does not replicate, and the telemerers.

While humans continue to reproduce, our population grows exponentially, clearly as a result of couples having more than two children. These jellyfish seem to not reproduce sexually, or even reproduce many offspring at all. In addition, jellyfish have predators and strict environmental limitations. Humans, on the other hand have the technology to survive and be protected in any environment.

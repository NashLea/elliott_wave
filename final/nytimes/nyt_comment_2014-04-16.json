One obvious answer it is that for opponents it is an issue of life and death. For pro-choice women, it is a question of personal autonomy and bodily integrity.\"<br/><br/>A few observations...<br/><br/>First, one cannot begin to answer this question without looking at how sex education has been impacted over the last thirty years due to aggressive lobbying by religious and right-wing groups locally to pare curriculum taught in our schools, going from state to state, What young people know about the way their bodies work and how life begins is woefully inadequate, to put it mildly.<br/><br/>Second, what we collectively learn about philosophy and social ethics during the formative years of our lives - those years we spend in school - is woefully inadequate in two important ways: <br/><br/>1. We don't learn how to think critically early enough and in the ways that matter most.<br/><br/>2. We don't learn the things philosophers discovered through the ages early enough and, therefore, don't think deeply about life's existential questions unless we have some need to (can be personal circumstance or taking Philosophy 1 to get rid of a college requirement).<br/><br/>Which leads to our political situation today. The far right is able to make inroads due to a number of factors, including less than adequate public participation at the polls and due to shifts in beliefs that correlate to a targeted decrease in information.<br/><br/>Links below in reply to this comment.", "recommendationCount": 99}, {"assetID": 3399252, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 11576449, "replies": [], "commentID": 11576559, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "lbdiamond", "createDate": "1397622968", "userID": 229276, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1397647445", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Look Ahead", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "san francisco", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1397643845", "commentSequence": 11576559, "commentBody": "Dream on....  \"easy to replace Russian natural gas supplies....\"  at best the timeline for implementing a US pipeline and shipping system with LNG capabilities is years away and winter gets real cold in Europe in spite of the garble of the UN Global Warming sirens......."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 11576449, "replies": [], "commentID": 11576718, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Katharine", "createDate": "1397628348", "userID": 57206958, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1397647776", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Look Ahead", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Massachussetts", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1397644176", "commentSequence": 11576718, "commentBody": "Very well put indeed, especially about those armed masked Russian guys on the news in the Ukraine reinforcing a negative stereotype about Russian thugs."}]}, "lft": 46, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/opinion/mr-putins-power-play.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11576449, "rgt": 51, "userDisplayName": "Look Ahead", "createDate": "1397620807", "userID": 18426496, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1397620868", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "WA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1397617268", "commentSequence": 11576449, "commentBody": "Memorandum<br/>To: Fearless Leader Putin<br/>From: Loyal Oligarch Comrades<br/><br/>We are most concerned about the Ukraine Situation.

He decries the corruption of Government but sees it as the outlier. I see Government corruption as merely a reflection of society's corruption. We have become a nation that worships materialism, consumption, ease, and affluence. Yes, effort and work are admired, but only as a means to those ends.<br/><br/>In all nations, what unites people to share burdens and benefits are great causes or unique cultural identity. Those have been lost in the US as globalization has replaced national identity and outsourcing waging war to 'volunteer' mercenaries and foreign surrogates has eliminated great causes. And multiculturalism(a positive for social harmony) has embittered traditionalist determiners of American ethos who have lost their social primacy.<br/><br/>What remains is a common striving for affluence, always an American aspiration. But technology has extended 'winner take all' economics to almost every aspect of commerce. Affluence will simply no longer be widely distributed.

Though the president was no Michael Jordan, he was a smart player with a decent jump shot. But what impressed me most about the president's game was his willingness to do the dirty stuff--defend and rebound--as well as his tenacity--he didn't back down. I witnessed the president try to block a dunk attempt of a much younger, more athletic player and get knocked flat on his butt! Yet, the president got right back up and kept playing. The president also engaged in some good-natured trash talking, which told me that this guy could take it, as well as dish it out. After the games were over, I left the gym thinking this guy was going to be great for our country--he's a smart, gritty, thick-skinned guy who won't back down from a good fight. Fast forward to 2014. If I'm completely honest, I haven't seen much of THAT guy I played against in 2008. But in the last few weeks, I'm starting to see signs of that guy I was hoping to see in 2008. I'm not saying that Obama's executive order on immigration was the right thing to do or that reestablishing ties with Cuba is in our country\u2019s best interest, but I do like THIS version of the President.

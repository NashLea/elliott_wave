I am a millennial and I found the behavior absolutely disgusting, from spitting (why so much spitting people?), loudly passing gas, yelling insane comments and at really bad times, constantly chanting \"USA\" and acting like frat boys gone wild, regardless of age. A lot of people were wearing hockey and football jerseys, which, with their bellies hanging out, just seemed weird at a golf event.

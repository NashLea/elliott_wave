Still, it's all about St. Sarah. As this pattern continues,  voters are not going to be casting any votes for St. Sarah unless she moves  her blood-libelled body  to Dancing with the Stars.

The central premise of progress through exchange of ideas seems true and powerful; the question I have is that Ridley and other 'cornucopians' seem by habit to visualize human advance as more stuff, when the next set of ideas to spread might be about less stuff. (The artist Tino Sehgal, who a year ago created a beautiful and haunting piece at the Guggenheim purely out of conversation, could be a bellwether in this regard.)<br /><br />Another troubling question, prompted by Sarah Palin's borrowing this line from Madison in her video response to critics today: \"If men and women were angels, we wouldn't need government.\" That's from the Federalist 51, a great piece of political writing and thinking, done with quill pens, without electricity, in a country that, at the time, had a population about the size of present day Brooklyn, and contained Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, John Adams, Abigail Adams, Franklin and Washington. It's unnerving that tech and population size don't correlate one-to-one with the value of intellectual achievements. Computers are oddly powerless at producing users who can write with the insight of Shakespeare, Tolstoy, or even of JD Salinger. Those trend lines, scaled against population growth (wait, why don't we have ten Shakespeares?), seem to be going the wrong way. Jaron Lanier is the tech thinker to look at here. Apparently, culture influences people, and technology may or may not be your friend in that regard.<br /><br />I do think Federalist 51 would look great on Twitter: not only the line Palin used, most of the lines in the fourth paragraph, like: \"what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?\"<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 2289516, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/can-140-characters-matter/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3223287, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Richard Reiss", "createDate": "1294878985", "userID": 28319740, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294896208", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294896208", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "Of course, moments after posting, the best rebuttal to my tech skepticism coincidentally appeared via my friend Inez -- who just created a crowd-sourced benefit concert film:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12151914\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bbc.co.uk...</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2290977, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/so-this-reporter-says-to-this-scientist/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3223298, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Tom Gray", "createDate": "1294879352", "userID": 6709157, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294896221", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Quebec", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294896221", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Overheard in the math department:<br /><br />Climate scientist: Please slow down professor, you've been researching statistics for decades and I've only been at this since lunch.

Forgive me, but, these responses were generally lacking perspective, even while making some great points.  Some of the responses were straight up weird.  For example, one of the experts asks why we aren't genetically engineering crops that can grow in salinized soils in arid regions.  Maybe because we're too busy engineering crops with terminator genes so impoverished subsistence farmers across the globe can't save seed?  Afterall, that's what's profitable.  Engineering crops that actually feed people isn't.  Not that I even agree with genetic modification or engineering in the first place - certainly not the type monsanto and ADM practice.  Another guy suggests that the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will boost grain yields enough to feed 9 billion people by 2050, but doesn't account for changes in weather and temperature caused by that carbon dioxide that will certainly destroy arable land and food.  Bizarre.  These experts seem extremely concerned about global climate change - with good reason, but act as if that's the only threat to our ability to feed 9 billion people by 2050.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a great deal of money has been made by exporting the american diet to emerging economies.  China and India increasingly want more meat and more processed foods (and they aren't the only ones), necessitating ever expanding factory farms growing gm foods - and developing nations just need more food period.  But, if the assumption is that capitalisim continues to bless the world with more wealth and options, and the coprorations behind this growth in wealth continue to export and sell lifestyles that enrich them, then our ever growing populations continue to place more demand on finite resources.  Our currrent state of affairs makes it clear that once they have access to more resources, people overwhelmingly DO NOT chose to step back down to lower levels of consumption.  Somewhere in all this talk of feeding 9 billion people sustainably is a contradiction - I can't quite tease it out right this second, but it's there.  I hate to be the person to say it, but I don't think it's possible to feed 9 billion people.<br /><br />Also, responses make no mentions of the role of fossil fuels in food production, which I find astounding.  Fossil fuels are the sole basis for large scale agriculture - the pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers used by industrial farmers are all manufactured from oil and natural gas.  The equipment needed to farm vast stretches of chemically augmented monocultures are manufactured from and powered by oil.  How is it that it's cheaper to buy garlic from China than it is to grow it in the US?  Oh, right.  CHEAP FOSSIL FUELS.  That's the ONLY reason it's possible to have raspberries from guatemala in our grocery stores in the middle of winter.  Cheap fossil fuels are a key determining factor in our global food system.  The last time the price of oil spiked over $100, food prices went right along for the ride.  Today, oil is at $92.07.  Higher oil prices, when coupled with poor harvests and growing demand, will price the poorer nations out of globally traded commodity foods and people will go hungry.<br /><br />At this point in time, I think the price and availability of oil is THE key component of how we grow food.  One of the experts briefly mentions that Paul Krugman discounts humankind's ability to substitute one resource for another, without specifying what resource could ever replace the convenience, abundance and sheer energy contained in fossil fuels.  (The EROEI on nuclear, solar, wind and hydro does not even approach the EROEI of oil.  Not that we shouldn't pursue alternative energies, we absolutely should - we need to recognize that even with alternative energy, our standard of living will undergo a marked change.)  I certainly hope he wasn't referencing bio-fuels, because if we're growing plants to power cars and not using that land for food, we can exacerbate world hunger very quickly.<br /><br />But, what was most saddening was that none of these experts ever suggested the need to seriously localize food production.  None of these experts expect us to need to eat from where we live.

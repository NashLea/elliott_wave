Yet institutionalized creditors do not bargain with the debtor (you owe $1,000 make 3 payments of $200 and we\u2019ll call it square) but they sell debt at a sharp discount to ruthless debt collectors who actually add to the debt. This is the moral equivalent of settling the dogs on the hapless debtor.  This is not righteousness it is contempt and superiority and a warning to the masses to remind them whose running things and we have Debtor-Creditor and draconian bankruptcy laws to prove it.

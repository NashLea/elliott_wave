The enemies of individual freedom and internationalism may eventually become strong enough to destroy the groups that liberal democracies have put together. If Western Europe does not deliver JOBS then it will instead surrender to fascism or some other intolerant ideology. The appeal of these parties is not because of immigration or even the dysfunctional European Union. These parties are stronger because people are desperate. They need JOBS. If unemployment falls to 6% then these groups will simply vanish. Name a country with less than 6% unemployment where destabilization from the left or right is occurring. There are few if any. Few complains about Romanians when they have a JOB. They just get on with their JOB and complain about taxes. A party that loves the environment, puppies, gay people and foreigners, but does not deliver jobs, is a useless party that will inevitably be defeated. Similarly, a party that loves corporations, and low taxes, and does not deliver jobs is more obviously robbing the people, and will be defeated. When there remains no other choice to this old formula of liberal left and liberal right, people will turn to a party that has not been in power and has \"new\" ideas, even a fascist party.

Ask Israel how easy it is to formulate national policy when burdened with coalitions. <br/><br/>That Modi Mandate may be seen as a result of normal anti-incumbency, but its not - its the Arab Spring in India, with Indians seeking their American Dream aka Indian Dream: that their children live a better life, as in America. But, there is more. There is a youthful exuberance at play in the Modi Mandate.  As Egypt's Morsi learned the hard way - youthful supporters are less forgiving, less patient, and want good results \"now.\"  <br/><br/>The Indian National Congress has a long and rich history of service to India and Indians, starting with Nehru's  famous tryst with destiny at the stroke of the midnight hour on 8/15/47.<br/><br/>PM Modi wishes to emulate that level of service, and given his Modi mandate, he must, and we must all wish him Godspeed.<br/><br/>His opponents must wish him well - its smart, patriotic and graceful. <br/><br/>5/21/14<br/>/s/<br/>Ravi Batra", "recommendationCount": 12}, {"assetID": 3401995, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 11849136, "replies": [], "commentID": 11851552, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "Richard Luettgen", "createDate": "1400682472", "userID": 47123844, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1400687091", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 1, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Bryan Barrett", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New Jersey", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1400683491", "commentSequence": 11851552, "commentBody": "I think it's likely a first reaction here, Bryan, on the politically-correct pretext of \"privacy\".

The ruling specifically states that the link is to be removed; in other words access is restricted and blocked; there is no ruling regarding removal of the content objected to.

But Arthur and Barbara came, and so did Joe and Shirley, and Arthur and Joe got increasingly drunk during the evening. By 9 or 10 pm, Arthur was leaning out the window of my tiny dining room, bellowing into the night something  about Abe Rosenthal, something funny and plaintive and bittersweet about the boss he loved without reservation but who tortured him endlessly.  <br/><br/>Over my years at the Times, Arthur blithely ran interference for me (and for others he had hired) so that we all could do more of what we wanted to do on a paper which otherwise was incredibly rigid and hierarchical.

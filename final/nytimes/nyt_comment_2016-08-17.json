This is a widespread belief that must be debunked.... the one silver lining of these (once?) rare floods is to shed light on this mis-education. To think that folks here in soggy and flat LA, of all places, have this mindset really goes to show you how large of a hurdle this will be to overcome. <br/><br/>I, for one, think that one day of gutting a flooded house is more than enough...not looking to have to repeat this shutting soon.<br/><br/>I am hopeful for a speedy recovery for your loved ones and mine.

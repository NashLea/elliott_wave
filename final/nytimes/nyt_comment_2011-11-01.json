Our agreement also stipulated that Minneapolis was our son's home and if either parent chose to leave the area, s/he was choosing to leave the child which removed the opposing parent out of the equation. Our son is now in his late 20s and we all can meet for holidays and to celebrate his personal successes without the rancor so common to these situations.

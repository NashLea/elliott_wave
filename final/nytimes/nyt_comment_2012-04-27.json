Describing his poetry as terrific is a complement; he loved words and used them, as his lexicon of English usage illustrated as he proudly incorporated ancient Irish language and sagas into his work. He changed throughout his life starting out as a proud Anglo Irishman and gradually evolving to show all the Irish how to live together, proud of their own traditions.

I've spent a significant part of my free time over the last 14 years designing and creating an image-heavy book that you can download and read on-screen or print and read on paper.

Enjoy!<br /><br />Craig has opened some real issues with his smart blog post.  The futurist William Gibson (\"Neuromancer,\" \"Burning Chrome,\" \"Pattern Recognition\") thinks book publishing will become a boutique industry as the online library grows, and many others have argued this point of view as well.  I think the portability and cheap cost of books will keep them around, but new technologies drop fast in price, and ebook readers will become better (lighter weight, longer battery life, higher resolution for easier-to-read, tougher and more durable, color instead of black and white, able to handle a variety of formats) and cheaper pretty quickly.  As powerful, colorful and highly useful devices like the iPad (as its current weaknesses are corrected) are adopted, it will become possible to put some truly spectacular works of both fiction and nonfiction on them.<br /><br />I think that in the end, content really is king, but design is part of the content.  My own background is in programming, writing, anthropology and design.  We all know that most books don't require much in the way of design, as Craig argues:  a column of text with ragged or justified right margins will take care of everything but illustrated works and poetry.  In the case of poetry, add more careful use of line length, but essentially the \"page\" stays the same.  With readers the size of the iPad, and a little bigger, it will be possible to bring to these viewers fully illustrated, illuminated works.<br /><br />See my book, above, if you wonder what I mean.  Are others out there actually engaged in producing works to challenge the current market's thinking?  If so, where are your works, so we can all see what you're up to?

I can tell you, as a kid, you learn very early how to avoid mentioning your parents are listening to Radio Free Europe, that you should never say the name Reagan because that means you know more about America than you should, that any of these could take your whole family away to prisons that are more horrific than the worst around the world. You live with these and learn these things at the same time when you learn you like ice cream.<br /><br /> Don't put Mr. Brin down for that. Respect him for that. If you fail to do that, remember his company is making $20+ billion worldwide and if he wants to he can shape up his company's view because all his stakeholders bought stocks knowing that his and Larry's views come with it and make it the stock that it is. You want normal tech stock, buy Yahoo and MS, see how that works for you.<br /><br />That said, this decision of not censoring their content anymore and leaving it up to China to block or censor it, is the best. The propaganda machine has already turned Google's actions into a west vs east culture war in China, and letting China block services as opposed to Google pulling out is the best business decision. Google will loose the least good faith credit with Chinese users by opening their services and will win ten fold with its western users. Win-win from a business side.<br /><br />Others have said this and I echo it, if China wants to be global player, it should play by global rules. Can't have censorship and then then profit globally  from the same \"western values\" it denounces at home.

She's been very fortunate to have been working in her field since before she even finished school; I haven't been quite as lucky, having graduated right into the recession in 2008. Our mother doesn't charge us rent, but does expect us to do cooking, cleaning and laundry. I know that we're both lucky to have a mother who genuinely is not upset that we moved back in with her. The living situation is more like three adults living together than two daughters living with their mother.<br /><br />What I find a lot of people, especially older people, don't understand, is how difficult it is to live on your own on an entry level salary while paying student loans (not to mention my own sister's expensive medicine for her psoriatic arthritis). Our parents gave us no choice in the matter: we were going to college. The only problem? They couldn't afford to pay for college for either of us. We both received generous financial aid packages from our schools, but still had to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans. And we both worked part time jobs from high school on to college. But it can only go so far, especially when your parents are in no financial situation to help you out.<br /><br />How many of you that expect your children to move out are paying for your children's education yourself? They're very lucky, because graduating with no debt is a luxury very few people my age have.

After graduating at 17, I went almost six years where I didn't spend more than a month at a time living at home. I attended college out-of-state and got summer jobs and internships away from home. After graduation I immediately moved into my own place (well, cohabiting and with a roommate). I was proudly independent and never asked my parents for money (other than paying most of my college tuition). I made it a year and a half that way before underemployment drained my savings and breaking up with my boyfriend meant I couldn't afford my apartment. Now I'm living at home and working part-time until I enter grad school in the fall.<br /><br />I did my best to convince myself that moving home wasn't all bad, that I'd get to catch up with family, that it was temporary. In any case, financially I didn't really have a choice. But having no privacy, little control over things like food, and almost no friends my own age around is undeniably lame. I also find I get along with my mom a LOT better when we aren't living together! So I'm eagerly anticipating going to grad school and having my own place again.

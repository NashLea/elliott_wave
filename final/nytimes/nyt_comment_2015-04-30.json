However the second half needs a lot of work and there were a lot of half-jokes that weren't developed or landing. At times I feel like the writers just spun the \"What makes a good musical\" spinning wheel to develop the jokes, and not in a \"The Producers\" good kind of way. The joke sophistication is somewhere between campy and NYC Jew, constantly winking at the audience to the point of saying \"I get it, I'm in NYC.\"  The show isn't timeless, and the themes are short-sighted, unrelatable, and incomprehensible at times if the show were to ever leave the Tri-state area. The second act is a shallow wreck book-wise, summed up with characters leaving stage in order to develop conflict later in the story, but had no reason to exit stage left pursued by bear in the first place. It is clear that no one really on the writing staff did any research to Shakespeare's time-line since the show opens at some time around 1594-1595 just around the closing of Romeo and Juliet and the written Sonnets, and ends with the performance of Hamlet in 1600 and the settling of what I hope is Jamestown in 1604. Yet, Bottom's wife, who is pregnant some time in 1595 gives birth in 1604, tells me that even the baby didn't want to be part of the production.

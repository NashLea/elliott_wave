The opposite of pay-as-you-go is saving now and spending later.  Social Security was set up to look like as a save now, spend the savings later program when in reality it is a pay-as-you-go system (with a kitty to smooth over fluctuations in revenue) that takes from the young and gives to the old.  My social security premiums went to my folks (who in fact did not need them) and my payments will come from the next generation.<br/><br/>The conservative dream of everyone financing their retirement through their savings is unrealistic.  Everyone does not save.  But  if they did we would still have a problem.  Consumer spending would be less because people would be saving.  The savings would have to be invested, and the return would be low because the supply of investment would be competing for the relatively scarce investment opportunities available.   The return would also be uncertain because bad investments would grow to sop up the available savings, as happened with bundles of home mortgages.  <br/><br/>I suppose it is an economist's dream to be waist deep in investment capital, but at the present time much of this capital is parked with Treasury securities that do not even keep up with inflation.  <br/><br/>If young people are to keep old folks alive, it is much better to do so directly by paying taxes rather than working so owners can make profits that old folks get in their dividend checks.

I've been paying life insurance and automobile insurance my whole life and have never received any tangible benefit from either and that makes perfect sense to me.  One fervently hopes when taking out any insurance that it will not be needed.  <br/><br/>I actually agree with your first statement, that SS should be an insurance program, but that means as with health insurance or life insurance or any other insurance, payment should go only to those who qualify for it and need it.  To pay SS dollars to millionaires who don't need it is ridiculous--why would we do that?  And your comment that \"SS will in any case amount to a small portion of their spending anyway\" is irrelevant.  It's not senior spending we're concerned about, it is money being allocated to people who don't need it and thus potentially depriving those who do need help.

Two suicide bombers are lurking into dark corners. One is headed for Safi hotel and the other for the posh place adjacent to it where high brows stay. Both the human bombers succeed in detonating their devices. As many as 18 persons, mostly foreigners including nine Indians at the last headcount lay dead. Unfortunately there are five Indian Army personnel among those killed and two are still missing. About 35 men including some Indians were injured. Arrangements are being made to evacuate the injured to India for proper medical attention and treatment. Sometime back also there was a bomb blast near the Indian Embassy in Kabul located at a stone throw distance from these two hotels. Fortunately none of the diplomats was killed or injured both the times, albeit the Indian Defence attach\u00e9 and a career diplomat had lost their lives in another terrorist attack prior to that.<br />Every time an attack on Indian life and property takes place, it is the Taliban that takes responsibility for it. Is that Islamist Terrorist outfit alone? Are they so prepared as to mount an attack on the Indian interests in Kabul? No, they are not alone. The Pakistan establishment, especially the Army is backing them. There is a tape recorded conversation that took place between General Pervez Musharraf, then in Beijing on an annual pilgrimage to draw inspiration and military sustenance from the time-tested ally, China. And General Ashfak Pervez Kayani in Pakistan when the latter described the Islamist terror organisation as close supporters of the Pakistan Army who would protect the Army\u2019s flanks when there is a war with India. Various terror organisations in Pakistan are fed, nourished and armed to teeth by the Pakistan Army and the front organisation to do so is the ISI. As a matter of fact, they are all chips of the same block. If any one does hair splitting and differentiates one from the other as a State actor or a non-State actor, he or she is only fooling self and deluding a sworn enemy.<br />AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL AND THEREAFTER<br />President Obama and his administration have made up their mind that an organised withdrawal of the US forces and NATO allies should begin in or around July 2011. The American coming into Afghanistan in 2001 was a great success because both the Al Qaida and the Taliban disappeared from that country. Pakistan had been ruling Afghanistan through the terrorist outfits. In fact the Taliban was born of and brought up by the Pakistan Army. However, in a master stroke of diplomacy, General Musharaff chose to support the Americans to the hilt and, of course, take its pound of flesh. America poured in money, material and munitions of war into Pakistan to have a Muslim country on its side while waging war against Islamist terror outfits. Pakistan was with America outwardly and did capture some terror leaders to please the USA but its real sights were on India as a potential enemy. The aim plus was to govern Afghanistan as and when an opportunity came.<br />The whole world knows that the United States is very powerful in air warfare and its navy is a mighty force ruling waves like Britannia did in the last century. But on land the American GIs are poor fighters. The comfortable life style an American citizen is used to, precludes him from a trench warfare. Be it Korea in early 1950s, Vietnam in 1960s or for that matter the Second World War, the American infantry did not acquit itself well. Infantry is known as the Queen of battle. Here the queen reigns and rules and holds the ground. The American infantry did not win laurels in the close quarter battle. They did not excel in aggressive patrolling or smashing terror outfits in Afghanistan. Even after the great surge when the Obama ordered 30,000 additional troops to be deployed in Afghanistan, the President who iis also the Commander-in-Chief of all US forces was not sure of the outcome.<br />President Obama called his new strategy as SURGE AND QUIT. In any case the American or the European troops are not deployed permanently in Afghanistan. They should achieve the aim of establishing law and order, train the Afghan National Army and the Police and thereafter return home. In a way it can be termed as a sound decision. The snail speed of the elite US Marines in moving towards Marjah, the Taliban stronghold, and capturing it for the sake of flag hoisting by the Afghan Mayor does not inspire confidence among the rank and file of the NATO forces. The Afghan Mayor, a returnee from Germany, is in position but the Taliban sniper fire in Marjah goes on unabated. The Islamist terrorist in Marjah may be down but they are not out.<br />INDIA SIDELINED BY PAKISTAN<br />My heart bleeds for my country. After the Soviet withdrawal, our presence there became untenable.

Its waning hold is likely to put rhythm at risk between two individuals, communities or nations.<br /><br />Numerous instances in record witness to the gory incidents of violence out of the fall of mutual trust. The slightest happening even at a very personal level between two divergent individuals flares up into a cauldron resulting into uneasy calm and communal tension.<br /><br />The recent mass shooting by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan on Nov. 5, 2009 at Fort Hood that cost thirteen valuable lives is a grim reminder of what might happen to the community he belongs to in an atmosphere of congenial mistrust.<br /><br />Though the incident should be termed like any other isolated case caused by a disturbed army officer, and some have argued to the point, yet by and large media as well as the public including the establishment look at it with skepticism and suspicion. The loyalty of entire American Muslim community is under scanner ignoring allegiance of approximately ten thousand Muslim army officers to the nation.<br /><br />Cynical and contemptuous follow-up headlines stigmatizing a particular community for the tragedy hit across the globe and the American media too. \u2018U.S. Knew of Suspect\u2019s Tie to Radical Cleric\u2019, \u2018Complications Grow for Muslims Serving in U.S. Military\u2019, \u2018Army Chief Concerned for Muslim Troops\u2019 were some of them by The New York Times that drew undue attention of public to the ensuing misfortune.<br /><br />The shooting spree in America is not new. Out of distress, unable to cope with emerging pressures in life, individuals in the past have pulled the trigger to fatal outcome.<br /><br />To single out Fort Hood carnage and to correlate it to Islam, as the perpetrator happens to be a Muslim and possibly a regular visitor to mosque, are not only premature but also lacking in the mindset of investigation.<br /><br />Innumerable cases of deviant behavior by the combatants in action back home have worried the experts and have resulted into countless unwarranted incidents.<br /><br />While other incidents caused by identical behavioral disorder were not viewed in terms of one\u2019s faith, Hasan\u2019s has sparked off a debate.<br /><br />Once again Islam is in the centre of discussion. The fact that America is at war with two Muslim nations, Iraq and Afghanistan, more a doing of political fallout, does not imply that Islam is against values America stands for.<br /><br />The link to Islam is fast established for any misfortune that befalls but the other way round is hardly possible. How many of us know about devoted Muslim American soldiers laying their lives for the nation?<br /><br />Holding Islam to ransom habitually is the weakest hypothesis we generate eclipsing in the process the real cause of conflict that may be psychological, social, economic or political.

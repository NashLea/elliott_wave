They began to pick up in employment when the Keynesian ideas were being practiced under FDR in the early 1930s. A cut back in that program led to a slump in 1937. Things picked up again with the spending related to WWII. Relative prosperity continued post war, even as the textile and shoe factories closed down, unable to compete with imports.  The electrical goods factory picked up the slack.

Any change in tax system will be compensated by negotiation of employee and employer under the condition of un-changed ratio of negotiating powers of the sides as well as by lobbying. If anything, any complication favors the stronger (i.e. the richer) side as they will probably adapt more rapidly and precisely, using professional help they can more readily afford.<br/><br/>Therefore I believe the \"fairest\" or rather \"best\" tax system is the cheapest, simplest and least intrusive one. Taxing land and maybe some other real property that already has to be registered by law would probably be the simplest and would not require expensive and constitutionally and morally questionable IRS. Taxing imports and exports falls into the same category but has other consequences if the rates are significant. Flat tax is also one of the simplest and at that the best although many people think it's the most unfair one -- but see above about fairness.<br/><br/>To summarize, the best tax is simple and low.

No amount on money in the hands of consumers can ever generate full employment again, because the things people spend money on simply don't take as much labor as they once did.

Print money.  Well, actually, the Fed, which creates all of our money out of thin air, simply buys government bonds. The important thing is for the money supply to be appropriate to the level of economic activity.  The measure of that balance is inflation.  If there is no inflation, then the Fed is not pumping too much money into the system.   <br/><br/>I think John Maynard Keynes figured this out back during the last Depression, and he was proved right by the build-up to World War II.

It runs in Windows, Mac, and Linux OSes. One particular stroke of genius is that it opens an Across Lite diagramless file without revealing the finished grid. You can work in the grid, or enter clue answers in the Across and Down clue lists and then drag them to the grid. End black squares are placed automatically, and if there's a known symmetry to the puzzle, it can be set to automatically place symmetric black squares. Another masterstroke is that it lets you pick up whole sections of crossed words and move them elsewhere in the grid (try doing that on graph paper). Having searched the Wordplay blog and the XWord Info site, but finding no mention of it, I thought the word needed to be spread in this forum.

If we as consumers only express interest in soccer when the World Cup comes around, the content delivered by the networks will be poor and largely geared towards illiterate viewers.

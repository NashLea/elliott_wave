I don't have the right to \"speak\" for all parents, because my kids are too old. (\"Not really a mother anymore?\" Really Stephanie?) But when I run a substantial number of guest posts, so that the entire spectrum of parenting IS well represented, then I am not doing my job because the posts -- which you feel I am not qualified to write -- are not written solely by me? <br/><br/>Have I missed anything? <br/><br/>As for deleting posts by people I don't like -- I have in fact deleted a large number of your posts, but not because I don't like you. I don't know you. I delete them solely because they are not about the topic at hand. Like this one, they are about me. And, as you said, too much talk about me gets tiring."}]}, "lft": 36, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/what-did-you-do-in-the-hurricane-daddy/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4440979, "rgt": 39, "userDisplayName": "mileena", "createDate": "1314850621", "userID": 49765285, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1314850803", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1314847203", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "Lisa Belkin is not really a mother anymore, therefore she should not be blogging.

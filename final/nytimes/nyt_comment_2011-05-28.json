He was born in December 2004. Had we been at home in the states at the time, he would have been forced to wait the additional year. He is now about to finish 1st grade at the age of six (youngest in his class) and he is thriving. He reads at a near 3rd grade level and is in the top three students in his class in math and English, and he receives exemplary marks in art. Many of his school friends have already turned seven. He doesn't have any issues with the 'older' kids other than the usual issues that children that age experience with each other. <br/><br/>In my son's case, starting Kindergarten a year earlier was a good decision. He was ready. One of things that I worry about when we return home to the states is that the schools will want him to repeat a grade simply due to his age rather than his ability. I think that a child's ability is what should be considered when a child begins school. Whether or not they have been prepared for Kindergarten makes all of the difference, not merely the age of the child. Many children are ready at age four. I don't think my child is an exception to the rule.

Romney then hid much of that fortune in offshore investments, and refuses to release his tax records so that we would have a better idea of where and how he has invested. And to top it all off, Romney is running on a platform of raising taxes on middle class families by $2000 while eliminating their Medicare, all to pay for $4.3 trillion in tax giveaways to billionaires and big corporations. As Jennifer Granholm said \"in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator and the workers get the shaft.\"<br/><br/>On the other side is President Obama, who has provided an average tax cut of $3,600 to middle class Americans and wants the wealthy to start paying their fair share again so that we can reserve programs like Medicare. He has fought to preserve middle class jobs by, among other things, rescuing the auto industry and, thereby, saving one million jobs.

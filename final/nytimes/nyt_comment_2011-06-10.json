Because they haven't paid attention to private debt. On the other hand, they tend to get hysterical about the public debt which is always a much smaller problem.<br/><br/>Ostensibly we need to fear the public debt because it is \"like a household debt, only bigger\". In fact, it is OPPOSITE to a household debt: without federal IOUs (dollars, bonds) the public would have NO net savings! I can have a deposit in the bank, but this is bank's liability. To hold savings in aggregate, the private sector needs to hold IOUs of someone outside it. This someone is the government issuing its IOUs. Private net savings is holding government debt (dollars, bonds). No federal debt, no net savings for the private sector.<br/><br/>Imagine a Monopoly game. The central banker wants to \"be responsible\" and run a surplus - take in more dollars than he emits, thus siphoning off the players' savings. The game will stall, the Monopoly economy will die. This \"plan\" is backed by neoliberal theories that defy basic accounting: supposedly this will make the players \"more confident in the government\" and spend more (Spend what? - they have less money now, go figure. And: when was the last time you thought about federal budget before spending? I just look at my income: the federal IOUs in my wallet, the more the better!).<br/><br/>But if the govt keeps spending, the US will go bankrupt, right? Wrong. The reason is because the US is off the gold standard, it creates every dollar it spends out of thin air (unlike Greece that needs to borrow Euros to spend). Gold could run out and the government could go bankrupt, but now the US creates money as needed with each payment and it destroys (almost) the same amount by taxing. If you are thinking \"what about inflation?!\" - you are right. The only problem can be too much money (inflation), but the government cannot possibly run out of dollars, like a bowling alley cannot run out of points.

Every day I read Republican deceit about our budget and economy. Each Sunday morning I listen to the usual Republican guests respond with the usual obfuscation to moderators on the \"reality reporting shows\" like Meet the Press. Most deny they're doing or have done what they are in fact doing and have done, or claim to be doing what they aren't and haven't done. Cantor? Pawlenty? McConnell? Boehner?  Too many Republicans play the game of deceit, or what parent's call \"lying\" when their kids do it. \"Rentiers?\" You include their avatars, too, right?\r<br/><br/>An example: Pawlenty is correct in this sense about class warfare:  Republicans have been blitzkrieging the middle class for 30 years.<br/>\n1.     Since Ronald Reagan Republicans repeatedly cut taxes, didn't balance our budget when they could, and borrowed and borrowed and borrowed. They amassed most of our national debt. They promised that deficits don't matter. National debt was $994 billion when Reagan entered office. George Walker Bush alone increased it from $5.7 trillion to $10.4 trillion. 91% of the $10.4 trillion debt Obama inherited is from Reagan, Bush I, and Bush II. Barack Obama also inherited wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, a ruined economy, massive banking and financial bailouts, and slashed tax revenues that obligated government to a trillion dollars in additional debt.<br/>\n2.      Republican tax cuts and policy resulted in a transfer and concentration of wealth in the United States not seen since the Great Depression. By fourth quarter end 2010 U.S. household net worth totaled $56.8 trillion, 34% controlled by the top 1% of Americans and 73% controlled by the top 10%.   90% of income earned here is earned by the top tiers of wealthy Americans. Income and wealth disparity are the greatest they've been since 1929. Our poverty rate is at a 50 year high. More Americans than ever rely on government help to feed their families.<br/>\n3.     Middle class income has stagnated since 1973. National \"median income\" is $49,800.00. The bottom 90% of Americans average $31,000 a year in income.<br/>\n4.     Republican policy and governance gave us a collapsed economy and 13,700,000 unemployed Americans. 20% of workers are underemployed. \r<br/><br/>The U.S. fiscal collapse over the decades beginning with Ronald Reagan is about two things only: MONEY and POWER. There's plenty of money in the U. S.. Our current political arguments are just battles over allocation of that money. We may not be able to balance the budget only by \"taxing the wealthy\" as many Republicans wish to cast it, but our taxes are the lowest of western nations and our wealthy citizens and corporations are the least taxed they've been for 50 years. Hundreds of billions of dollars are in corporate coffers. It isn't the middle class that has power in the U.S. We're a Republic, a representative democracy, in which business and their lobbyists are more represented than individual voters.\r<br/><br/>Another example, why is it that we were willing, even in the midst of The Great Depression, to raise marginal tax rates to over 90%, and for 40 years to leave them over 70%, as we waged world and regional wars and built our truly great nation, but we won't raise them now to even 45% to wage war on debt, unemployment, bad education, health for all, and to restore our great nation? It isn't as if the wealthy will suffer. THEY HAVE NEARLY ALL THE MONEY. And THEY HAVE NEARLY ALL THE POWER. It's as if the owners of penthouses in a large condominium, who own roof top swimming pools, decide they don't like the HOA expense for one community pool for the other residents, and demand as members of the board that the HOA replace it with a toddlers wading pool those wealthy declare to be better. That's what Republicans propose for Medicare. It's what they intend for all our societal spending.\r<br/><br/>Once upon a time a scorpion, to cross a stream, got a ride on its promise to a frog to not sting. Half way across it did. When the paralyzed frog protested the scorpion responded that it had to sting, it's a scorpion's nature. If Republicans are allowed to replace Medicare with a program that favors their corporate benefactors then social security, unemployment compensation and disability are next. They'll call the changed institutions swimming pools. But they'll be waders. That's what Republicans do. It's their nature. \r<br/><br/>Lincoln said that, \"You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time.\" The warning is that you can fool people. Republicans count on it. It's their nature. We've become a government of, by, and for the wealthy and powerful, of \"rentiers.\" What Republicans intend is what they promise: to shrink government until it's small enough that they can drown it in a wading pool.  It's their nature.

After all, much of the work would be done by people who would otherwise be unemployed.  Unemployment is a drag on the economy because much of the spare capacity for labor just gets wasted.<br/><br/>He is also correct that homeowners need some relief from the steady stream of foreclosures.  Here Obama had some good ideas which were abandoned, such as allowing bankruptcy court to lower mortgages that are underwater.  This would of course have a negative impact on the banking sector, but it baffles me why banking has so much political clout, why we cannot hold banking responsible for the CDO's and other instruments of financial destruction they created.<br/><br/>Krugman is less convincing when he argues for higher inflation.  The argument that this helps debtors only works only if the debtors can demand higher wages to offset increased costs, something which is not so possible when unemployment is high.  Inflation in commodities is particularly troublesome when it drives up food prices, which people need to survive.  About 44 million Americans are now on food stamps, and inflation together with high unemployment is a toxic mix for many.<br/><br/>And roughly half of the national debt is owned by foreigners who would likely regard any intentional policy to set a higher inflation target as tantamount to a default by the US on its obligations.  The only thing saving the US from higher interest rates is the fact that the major competing currency---the euro---has even greater problems with the potential bankruptcies of Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  And although interest rates are so low now that real yields on 10-year treasuries are close to zero, and negative after taxes, continued deficits of $1.5 trillion per year are not sustainable.<br/><br/>That's why economic stimulus---jobs for the unemployed---should be payed for by higher top rates on the wealthy.  Sadly, on all the important economic  issues---more stimulus, mortgage relief, higher taxes to pay down the deficit---Obama has caved to the Republicans.

Culturally, the GOP continues to be the small party with the Big Story driving the political and policy discussions. The story's purpose also has multiple purposes; the main one being to hide the expansion of GOP command and control revenue and power through the budget process. Under the big tent idea of deficit reduction, the GOP plan to cut taxes for the rich, restrict environmental regulation, shrink rights for women, workers, bind education, and transfer public monies to expand wealth, with medicare being the GOP's starring idea of how to shrink benefits and expand revenues for the wealthy. But on the way to deconstructing a popular program, which, under the GOP, would be called Medicare\u2014after the program formerly known as Medicare--its essence would be different. Keeping the name is merely a charade, as insulting as the clip art proposal they presented as a jobs proposal. Clip art does not create jobs.<br/><br/>In the new qualitative construct, the old assumptions and relations are being reworked. Even the focus on these new relationships is being redirected away from their real intent. If you can borrow at zero interest, why not borrow? If you can create economic expansion through electronic trading globally, why not expand profits? If you can build wealth through markets in currency, commodities, equities, and special instruments, why not? The more interesting question is why not one CEO of the 1,000 largest corporations has been called for an interview and asked about jobs. Only pundits repeating the big story of fear as the shock wave of policy are being interviewed. Yet wealth is hoarded under our noses. In fact, the Times has recently featured a series of op-ed posts featuring sympathetic looks at the problems plaguing global  billionaires! And why has not one CEO  been interviewed in print or broadcast media and asked about their job creation strategy the growth and expansion of their human resources?<br/><br/>The global company, Rio Tinto, just pledged to buy a billion dollars of commodities in the next year from China, and China's state managed economy is building mines and farms in Brazil and Africa. None of this activity is possible without the low interest rate leverage that makes the investment of big sums attractive. BP still has contracts with the Defense Department worth more then 10+ billion dollars annually. The top 100 US government contractors all benefit from not having to increase productivity to keep up with the cost of money. As long as interest rates stay near zero and interest risks are non-existent, why not exploit the mega-markets for capital and abandon workers? No one's asking or holding corporate heads accountable or putting them in the spotlight. <br/><br/>I fear the fate of the American worker, now abandoned by both parties.

You're one of the few influential people who isn't dictated by Rentiers. In a world where the stench of greed and corruption permeate, your column is a whiff of fresh air.<br/><br/>The prevailing mindset among our policymakers is bizarre, to say the least. There appears to be a fixation with inflation, the value of currency and austerity, before even addressing the more immediate problems of unemployment and feeble economic growth. An incomprehensibly mad rush to put the carriage before the horse.<br/><br/>You are correct to point out who are behind this Pain Caucus. It's the big players. The banks, the hedge funds, the insurance companies and other financial institutions which have a huge stake in the stability of the bond and currency markets. <br/><br/>Ironically, these institutions are also the big players in the commodities market. Positions they take have caused huge volatility in those markets. <br/><br/>Hedge funds have been identified as the primary culprits behind the huge swings in oil, metals and agricultural products, oftentimes bringing about artificial shortages or gluts, depending on what positions they take. It wasn't too long ago when Goldman Sachs spooked the world by declaring that $300 per barrel oil was just around the corner.<br/><br/>Sadly, what I gather from this kind of mindset is that human capital is of very little value to those who influence opinion and policy. It has all been reduced to financial terms. Fiscal restraint is more important than human lives and human dignity. Deficit reduction is more important than creating or saving jobs. The value of money takes precedence over humanity.<br/><br/>Thank you, Dr. Krugman, for being a sane voice in a world gone mad.

Geithner has been even more of a deficit hawk than Obama, although Obama's twelve-year austerity program is bad enough for the hopes of a recovery from the current recession. Cutting deficits during a recession is economic madness and is an idea that serves only big finance and financial institutions such as the IMF, which are fixated solely on the goal of protecting their loans and investments, no matter what the damage is to the local economy. Though both Republicans and the WH claim otherwise, budget cutting during a recession tanks the economy, dampens demand, lowers revenues, and increases the deficit. History shows that -- except for countries with a big export surplus, which definitely excludes the US -- during a  recession only an expansion of government spending and the creation of more jobs and demand can entice companies to produce more and increase revenues, thus cutting the deficit.\r<br/><br/>Since more temporary, well targeted government spending is the proven way to reduce unemployment and shrink the deficit, the financial class is actually making things worse for ordinary people and shrinking not the deficit but the middle class as a whole. Special payments to ordinary families, such as those made in Australia, would stimulate the economy more than continued bailouts of and cheap money for big finance, and Australian unemployment levels have been much lower than ours, probably because of this spread-the-wealth policy. But Wall Street and the rest of the investor class in the US do not seem willing to spread the wealth around. They want to keep almost all the money flowing between banks so that they can try to pay down their hidden debts and pretend that they have completely recovered from the meltdown, and they would rather foreclose on homeowners than renegotiate mortgage terms. Meanwhile, manufacturing firms are making profits by increasing productivity while not passing along the gains in the form of wage increases or more jobs. Wages and working conditions deteriorate as the number of unemployed increases.\r<br/><br/>The WH and Dem leadership is not responding to this worsening crisis of unemployment and weak demand. If the president and the Dems in Congress hope to win in 2012, they must stop working for Wall Street and the financial class and propose ways to stimulate the economy, which is falling back into what may well turn into a double-dip recession. The best single way to do this would be to propose a contemporary permanent WPA that would expand during recessions and shrink during good times. A new, permanent WPA would do away with the need for unemployment insurance and related programs, and it would contribute to protecting the recovery and cutting the deficit, so it would be comparatively cheap and fiscally responsible, while protecting the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans.

Remember, she said that in response to something insulting that her daughter had just said to her (she didn't specify what her daughter said, at least not in the WSJ excerpt). IN THAT CONTEXT--and the context is important--I think virtually anyone would understand that \"garbage\" was not a comment on their very \"existence,\" as you put it, but on their behavior at that moment. That's how Ms. Chua herself understood it when her own father said it to her.<br /><br />And I just don't buy your view of the long-term ramifications--teenagers are not such hothouse flowers that responding to an insult with an insult will scar them for life. And certainly not when, through everything else that you do, the kid understands that you love them and want the best for them.<br /><br />Somebody else on this thread chastised Ms. Chua's \"garbage\" remark with a story of their own, saying their son came home with bad grades and they're so glad they didn't call him \"garbage,\" because it turned out the bad grades were due to bullying. People, read the article! She didn't say that in response to bad grades--which I agree would be totally inappropriate--she said it in response to a verbal insult from her daughter.<br /><br />Personally I think it's better for both you and the kids to model real human behavior--such as the fact that when the kid acts obnoxious it makes you angry--than to slowly kill yourself trying to model Ultra-Reasonable-Never-Gets-Mad behavior. We're not highly evolved gurus, we're not the Dalai Lama. We're parents. We're real, normal, well-meaning people with normal human flaws and a few kids in the house. It's far better for kids to learn that people who love each other can make each other mad, flip out (verbally, not physically), and then recover, than to learn that expressing anger is some kind of mortal sin. Exposing children to that truth is hardly child abuse.<br /><br />You also said, \"Doesn't look like Tiger Mother follows the rationale of The Yale Center for the Study of Children psychiatrists.\" Um, okay, I'm sure she's very sorry that she doesn't follow whatever the flavor of the month is in optimal child rearing. If it were 1955 you'd chastise her for not following the rationale of Dr. Spock, but these days half the things Dr. Spock said would probably be considered \"child abuse\" by those who--as Ms. Chua wisely put it--\"assume weakness\" in their children instead of \"assuming strength.\"", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 2300988, "replies": [], "lft": 462, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/the-tiger-mother-speaks/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3240201, "rgt": 463, "userDisplayName": "Daleth", "createDate": "1295131210", "userID": 12790968, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295154402", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295154402", "commentSequence": 217, "commentBody": "Tintin in post #170 wondered about Ms. Chua's sister with Down's Syndrome, wondered (rhetorically) how the \"Tiger Mother\" approach could work with developmentally disabled kids, and concluded, \"Any philosophy of parenting that cannot be applied across all children, regardless of ability or disability, is elitist, flawed, and obsolete.\"<br /><br />In the WSJ article Ms. Chua mentioned that her sister with Down's Syndrome has won two gold medals in the Special Olympics, has a job at Wal-Mart and has a nice boyfriend. So I think that kinda answers your question. Their mother pushed each of her children TO REACH THEIR OWN POTENTIAL, not to reach some predetermined ideal of what all kids were supposed to be. Three of them had the potential to get Ivy League graduate degrees, and one of them had the potential to medal at the Special Olympics, hold a steady job and have a steady relationship... which frankly is a lot more in the way of accomplishment than many coddled slacker kids with normal or high IQs have reached.<br /><br />And I seriously have to question your sweeping generalization that any child-raising philosophy that doesn't work on all children must be wrong.

What is not being mentioned is that Chinese mothers already know this and not only are not mistakenly doing what they think will bring success but know that their children will never be complete. They believe that their is no choice in the decision to demand that no fun is allowed and certainly no childhood. No mother wants a child to be unhappy but with a decision of having some chance at happiness with complete chance of success what do you think any society would chose?<br /><br />Whatever is said about Americans and our obsession in the 'self esteem' movement is 100% correct. Since this has now been proven after 40 years not to have been successful, Chinese mothers have only more ammunition in their clearly harmful teaching methods.<br /><br />So, what is the answer? To be mostly American with a bit of Chinese 'push' or to act mostly like Chua's mother but to be a bit more relaxed? I say allow the children to be children with all our flaws but to utilize better teaching methods that include strong discipline. If that means to self school them then that is one answer.

Few are talking to each other or even having fun. Most are texting or on the cell phone or reading a book by 'Nook' or some DSL game, etc. The removal of these games and units from children and adults causes withdrawal syndrome that creates agitation that resides only after several days. This is worse than drugs or alcohol. All in the name of entertainment.<br /><br />I do not blame electronics. I too have a strong desire to use the computer but strictly for business .

I also understand, first hand, the feeling of loss of never giving birth to a child. But the author is neither the biological nor gestational mother of those children, so what was really driving this?!? As much as the author's tone was supposedly confessional and open throughout the article, I felt that she pulled her punches about adoption. One or two dismissive lines about how they didn't qualify to adopt from China (why?) and then on with her story, as if her only choice was to create children this way. It just doesn't add up. There are countless children in need of parents all over the world, not just in China! Adoption is not for everybody, but I found it cowardly that she was not more forthcoming as to why they did not choose adoption.

Well, ok, that sounds extreme.  But the idea was, as with my parents, that our kids would work to do their best, but would still be loved unconditionally.  Their success did not determine how much we loved them.  One today is a violinist at a college music conservatory.  She began playing at age 4 because of her own interest after watching a boy and his dad play their violins on Mr. Rogers TV show.  When she got older, she wanted to quit.  I would put her off each year until she got into a performing arts h.s. and found her own motivation to continue.  She was the best violinist in her orchestra for 3 of the 4 years in high school.  She learned using the \"Suzuki\" method from age 4 until her teen years.  Shinichi Suzuki wrote a book about his method translated into English:  \"Nurtured by Love\".  It's a lot of work for the parent, but is not a punitive system and is intended for everyone:  \"You are never too old or too young to twinkle.\" (as in play the beginning rhythms using the melody of \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\")<br />Our other daughter stopped playing her musical instruments after high school (she was principal db. bassist in her h.s. orchestra).  She is a determined young grad student that has traveled the world and is planning to \"make a difference while making a living.\"<br />Both daughters are avid readers, have a love of sports, outdoors, animals, cooking, their boyfriends and lots of other friends and family members.<br />We could not be happier with our daughters and I would hope that all parents can give that to their children.  But I work in an elementary school so I know that is a dream.  Our students have rules, they have consequences for not following the rules and of course, rewards when they make good choices,  A reward they appreciate is a smile and/or a hug.  Like our daughters, our students know I and other adults work very hard to provide the best including keeping them safe and expecting the best from them.  I tell my students everyday that they can be anything they want, but it will take a lot of hard work and good choices each day.  They should quiet and responsible in the media center and run around a lot and be loud on the playground.  A lot of what we give our students, they are missing at home, including enforced rules and unconditional love.<br />It seems to me what is missing in the \"Chinese\" way of parenting is balance.  I had a Korean work study student many years ago at an arts college.  She went to school 6 days a week growing up, told me she was constantly sick and most certainly did not have a life long love of learning.<br />Isn't what makes us great as a nation is that we are not like the punitive parent model?  We have children that are expected to make good behavior choices and do not always get their way, but they are respected as people with ideas and desires.  Raising children is a process, not to produce some trophy-like human product, but to see a young person emerge into the world a confident, creative, happy, brave and bold good citizen.  That describes a lot of Americans, maybe more than any other nationality and that is why the rest of the world flocks to us.  We are inclusive while striving to be the best we can be individually and as a nation.  To only be satisfied with being the best all the time is automatically exclusive.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2300155, "replies": [], "lft": 120, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/raising-happy-imperfect-children/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3240408, "rgt": 121, "userDisplayName": "mscheng", "createDate": "1295141509", "userID": 56934182, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295154649", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Beijing", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295154649", "commentSequence": 59, "commentBody": "I'm concerned that the way the WSJ portrayed Chua was distorted to begin with, and that now even the readers of the article are misquoting it.

As well, I agree that Joe Biden is the best representative the White House has in completing complex deals with Congress, a fact that argues strongly for a Biden presidency in 2017.<br/><br/>A key item that has been left out of this debate is growing income inequality. The top 1% and other top earners are doing great, while the middle class and the poor are falling behind.

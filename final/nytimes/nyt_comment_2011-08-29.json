And they *do* pay federal income tax, but not much - for the simple reason that they don't make any money.<br/><br/>I suggest you go to the IRS web site and download the statistics on income tax since 1986 (and go to the tax foundation to get the numbers back to 1980).  In 2007 - *before* the crash, which resulted in millions of layoffs - the Adjusted Gross Income required to put you in the top 50% was $34,000.  That's right, 50% of the individuals and households in this, \"the richest country in the world\", reported incomes of less than $34,000.  The top 25% earn 2/3 of the national income.  The top 50% earn *7/8* of the country's income.  The bottom 50% earned 12+% of the nation's income, the top 1% earned *22%* - over 2$ trillion of the $8.4 trillion total.<br/><br/>Comparing the percentages of 2007 with those of 1980 - the year Ronald Reagan was elected - we see that the transfer from the lower 95% to the top 5% amounts (as of 2007) to 1/6 of the national income every year, and it's still growing.  In 2007, that amounted to $1.45 trillion - over $10,000 *per tax return* in the lower 95.  The bottom 50% has lost 1/3 of their share, the 50-75% bracket has lost 1/4 of their share; the middle class is steadily being impoverished.<br/><br/>The rich are already paying most of the taxes, because they have all the income.

Not surprisingly, private investment went to where the investing was better.  <br/><br/>We now have a new opportunity.  Lithium technology is just one field that we can choose to pursue -- if it isn't already too late -- but to do that will require a reversal of our defeatist economic ideology.

It's not.

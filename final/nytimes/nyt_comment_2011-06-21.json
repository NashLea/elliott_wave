Women need to also be first of choice for those trillion dollar bailouts instead of the predominent majority men who received the funding! It isn't fair and we are not going to take it anymore! We cannot allow a bunch of old schooled men make decisions for 1.5 million women and reject the Supreme Court decision because it is biased and unjust! It is not a sound decision based on the Proper Human Excelences which dictates that you remove all barriers in those women's lives that obstruct them from reaching their highest potential in life.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2873617, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://projects.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/06/20/a-death-blow-to-class-action/leaving-it-to-the-workplace", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4026232, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "What next", "createDate": "1308622873", "userID": 47157696, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1308630784", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Kansas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1308627184", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "I know that I am not on topic, but my dispute with the Walmart is simple.  They targeted every small town and took down their Main Street.  They destroyed everything that was decent and quaint about small towns.  All the businesses that were there are now just old junk stores.  Nothing like taking rural America and bending it to it's knees.  Small towns are not a nice picture today.  People in small towns may be grateful to work for minimum wage with no benefits at their local Walmart.  What else can they do?  The people that used to have a place no longer do.

It took a very long time for men to realize that women should and could vote, wear dresses above their ankles, write books, write holy literature, re-write laws, and be leaders in their own right! I feel an overall lack of Ethics education is lacking in most males in government with any degree high or lower.  Try Dr. Hale for an ethics class and require all justices to undergo his classes.  I really do not accept laws made by a Supreme Court where men are not ethical enough to service the nation fairly. You all understand that most of Walt-Mart employees cannot afford the high price of hourly attorneys indivually. We all understand this whether subconsciously or consciously.  By the way I don't shop at Walt-Mart. I think I understand my reasons now; not knowing prior.  Men should be fighting here to change themselves instead of pointing the finger overseas where they abuse and oppress women instead.

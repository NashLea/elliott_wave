I can see such a policy for employees in the hard news division, those who report on the news, because they are still trying to maintain some semblance of journalistic reporting (Fox News, on the other hand, blurred that line a long time ago, there is no distinguishing between agenda based hosts and their reporting). But Olberman is like any number of others, Rachel Maddow, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, etc, there is no attempt at being fair and balanced there, nor does there need to be, because they are not claiming to be reporting the news, any more then the editorial page of any paper is reporting news.<br /><br />Plus I wonder if the same thing applies to the corporations who own the stations that broadcast the news. Does Time Warner, owner of CNN, not give contributions or contribute to outside groups? Does Comcast (new owner of NBC) or Viacom (CBS) refrain from giving corporate donations? Do the executives there? The corporate suits who own the news divisions are running mega corporation, and they routinely do all kinds of activity to support candidates, how is that any different then Keith Olberman? If this had been Brian Williams or Dianne Sawyer or whomever is anchoring these days or reporters in the news division, I can see it, because it creates the impression of bias in news....and if corporate can give millions to outside groups and to the RNC or DNC, why can't personalities like that who don't pretend to be objective?<br /><br />Actually, I find the whole 'balanced' thing ridiculous, in Europe most news programs (other then the BBC) and newspapers have a stated bias, political parties generally have newspapers associated with them and people know that X paper is the organ of the Christian Democrats, Y is the socialists, Z is the labor party, and so forth, and  maybe it would be better to just be like Fox News and throw the whole 'unbiased' thing in the shredder. The NY Post is known for being hard right, the Daily News is kind of working class conservative, while the Times is known for being more tailored to the more upper class liberal. The Wall St Journal, while its reporters actually are pretty unbiased (they rip everyone apart, Murdoch hasn't been able yet to turn them into the cheering section for the well off and the Chinese that the editorial page now is) is for the most part the organ of big business.

He is not a journalist despite his admiration of Murrow. It is self evident by the tone and content of his show that it is a pundit show not an objective (hah now there's a concept) journalism show. He isn't a news anchor. This is just absurd. If he broke the policy, there needs to be some response I agree. But the hypocrisy of Scarborough doing the same thing and it being excused is just so glaring. Even if the policy didn't exist then, why not address it now vis-a-vis Olbermann?

And, in spite of the fact that I firmly believe an employer should not have any control whatsoever over an employee's personal campaign contributions, it's still a term of employment at MSNBC.<br />I don't work at MSNBC, but Mr. Olbermann does and it appears that he is being reprimanded accordingly.<br /><br />(Nonetheless, if I were Keith, I'd like to see that the same scrutiny were also given to my fellow employees.

The owners of all the major news outlets and most of the minor ones are all arch-conservative corporations: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp owner of Fox, GE the weapons maker owner of NBC, Viacom the mega-media conglomerate owner of CBS, Disney the mega-entertainment conglomerate owner of ABC, and Time Warner the multimedia conglomerate owner of CNN.  Those organizations being accused of a liberal mindset would be like the KKK being accused of being a fair and open-minded organization for civil rights.  Its not in their DNA because of who they are and who they really represent.  The media is owned by corporations that focus on one thing only -- the dollar.  Standing in their way is anything that could be considered more sacrosanct like say human beings, human dignity, human rights, or human compassion.  Those things typically resist a price tag and therefore tend to demand their existence regardless of cost while corporations place a price tag on everything.  To that end, it's almost tragically funny that MSNBC didn't realize the irony that exposes their true colors when they have a policy that states that their restriction on contributions to candidates is based on the notion that this action \"may create the appearance of a potential conflict of interest\".  Perhaps if Mr. Olberman have contributed to Christine O'Donell, Sharon Angle, Carl Paladino or some tea party candidate maybe, but to liberal Democrats?  That's beyond absurd!  But what else could you expect from, a station that allows Joe Scarborough and his sycophant, Mika Brezinski, to genuflect before pantload Gov.

Health care here is abysmal unless you have money to bribe the doctors.<br/>My theory is that when freedom came all of a sudden, there was no institutional or cultural knowledge (\"capacity\") about how to organize a government based on a free-market economy, with all the regulatory, legislative and judicial infrastructure that are required. Instead, it was everyone for themselves, and this has led to deep-seated corruption and, I suspect, an inadequate tax base for supporting schools and healthcare.

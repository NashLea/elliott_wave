Typical physician payment for an office visit of $50-$100 is less than most people pay to have an auto mechanic lift up the hood of a car. Yet these efforts have done nothing to control overall health care costs or health insurance premiums, which are driven by relentlessly rising costs for hospital care, medical devices, durable equipment, and prescription drugs. Not to mention the massive overhead the system pays for administrative costs.<br/><br/>The major effect of price controls on physician services has been to drive more private physician practices into the arms of health systems and hospitals, which operate in a more expensive, more bureaucratic, and less efficient manner. A minority of successful primary care physicians have been able to opt out of Medicare and insurance altogether, delivering more attentive, personalized care to a smaller number of patients, further reducing public access to primary care.<br/><br/>In my own experience, hospital and health system executives are far more profit- and volume-driven than physicians. Reformers are engaging in magical thinking if they believe that \u201cbundled payments\u201d and other trendy schemes which simply shift more power and control to health care executives are going to lead to better or less expensive medical care.

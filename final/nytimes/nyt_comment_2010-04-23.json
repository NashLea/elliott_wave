I thought the whole point of the B2 was to be \"stealth\" - isn't no detection better than rapid deployment?<br /><br />2)  Why rely on one enormous \"smart\" bomb when you can use dozens of cruise missiles launched from subs and ships?  And won't this have less collateral damage?<br /><br />3)  Is a really really really smart big bomb, not just a big bomb, going to deter an Iran or N Korea more than now?<br /><br />4)  Wouldn't such a tremendously powerful \"conventional\" bomb, with the potential for catastrophic damage like a Hiroshima, give the President second thoughts of using it against an Iran or N Korea?<br /><br />5)  It seems the effectiveness of \"smart\" conventional weapons is that we can have US forces on the ground calling in the bombs, within a mile or two and still be out of harm's way.  You lose that effectiveness and ground intelligence when your men have to be 10 miles away to avoid a massive nuclear-like strike.<br /><br />5)  If we're hit by another 9-11, who are we going to bomb with this bomb?  Because chances are another 9-11 would come from a non-state actor.  We can't just put a pin on the map and say \"there!\"  The reason we didn't kill Bin Laden isn't because we didn't have the right kind of bomb; we just didn't know where he was.<br /><br />6)  Does a bigger bomb make a bigger deterrent against terrorists?  It seems our best deterrent since 9/11 has been better intelligence and intelligence sharing, and boots on the ground in places like Afghanistan.  I'm not sure those huge Daisy Cutter bombs in Afghanistan really made the difference, it was the guys on the ground with the Northern Alliance who called in the airstrikes that seem to have made the biggest difference.<br /><br />So excuse my armchair quarterbacking, but it seems obvious that weapons manufacturers are looking for a new product to develop, some politicians are salivating at the prospect of bringing \"jobs\" to their districts, and Republicans are looking for anyway to say a Democratic president isn't protecting America.<br /><br />Gen.

These are really bad guys, and you really do want to see their comeuppance. Entertaining and I highly recommend.<br /><br />And thank you to the filmmakers for resisting the \"Big Studio\" desire to tone down the violence and language and possibly eliminate the Hit Girl character altogether.

I'm sorry I personally feel this is one of the worst films directed by the Cohen bros. The film drags it wasn't very funny and the story was mediocre at best. After being wowed by \"No Country For Old Men\" which I thought was terrific I was expecting a lot more out of this. I did enjoy George Wyner's character however and shows that he is quite a funny actor eveybody rememeber Col. Sanders from \"Spaceballs\". \"A Serious Man\" to me is A Serious Dissapointment and am shocked because the Cohen Bros are better than this.

Anderson who has directed such gems like \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Magnolia\" goes a different route with \"There Will Be Blood\" and scores. This should have won the oscar for best picture, even though I loved \"No Country For Old Men\" I felt this was a much more powerful and important film which shows us how greed can take over oneself for the worst. Daniel Day-Lewis is the best actor of this generation and deserved to win the oscar.The haunting realism he brings to the film makes this a gritty masterpiece that gives an insight look at how corrupt the oil companies can be.Paul Dano was great in a dual role playing Pastor Eli Sunday and his twin brother Paul. 5 stars goes to Paul T. Anderson's epic film, if you haven't seen it please watch it today. ", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

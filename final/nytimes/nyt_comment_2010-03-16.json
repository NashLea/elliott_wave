As a middle school teacher, I know for example that the National Middle School Association has summed up what research tells us about successful middle schools in a wonderful and concise book, \"This We Believe.\" Unfortunately, one of the other principal lessons we can learn from comparing schools is the strong detrimental effect of poverty and malnutrition on students, acting on children's brains even before birth. Any plan to improve schooling for all our children will need not only to look at teaching methods as well as school culture and structures, but also to include a resumption of the war on poverty.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1244676, "replies": [], "lft": 946, "assetURL": "http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/israels-challenge-to-the-u-s/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1702820, "rgt": 947, "userDisplayName": "student", "createDate": "1268713851", "userID": 36203713, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268714539", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268710939", "commentSequence": 425, "commentBody": "Israel is America true and only friend in the Middle East.

I mean a tremendously-overstated as had former American presidential candidate Sen. John McCain: \"Today we all Georgians?\" Some good that did.<br /><br />This lack of forethought...launching attacks on a super-power capable of totally annihilating any hint of their existence, begs to question might Israel's insecurity regarding their longstanding co-dependency on American military supremacy have played some part in their upstaging not solely Vice. President Joe Biden, but that of Secretary Hillary Clinton and President Obama' two-state peace-agreement initiative?<br /><br />The timing could not have been worse...and damn inappropriate, for Israel to mysteriously announce new settlement construction within a region disputed by the Palestinians. And of course Israel is far greater a military power...nuclear-armed as such, than Georgia could even hope to aspire.<br /><br />But this international incident which caused great embarrassed at American expense, on the Israelis' part...during on-going negotiations merely to lay the foundation for a possible two-state peace agreement, might have only provided<br />Hammas more propaganda-material for recruitment and a means to stoke further anti-Israel sentiment within an already teetering-on-the-brink Middle East.<br /><br />In my view Israel uses America as a defense-firewall against a military incursion against their country...regardless of the Israelis lack of good-faith efforts during any such peace negotiations.<br /><br />Perhaps Israel felt this section of land was not up for negotiations in their dispute with the Palestinians? Regardless, might they have exercised restraint until at the least the peace process had had begun in earnest? I love Israel. I want it protected from any such attack...aerial or ground offensive.<br /><br />But, as if I were arguing \"defense-of-others\" for a client...let say Israel in advance of a pending out-right military assault on Iran or Hammas, I would like to go before the UN Security Council as the American Ambassador with the full-knowledge that my client-Israel, exhibited a level of diplomacy that illustrated they at least \"gave a damn\" about subsequent American blood and treasure that<br />might be brought-to-bear.<br /><br />Or act unwisely... at the behest of a leader who opted to act unilaterally, and \"go-it-alone\" with only a shadowless-guarantee that American military might would be there in the advent of an overwhelming military-incursion of Israel.<br /><br />America is no friend of Hammas, however our nation have sought a peaceful...constructive, relationship with the Palestinian people' in hopes of short-circuiting just such a confrontation with a collective of Hammas, Iran, and other Middle Eastern nations for that matter. Peace is a knife that cuts both ways.<br /><br />This slight toward the U.S. peace envoy will serve only to encourage Hammas and radical extremist globally, while as well causing an angered America to reassess its position as sole arbiter between these to equally proud...fanaticizing, nations.<br /><br />As an American I'll fight for the sovereignty of an Israeli state, but I also respect the Palestinians right to manifest destiny...or a self-identified homeland. The era of George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice is over. America...hopefully, will not resort to seeking a peace-meal agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on-the-one-hand, while shipping \"Bunkerbuster\" bombs via Australia to bombard the Palestinians on the other.<br /><br />True and sustained peace must be not just a future hope, but a present-day reality.

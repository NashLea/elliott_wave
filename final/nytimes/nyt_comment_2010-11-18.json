We aren't too picky either really. Sometimes we stay in $50 a night places, sometimes $1000. I have never written a bad review of a hotel of all the places we have gone until now. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place. First of all, we booked the executive suite like 3 months in advance. There is only 1 room like this. When we went to check in they directed us to our room. Once we got inside I knew immediatley this was not the room I booked. We headed back to the front desk and told them we booked the executive suite. The man at the front desk proceeded to tell me that the room was occupied and that the room he put us in was just as good (which it was not at all). First of all, he should of told us the room we booked was not available...not just try to send us to another room and hope we don't notice. He claimed the people in the room we booked extended their stay and refused to check out of that room. If you are the hotel manager it is your job to tell them they need to move to another room if someone booked it in advance. Why should that be my problem. We booked this room 3 months in advance. I spent probably an hour researching hotels on trip advisor and picked that room because it had a terrace with a view. I looked at many hotels and decided on this one based on the reviews...big mistake! Here is where it gets really bad...we had pre-paid online. After much arguing with the man he told us he would give us a refund, but claimed the credit card machine was down and they had no cash. He told us to write down our information and he would refund the card when the machine was back up. To this day we are battling with the credit card company and have filed a charge back. I am shocked by the good reviews, I can only guess they are writing them themselves. After seeing the rooms, this place is 1) way overpriced 2) these people don't know the first thing about customer service and 3) a bunch of dishonest crooks!!! Don't bother making a reservation here as it doesn't mean anything. And there are way better hotels in Istanbul. These place was seriously nothing special at all. If I could give it zero stars I would..one star is way too generous!! Worst hotel experience I have ever had!!!<br /> They were keen to have me use the hotel shuttle (a mini van) on my way to the airport, although it may have cost slightly more than a taxi (though that would be subject to unpredictable traffic). No doubt they need to keep the driver occupied for those times when a group needs the bus. The hotel's rooftop restaurant is very pricey, but the view makes it worth while to eat there at least once.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2087685, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/opinion/18kristof.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2856848, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Phil in the mountains of Kyushu", "createDate": "1290047031", "userID": 58220231, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290068056", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Japan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1290068056", "commentSequence": 12, "commentBody": "Try telling this to \"educated\" people.<br /><br />Take, for example, all those getting \"educated\" in private colleges and universities.

But he was addressing the United Nations about other countries' poverty - not ours. He was trying to convince the \"other rich nations\" of the world that we should do more to combat need and despair in places like Africa. He was trying to pretend we are still the richest country on earth and a great savior. Judging from Obama's recent diplomatic failure in Asia, the rest of the world isn't buying into the Land of Plenty myth any more. Somebody must have told these foreign governments that one in seven Americans lives in poverty, that the unofficial jobless rate is close to 20 percent and that we rank far below the rest of the civilized world in education and quality of life.<br /><br />So, it should seem clear to us all that when President Obama and his plutocratic cohorts in the Oligarchic Republic of America talk about extending the Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans, that this government no longer belongs to We, the People. Despite a few tweaks in the health care industry to allow a few more people to buy private insurance, the ranks of the sick and the uninsured grow daily. People with pre-existing conditions cannot afford to buy the products of companies who are gaming the system and increasing rates. Obama is inclined to let banks continue foreclosing homes rather than helping people stay in them.<br /><br />When Haiti was suffering after the earthquake,thousands of Americans made donations to the American Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and other charitable agencies. It won't be long before we, too, will need the charitable assistance of outside agencies if this corrupt way of governing continues. We have got to find a way to take back our democracy before that becomes a necessity. We must and we will continue making a noise that our government will ignore at its peril.", "recommendationCount": 297}, {"assetID": 2087685, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/opinion/18kristof.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2856915, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Marie Burns", "createDate": "1290048468", "userID": 4461145, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290068056", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1290068056", "commentSequence": 19, "commentBody": "Your statistics may be news to many Americans, but the leaders in Washington have known where we were heading for a long time. We can only conclude they like it that way. Both Republicans and Democrats, from the President on down, act as employees of the rich moneyed oligarchs who fund their campaigns. Some Democrats truly oppose current policies, but too many -- including the President -- cave to or actually encourage laws that continue and exacerbate the concentration of wealth in the privileged few. They refer to the rich as \"savvy businessmen\" or pretend they are \"jobs creators\" or assert the rich have \"earned\" their astronomical incomes.<br /><br />Now come the \"intellectuals\" with farcical plans to \"solve\" economic problems like our huge deficit. And what do they propose? To cut benefits for seniors (Bowles-Simpson). To make veterans pay for part of the care they receive for their war wounds (Bowles-Simpson). To eliminate the interest deduction (Bowles-Simpson). To lower the tax rate for the rich (Domenici-Rivlin). To eliminate the estate tax for huge estates (Every Republican). To reduce capital gains taxes (Every Republican). To impose a regressive sales tax on consumer goods (Domenici-Rivlin AND, get this, Paul Krugman!).<br /><br />Finally, to show just what small-minded cheapskates these \"intellectuals\" are, they propose to -- for the first time ever -- make visitors to Washington, D.C. museums pay for admission to see the nation's treasures (Bowles-Simpson).<br /><br />It is true that among these sweeping proposals are a few elements that seem to benefit the average American. For instance, Domenici &amp; Rivlin suggest a one-year Social Security payroll deduction holiday for both business &amp; workers, which they say will add a significant number of jobs. This may be true, but who will pay for the shortfall in the Social Security coffers? Why, the poor &amp; middle class who will eventually make it up either through taxes or reduced benefits (or both). This, as I see it, is simply another way to link the separate Social Security fund to general revenues, revenues that increasing come from average American taxpayers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the showmen &amp; -women in Washington are making a mountain out of what isn't even a molehill -- earmarks. Whoop-tee-doo. Earmarks represent something like one-half-of-one-percent of the federal budget &amp; eliminating them will probably create no cost savings at all because they are funds that are already in the budget. Eliminating earmarks just transfers the decision on what projects will be funded from the Congress to the Executive, a transfer that is Constitutionally questionable inasmuch as the Congress is supposed to control the purse-strings.<br /><br />So, yes, our apologies to Central &amp; South American countries. We must quit calling ourselves a banana republic. Let's just call ourselves what we have become -- a high-tech feudal society in which there are only serfs, warriors (because we are always at wars!) and a tiny clique of lords.<br /><br />The Constant Weader at <a href=\"http://www.RealityChex.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RealityChex.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 504}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

As someone who has major recurrent depression, the connection seems self-evident (as in, why didn't I think of that before?), but his analysis simplistic.<br /><br />For me, insomnia sometimes comes with the depression, sometimes not.  But sleep doesn't help the insomnia, the fatigue, or the depression.  I am always more depressed in the morning after a long night's sleep.  I do not really feel \"awake\" until night-time.  It's as if some part of my sleeping brain won't let go; it's only after many hours (and sometimes, counter-intuitively, after a short nap), that I begin to feel the cobwebs drifting away.   (When I am very depressed, this feeling never goes away, for days at a time.)  So maybe there is something in my brain that gets activated by sleep that causes or exacerbates my depression.  I have noticed on the number of occasions where I have had to go with little or no sleep that my mood, and even more my motivation, is demonstrably better, both in the morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />For me, in many ways, depression itself is like nothing so much as an intense mental and spiritual exhaustion--all I want to do is sleep (and when it's bad enough, I want to sleep forever--not die, just sleep forever).   When I am very depressed I am very tired all the time--whether I sleep for 18 hours straight (which I have been known to do) or I can't fall asleep until the sun comes up.<br /><br />At the same time, I think the connection between depression and sleep is too complicated to prescribe sleeplessness (and I don't think that's what the article was recommending).  Going without sleep can lead to exhaustion--which can lead to depression--which is then going to be cured by sleeplessness?

Having dealt with my depression most of my life I know more than  most doctors or therapists.  I was so happy to find this article on the front page of the Times today.  I told my therapist I would print out something regarding sleep deprivation for her. She should be doing this not me.  I have been well aware of this for years so why are scientists just discovering this.  I didnt sleep much the other night and had a wonderful Easter as a result.  I rarely get relief from my debilitating depression so this was amazing to me.  I know it is directily related to the sleep deprivation.  However you can only do this once in a while because your body does need sleep.  Like so many other depressed people I speak to they function best at night and mornings are torture.  Something is definetly messed up with the sleep cycle that is bringing on the depression.  I am happy that scientists have discovered this and it may lead to better cures for depression. However it is probablly too late for me.  I am 43 years old and have lived a great deal of my life in pure hell due to my medication resistant depression.  If it wasnt for money,  sleep deprivation  would have already been recognized and there would be a cure.   I just hope they can come up with someting that will benefit me before I die.  My therapists solution is for me not to complain to friends and to use my therapy time to complain.  I cant believe she has been practicing for 20 years.  How can I not complain when I feel absolutely horrible and cannot concentrate and am tired all the time and am barely making it through the month financially.  Does she have any clue?  Why can everyone else bitch and complain about everything but I have to watch everything I say and do.  Its wonderful advice not to complain but is impossible in my situation.

(Admittedly, I've been spoiled by the simple network setup of my iMac and 2Wire DSL modem/router.)  I usually can see several WiFi networks most everywhere I go, but unfortunately they are all invariably password protected and therefore inaccessible.  But just think of the possibilities and ease of Internet use one could have if somehow one could get access to them just by being within range of their signal -- no 3G congestion problems/dropouts or costly data contracts!  People might even cancel their cellphone contracts and instead use VOIP and SIP software on their smartphones to make and receive calls.<br /><br />Under this Golden Rule paradigm, one would grant limited free public access to one's WiFi network in return for getting limited free public access to all other private WiFi networks of those making the same grant of public access.  The router would have a second firewall to shield the private local network from any public guest.  Available bandwidth to the Internet for a guest user would be limited to either the bandwidth unused by the hosts on the network or ~10% of the total available, whichever is greater.  This limit would ensure that guests on the local network would have little impact on the hosts' Internet response times.  However, because most WiFi networks probably sit idle over 90% of the time, Golden Rule guests would usually have full access to the available bandwidth.<br /><br />Logging in would be transparent once a personal WiFi device identifies a Golden Rule network.  Access would be user ID and password protected with access controlled via a central Internet server, akin to a Domain Name Server.  While there may be other issues that need to be addressed to maintain network security and access, these undoubtedly could be overcome.  The rewards of virtually universal free WiFi would definitely be worth it.<br /><br />So, David, if you have any connections with the powers that be at Cisco/Linksys and other network equipment vendors, please lobby for this Golden Rule WiFi initiative.  Your adoring public would be forever in your debt.  You beat back the \"beep\" at cellphone carrier voicemail systems.  Perhaps now you can enable us to do unto others as we would have them do unto us -- and become a later-day patron saint of free, universal WiFi access.<br />", "recommendationCount": 15}, {"assetID": 1342349, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/technology/personaltech/08pogue.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1819138, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Ron Bannon", "createDate": "1270693127", "userID": 1921925, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270699674", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Newark, NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270696074", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Why not just get an Apple wireless router?", "recommendationCount": 21}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

In addition they increase the required amount of savings required to fund a certain retirement income lower rates tend to increase desire savings for a lot of people.  Just check annuity rates &amp; you will see that a lot more savings are required to achieve a given fixed annuity payment than 10+ years ago.  It does not appears that these factors are in the economic models, which assume that lower rates increase both investment and consumption.  These factors reduce the effective stimulus that results from lower rates, and do not seem to be appreciated by most economists.

Yes, Meade failed to press his advantage after Gettysburg, and Hooker, Burnside et al got their acts wrong. Neither these, nor McClellan's cold feet at Antietam were acts of treason. Actually, the adjective 'treasonous' was used by me in referring to M's reprehensible defiance of order to give aid to Pope in the 2nd Bull Run battle (reference to which had to be deleted from my original to stay within word limit). Lincoln told Hay of his suspicion: ''M  wanted Pope defeated''. 'Stanton wanted the man court-martialled. Chase said he should be shot. ('Tried by War', pp.120-121).

But he himself had serious limitations of character.<br/>He was a vain man with a 'messiah complex'. He enjoyed being called the 'Young Napoleon' and relished his promotion as the general-in-chief (1861), which he gained by conspiring against Winfield Scott. His esteem for himself and lack of it for others showed in his letters to his wife, in which he called Scott an \"imbecile\" and the President: \"the original gorilla, about as intelligent as ever.\" In his generalship, he was limited by an almost pathological fear of being outnumbered by the enemy, which led him always to justify inaction in battle by reporting inflated enemy strength. To his soldiers he posed as a 'populist' general, who wanted to avoid 'unnecessary' bloodshed. He was also a crypto-sympathiser of the slave-holders' rights and thought his job done if he could just defend the Union territories without going for the kill against Lee's Army. He squandered a great opportunity by not chasing the fleeing Southern army after Antietam. His only saving grace was as an organiser and battle trainer, which made Lincoln retain him after that 'treasonous' inaction for some more time. All in all, destiny served America well by not making him President.

We can wax philosophical until we fall down exhausted, but at the end of the day the big difference in attitude seems to come down to utility.

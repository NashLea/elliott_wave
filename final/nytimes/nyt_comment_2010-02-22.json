How many of those who are critical face the same ugliness but for the grace of...?  Our family faced it down and we are treading water, for now.<br /><br />We suffered nine months of unemployment.  My husband changed careers to the healthcare field in his 50s; he is earning less than he would get on unemployment. He got a job mostly because he looks young and markets himself relentlessly. We have multiple \"plan B's\"  just in case.  It is easy to imagine that my income will eventually tank, as employers decide to replace me with a younger worker.  This should be illegal, but it's incredibly easy, thanks to decades of regulatory neglect in employment law.<br /><br />Another problem that we face is the fact that our home, once a reasonable part of our debt environment, is sucking our resources:  we can't save, credit use is rising, and we can't move because we are underwater. The mortgage (Bank of America) refused to help us. (We tried. \"Nightmare\" is the best term I can use to describe the effort.)<br /><br />It's a horrible trap. These workers' credit becomes impaired, fueling an downward spiral engine.  Credit reports now determine job prospects because employers are allowed to \"check\" them.  That should be illegal as well.<br /><br />We need more ability to change and influence our reports: We need the right to \"cleanse\" our credit reports when we have to make decisions to survive. There is nothing wrong with our character, nor is it a true measure of risk; about one third of this nation should walk away purely as a business decision. We didn't create the problem, but we are prohibited from fixing it.<br /><br />The woman in this story didn't necessarily make worse lifestyle choices than most of us, so let us not be sure that we might done better.  Diabetes and weight management is most often a factor of age, not choice, despite what one reads. The same things that younger people are doing now produces much worse effects, or catch up to a person. Our food is not as wholesome as it should be. I will suggest that one should not assume arrogantly that one will avoid the problems of age because an active lifestyle should produce better results -- often it doesn't work that way.  Also, as income declines, the quality of food calories tanks.  In fact, some experts believe that low-cost beans are highly acidic foods that, in large quantities, helps contribute to diabetes, osteoporosis and bone loss. There is a reason the poor suffer more obesity. You wouldn't make better choices, Mr. Highlight, I'll lay odds.<br /><br />This is a scary time for boomers.  Expect them to be active in their concern, at least.  This is not a generation that accepts decline graciously, most especially when they themselves did not make the mess. I warn Congress: Address the issues of the transfer of wealth from their pocketbooks, or expect consequences.<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather not have a French Revolution in the US.  It was ugly and was followed by a dictatorship.

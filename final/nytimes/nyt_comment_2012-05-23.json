New productions can (and should) be judged on their merits, and whether they complement or distract from the music and story.<br/><br/>In addition, few of the new Met productions (e.g., Traviata) have truly been original in terms of ideas.  I personally found that production cliched and gimmicky.   <br/><br/>I completely disagree that the Traviata production was in any way faithful to Verdi.

The Israeli government immediately offered to return the territory in exchange for peace. Jordan refused to take back the West Bank in exchange for peace (although Jordan and Israel ultimately signed a peace treaty in 1994).

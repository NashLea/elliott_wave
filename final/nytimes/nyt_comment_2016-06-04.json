On June 7, 2008, a few days after the primaries ended, Hillary conceded to Barack Obama because he had around 100 more delegates than she did. She gave a generous concession speech and urged her supporters to start supporting Barack. Then she started campaigning for him. At the convention in August 2008, Hillary was the one who nominated Barack for President.  (Google 2008 Democratic primaries\" and you'll find a good Wikipedia article on this.)<br/>Bernie Sanders currently says that even if Hillary Clinton is still ahead of him in popular vote and pledged delegates at the end of the primaries, he is going to contest her nomination at the convention in late July and try to persuade superdelegates to overrule voters' preference for Hillary. For Bernie to do that would be, in my opinion, futile and divisive, and would suck energy and resources away from the all-important goal of defeating Donald Trump in November.  I hope Bernie will change his mind and, if he is still behind Hillary in popular votes and pledged delegates when the primaries are finished, concede graciously to Hillary and throw his support behind her, as she did for Barack in 2008.

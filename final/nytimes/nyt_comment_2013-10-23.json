Affordable healthcare is simple not amenable to the normal constraints of the free market system. It simply isn't. The experiment has run for more than 50 years. In Canada, everyone has health insurance; Canadians live longer than Americans; their infant mortality rate is lower; when polled more Canadians approve of their healthcare system than Americans; and the bottom line is that they pay 40% less per person for their healthcare. If the U.S had the Canadian system, as a country we would save about $800 billion dollars a year. Our annual deficit this year is $600 billion; so we could do everything we are doing right now, balance the budget, and put $200 billion dollars in our pockets. No one can claim that they are interested in saving money; no one can claim that they really care about the deficit, if they are opposed to single payer system.

Some interesting proposals.  I'll agree with some.  I'm a retired federal employee who started working in 1972 for the SCS.  Before I really understood the differences between D's and R's.

From my perspective I've seen some similar patterns.  I liked Jimmy Carter before he gave us a 9% raise in his re-election year and was astonished a president would court the fed employee vote. I worked through Reagan-Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama.  Reagan surely embarrassed us with his 9 worst words but since we worked with the ag community and helped farmers and ranchers they weren't really hostile.  Bush I didn't have much affect.  Clinton cut our budget to the point it seemed we needed high authority to get a pencil.  <br/><br/>Bush II lavished our agency with new computers, trucks, other equipment and gave farmers and ranchers all kinds of monetary incentives to participate in conservation programs.  We didn't get the extra staff to properly plan in the field to design the plans.  It was a get it spent attitude.  People worked faster with less good field work.  Even GWB got a conservation plan for his ranch in Crawford from SCS, now NRCS.

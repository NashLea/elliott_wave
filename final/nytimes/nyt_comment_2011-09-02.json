GSEs were not mislead by mortgage lenders period.  GSEs were operating without the expertise for many years, cutting deals with lenders and got caught with their proverbial pants down.  I know personally of a case wherein a non-depository mortgage lender extending non-recourse mortgage loans and the GSEs agreed to bundle this separate beasts with the conventional mortgage A paper on the strength of handshakes.  Unfortunately the GSEs executives cutting these deals are no longer employed by the GSEs and have left the employ of the these GSEs with a truckload of taxpayers monies as bonuses and golden parachutes.  If the government want to recoup its losses it must first reach back to the GSEs executive who stood to gain during these stinky deals and perform a forensic accounting to trace how the monies for this deals were distributed.  GSEs were playing it fast and loose for a long time and after they tanked and let the malfeasors resign or separate from the agencies are looking to blame some external entity.  GSEs employs individuals who are capable of conducting independent research on every deal securitized and do not have to rely on the representations made by those banks.  Blaming the banks now is ridiculous especially since the American taxpayers have already bailed the banks out.  If the banks are now the perpetrators, why not allow them to fail and permit the transfer of mortgages from the banks to the GSEs to rehabilitate.

It is glaringly aparent to me that it is remarkably dumb to foreclose on a homeowner when they can afford a slightly smaller monthly bill LIKE RENT instead of being kicked out of the home. This would satisfy both the stubborn banks which refuse to renegotiate a mortgage and the resident who needs a place to live. The banks should organize a division to administer rental agreements to those who defaulted so they can provide income to the bank for a home that would otherwise be a vacant loss, and perhaps, that would allow the resident to get back on their feet and reapply for a new mortgage while providing the original mortgage lender a majority income on the home. After all, a vacant home is an absolute loss on the books and an invitation for vandalism and devaluing singly, and as part of the whole housing value decline problem. Is accounting an issue? Are the banks making more money by kicking residents out and getting tax breaks? Change the tax laws for the banks, so there is incentive to keep the residents in the homes.

It ends with the statement that in 2010, 10 banks own 77% of all US Bank assets. They now are all considered to be \"too big to fail.\"  Based on the documentary's actual evidence from the book,  facts which have never been denied, there is only one solution.  Nationalize the banks.  Because of what is known to be  the financial and economic situation today in America, with the banks not using the money they received to help the economy but to hoard it for themselves, the fear expressed in the movie about nationalizing the banks to keep the US economy from collapse, is no longer valid.  It is now the only solution.  Nationalize the banks.  It is the only salvation of the American economic system, because of its evident failure due to lack of regulation and greed.   Since the taxpayers of America will always be the backup to  failed banks under what is an obviously failed system, the taxpayers must own them.  I am convinced that it will happen, because of the facts in \"Too Big to Fail\", seeing all that had to be done to save banks and investment banks in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Banking investors are not what will save the banking system and the US economy.  Only strong government action and ultimate nationalization will do that.

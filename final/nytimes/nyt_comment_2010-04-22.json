There is no data to support this; as a matter of fact, armed persons did not prevent Fort Hood. There are no reliable stats on stolen guns being used in crimes; nor are the reliable stats on innocent lives saved versus taken by well-meaning gun carriers.\"<br /><br />Item 1. There are data to support the proposition that mass murders can be stopped by armed victims. Bear in mind that when a mass murder occurs, it ends when one of three things happen 1) The shooter runs out of ammo (rare); 2) The shooter kills himself after he runs out of victims or gets tired (common); 3) Runs afoul of another person with a gun (occasional; a consummation devoutly to be wished). Only number 3 has the possibility of ameliorating damage. Notice that in \"gun-free\" zones (AKA \"victim disarmament\" zones), number 3 happens late, if ever. That is why mass murders happen in these zones -- they end only when the maniac decides to stop.<br /><br />In contrast, there have been several well known abortions of aspiring mass murders, to wit Pearl High School, Appalachia State Law School, the Utah church, Tolley Square Shopping Center, wherein armed individuals brought a quick halt to the slaughter. In none of these cases was there any \"collateral damage\". Admittedly, the number of defenses is low but they are spectacularly successful. The experience with \"gun-free zones\" is uniformly dismal -- once a mass murderer starts doing business in one of those, he gets to finish pretty much as he will.<br /><br />Item 2. Fort Hood was a victim disarmament zone -- THE SOLDIERS WERE NOT ARMED!  This is excellent evidence for MY point. Only police were armed, and the murderer had his will with a room full of victims until condition 3 above happened -- the arrival with the persons with the guns. Had the victims been armed, as they SHOULD have been and as they were trained to be, the murderer would have been felled within seconds.<br /><br />Item 3. Stolen guns being used in crime. Not sure why this is important. Guns used in crimes come from many sources, the most prominent pool being the criminal community. Most crime guns are either bought off the street from illegal sources (39.2%) or through family members or friends (39.6%), from Firearm use by Offenders, Bureau of Justice Statistics, November 2001.<br /><br />Item 4. \"reliable stats on innocent lives saved versus taken by well-meaning gun carriers.\" I tend to agree. But we do know that there is no massacre of innocent lives by well-meaning owners. From Gunfacts: 11% of police shootings kill an innocent person - about 2% of shootings by citizens<br />kill an innocent person, from Shall issue: the new wave of concealed handgun permit laws, Clayton Cramer, David Kopel, Independence Institute Issue Paper.

Bush, expire for the richest Americans despite concerns that raising taxes could hurt the tenuous economic recovery. \u201cFor us to extend them would mean hundreds of billions of dollars of lost revenue at a time when everybody says we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re dealing with our deficit,\u201d he said.\u201d<br /><br /> The amount of money lost over the last decade alone due to these cuts<br /> is astronomical.  No more cuts for those that have profited on perpetration.<br /><br />\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.He acknowledged that the deficit has grown far more than he had expected until late in his presidential campaign and he seemed to leave the door open to new or increased taxes that would affect the middle class, despite his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $250,000 a year.\u201d<br /><br />NO. NO.  A promise is a promise.  No more burden on those who are already reeling. Tax the banks and their evil sisters, who brought the country to its knees proportionate to the suffering they have caused.  Without consequences like that, they will simply retire<br />to the back room to plan their next predatory assault.<br /><br />\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Noting that his stimulus package last year gave temporary tax breaks to all but the wealthiest taxpayers, he reaffirmed his desire to avoid more taxes on the middle class. But he did not flatly rule them out, saying he would not prejudge the recommendations of a new commission he has appointed to develop ways to reduce the deficit.\u201d<br /><br />RULE THEM OUT! The President should not back pedal on these commitments.<br />Recommendations of the new \u2018commission\u2019 do not rule out favoritism to those whose constituents are still lobbying for tax breaks for the rich.  I think the President should take a stand and stick to it.  If not, he loses the trust he has.  A lot of people have stood by<br />to support him with health care reform.  If he does not hold fast on his promises, his supporters will lose faith.<br /><br />\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cI believe that we should be able to make sure that we don\u2019t burden middle class families further,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving said that, I\u2019m also going to wait for the fiscal commission to provide me what their best recommendations are.\u201d<br /><br />The President should make up his mind and take a stand. NO passing of the buck. He\u2019s the one that made the promise, not the fiscal commission.  If he didn\u2019t mean it, then he should admit it. The people that elected him invested in his presidency.  We want a warranty on our votes.<br /><br />No more double speak.  This would be the sort of betrayal that has created such alienation and broken the faith of the American people.<br />", "recommendationCount": 2}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

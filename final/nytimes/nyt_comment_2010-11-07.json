Was it written in crayon and did Dubya remember to stay in lines?  Was it longer than My Pet Goat?<br /><br />Sorry but there's nothing particularly endearing about reliving  eight long years of Dubya.  The botched up election of 2000 ended up with 5 Supreme Court justices appointed by Republicans Corporate Shill Reagan and Bush 41 surrendering  to keys to the White House the one person  they considered the rightful heir  to the throne, Bush the Younger.  After all, it was the only rational decision after 8 years of  William Jefferson Clinton who was still  regarded as an uncouth peasant who hijacked the White House from its rightful aristocratic owners.<br /><br />Personally I'm not remotely interested in Dubya's attempt at revisionist history where he re-invents himself as the noble and decisive hero who saved America from a fate worse than death.  But I do find it a bit odd that Maureen's book report omits the key defining event of the whole Bush presidency--the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

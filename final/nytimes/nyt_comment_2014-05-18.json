What's his?  That's really the only question that matters.  <br/><br/>Foreign policy requires dealing with nefarious players.  It's important to size them up accurately .  Putin has always been an adversary and, yes, quite dangerous to somebody.  I found the reset button to be a combination of foolishness and hubris.  Being the new \"un-Bush\" was a political message that played well domestically.   What benefit accrued to the US in the Putin-Obama dynamic from it?  It was a waste of a gesture, a throw-away.  What were they thinking?<br/><br/>Speaking of wasteful gestures.  What was the purpose of Secretary Kerry running off like a crusader in a red cape to solve the Palestinian-Israeli problem without having done any legwork?  It was more like Kerry's pet project, his need for a legacy, than a sound diplomatic strategy.  Did anyone actually believe he would succeed? Embarking on negotiations that are destined to fail is what novices do.<br/><br/>Foreign policy is about arm-twisting, forming temporary/expedient coalitions and a lot of back channel dealings.

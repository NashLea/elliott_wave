College degrees have become a requirement for jobs that realistically could be done without one.

We have largely dismantled vocational programs here in America, we do not have strong apprenticeship programs (see Germany) and do not pay living wages for a large portion of the jobs that are available without college degrees. We need to strengthen the options for those that do not go to college, invest more in education at the K-12 level and provide living wages and a bigger social safety net.<br/><br/>We as a country have also decided to inflict millions with the yoke of debt for simply trying to better their lives and gain educations.

This was when people had a little insurance to bury themselves, but not enough to replace a lifetime of income. Also, home values were much lower (as were incomes). Anyway, to help keep them in their home, the local bank who still held the mortgage (which was customary back in the day) allowed the widow (with two children) to make only interest payments for a few years (not reducing the principle), until such time as she was able to obtain full-time employment and get back on financial track. I don't think that would ever happen today.<br/><br/>Admittedly, local banks also had the power to make mischief. I'm sure they were responsible for aiding institutionalized segregation by disallowing mortgages for certain people in certain neighborhoods. We definitely wanted that practice to go down the drain. However, it's unfortunate we're now in the position of having thrown the empathetic community-building baby out with the bath water.<br/><br/>I think strengthening community banks, definitely while correcting their faults, would have made us better neighbors.

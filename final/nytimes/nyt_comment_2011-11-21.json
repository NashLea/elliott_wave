This is exactly the same kind of behavior on the part of our government for which we condemned the Soviet Union from Stalin through  Brezhnev, for which we criticized Mao and the Cultural Revolution in China, for which we held Apartheid era South Africa a nation outside of the brotherhood of nations.<br/>\n2. About some things, Orwell was right, albeit 17 years late in becoming a reality. The truism of '1984' was the imposition of a permanent state of war and its concomitant state of fear. Franklin was right when he said that \" Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither liberty nor security.\" That is the position we are now in, neither free nor secure, despite the longest period of 'war' in the history of our nation.<br/>\n3. Some posters blindly buy in to the conceit that these men were captured on the battlefield. In many cases this is manifestly false. In some cases, especially of the Chinese Uighurs, the US had paid 'allied' fighters a bounty to produce 'enemy combatants' and they did so with no other motive than greed.<br/>\n4. This is a matter of war, and it could never impact our own constitutional rights here at home. Think again. Secret Courts and secret findings? A secret opinion authorizing the assassination of an American citizen abroad? It's only a thin slip before it becomes an authorization to assassinate dissenters here in our own country. Paranoid? Maybe so, but no more so than those who so blindly embrace the 'security state.'<br/>\n5.

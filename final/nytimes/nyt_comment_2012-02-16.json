(The College Board officially no longer considers it an aptitude test). Many students who earn A grades in AP-level English classes still lack some very basic comprehension and composition skills -- it doesn't mean they're not capable of acquiring those skills, just that their grades don't tell the whole story. <br/><br/>The SAT and the ACT are the only measures that colleges can use to directly compare applicants: assuming that someone has in fact taken his or her own test, it can't be inflated, fudged, or pumped up with extra credit, no matter how much money someone has spent on prep. Of course scores directly correlate with family income. Admissions officers know this and view applications accordingly, at least when it comes to poor (minority) applicants who clearly have potential. <br/><br/>To the people who complain that these tests don't reflect creativity or social acumen or any other of a dozen warm and fuzzy measures, consider that American schools are unique in considering warm and fuzzy measures at all.

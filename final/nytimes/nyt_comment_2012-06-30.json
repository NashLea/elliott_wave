Not only have we been stuck in a rat-hole of a stadium (literally), but our team has been impotent on offense and inept on defense. Pontius understates the problems of giving up leads - we gave up tying (or losing) goals in the final minutes of multiple games over the last few years. It's been a real trial.<br/><br/>But this year's team is a revelation. Led by DeRo (getting old but still hanging in), Pontius, Santos, etc., we're getting some really pleasant play up front. And the defense has been solid enough. (After the Olympic qualifying debacle, Bill Hamid has started to regain the form that made him one of our few bright spots over the last few years.) Can we keep it up? I dunno, but I'm pretty happy right now.<br/><br/>One major sticking point is the future stadium for the team. Progress always seems to be right around the corner, but we're still mucking around in RFK. Now, I love it when the stands bounce, but we haven't been able to draw good crowds the last few years. Good core crowds (who make the stands bounce), but not the casual fans. Could be a result of the quality of play, but now that we're getting more attention, we'll see whether we can get a good crowd as a first place team this weekend.<br/><br/>As for Pontius, the man is opportunistic and really makes a difference when he's out there for DCU.

In addition, their climate response of SO2 is very conservative; more detailed calculations of climate responses of sulfate, such as those in the Streets et al. article and others suggest a stronger impact than used in that study, so even lower SO2 emissions in Wigley would give a similar conclusion with more detailed climate response calculations. Finally, it is not only SOx from coal that causes cooling but also NOx and \"cooling\" PM. In theory, if all coal emissions were removed, as they should be, coal would warm more. However, that's not occurring today or any time soon in the U.S., China, or anywhere else. The bottom line is that both coal and gas are bad for society and cause mortality and global warming. Coal kills more but so does natural gas. Gas warms more, but so does coal. The danger of gas is that it will bring about a faster tipping point in the Arctic, Both coal and gas need to be eliminated immediately to address global warming, air pollution mortality, and energy and economic stability.

If I'm not mistaken, your argument is not about the toxic effects of carbon dioxide on humans, which it does have at higher concentrations.

If you ventured out into it, and asked about this subject, you might be surprised. This reminds of Pauline Kael's famous bafflement over how Nixon won in '72. After all, she said, everybody she knew voted for McGovern.<br/><br/>This \"oversight\" would have almost zero point zero resonance out there because even amongst hockey fans, almost none of them could name a single women's hockey player or coach. Contrast that with innumerable other sports, even team sports like basketball or soccer. Even I, not a soccer fan, could name a couple of current/former women soccer players (Chastain, Hamm). But even as a big hockey fan, I haven't the faintest clue as to women's hockey. And almost nobody else does, either. If you want to change that, try marketing the sport, not rigging the HOF.

This leaves out economic development and climate change. Granted two huge issues. So for me to get on board with the pro fracking side the industry or someone out there in internet-land needs to convince me that fracking in shallow shale will not impact ground water or at a minimum, convince me there is a remedy upon impact. And the cost is not borne on the State or Federal government.<br/><br/>So let's assumed all my concerns with groundwater impact have been laid to rest, I'll need to be convinced that it is a feasible energy alternative.

However, there should be a set aside or financial trust for research, development and commercialization of truly safe alternative energy sources (what ever they may be).

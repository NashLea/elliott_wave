Investing in something that pays more than 4% is, as this articles says, a critical necessity.  However, markets are far more volatile than they used to be.  Large chunks of net with can be wiped out in less than a week - I have been there.<br/><br/>The key, as a few others have said, used to be stable, well protected pensions, but \"pension\" is a word that will soon only be found only in history books.  Even the best of companies have ditched pensions as too risky for them to manage and hold in trust for their employees.  <br/><br/>The huge downturn is still with a vast majority of us, but the topic is fading fast in retirement articles everywhere.  The harsh uncomfortable elephant in the room is, 401Ks just aren't the godsend we were all told they would be.  To grow a real retirement portfolio is to pretty much ensure that you must stay involved in the market.  Yet, events since 2000 have shown that unlike previous wisdom that said long term market investment would produce prosperity, for many the opposite is true.<br/><br/>The true nature of the 21st century modern market over the long term MUST factor into articles like this more often, otherwise, they are dealing in fantasy, not reality.", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 3373360, "replies": [], "lft": 1065, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/your-money/why-many-retirees-could-outlive-a-1-million-nest-egg.html", "parentID": 9190848, "commentID": 9194670, "rgt": 1066, "userDisplayName": "EBB", "createDate": "1370814944", "userID": 51104031, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1370837112", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Florida", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1370833512", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Richard,  I know several people who are older than 90 and they are not living miserable lives.

It's not that much work--more planning than work. And time spent relaxing and enjoyting one's own home(while cooking), , able to freely wander about and garden in the yard or peacefully clean the house  is not time that I wuld normally be earning money, anyways.  So the idea that this displaces labor-earning is incorrect. It's leisure and homemaking. <br/><br/>My general point is that those those who are concerned about future living expenses and lifestyle would do well to downshift their spending  and learn to enjoy doing the simple things in life well.

What person with a solid understanding of physics or engineering would purport to compare the \"energy density\" of physical fuels like coal and oil with nuclear power, let alone wind or solar rays? These things are apples and oranges in so many ways that simply enumerating the ways would exhaust my allotted share of characters for this post.<br /><br />From a public-policy perspective, comparing energy sources depends almost entirely on four variables: cost, risk, carbon footprint and intermittency.  The latter two are mostly self-evident, so the first two are crucial.<br /><br />Despite having a strong interest in energy policy for over a decade, I have yet to see, in any mainstream publication, a plausible---let alone convincing---cost comparison among coal, nuclear, solar and wind power.  The reason, in my view, is that everyone fudges the numbers to get the results they want.<br /><br />That's not hard to do.  A dominant (if not the biggest) factor in total per-kilowatt-hour cost, is plant cost, amortized over lifetime energy production, i.e., the expected useful life of the power plant expressed in total kilowatt-hours produced.<br /><br />This number is manipulable for several reasons.  The only plants that have sufficient numbers and longevity for accurate estimation are coal plants, which have provided half or more of our electric power for most of the last century.  Nuclear plants have insufficient history because we have built no new ones in thirty years, and all the current designs are new.  Wind farms, let alone solar arrays, are far too new to have developed enough of a track record for an accurate estimate of construction costs, let alone actual operating longevity or maintenance costs (which are no doubt still climbing down a very steep learning curve).<br /><br />As a result, comparing the cost of various energy sources requires calculating \u201cconstructive\u201d costs, i.e., costs based on what little we know now.  In other words, comparison requires a whole lot of assumption, speculation and estimation, which anyone with half a brain can tilt whichever way he chooses.<br /><br />What the public needs to make intelligent choices is accurate numbers, not liberal-arts speculation about dimly understood physics or biology.  It would be helpful if this blogger would spend some time on the telephone and Internet tracking down those numbers, or at least a few unbiased people who have spent some serious time trying honestly to calculate them.<br /><br />At very least, it would be helpful to post varying credible estimates of per-kilowatt hour total costs for coal, nuclear, wind and solar from various sources, giving both high and low values and a measure of variance, such as standard deviation.  I think most readers would be surprised to find how little we actually know about these costs, and how subject to self-interested manipulation the figures are.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 1787603, "replies": [], "lft": 116, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/a-challenge-to-bill-gates-on-energy-research/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2454791, "rgt": 117, "userDisplayName": "Michael May", "createDate": "1282878101", "userID": 35502097, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282883334", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282879734", "commentSequence": 56, "commentBody": "Andy, thank you for asking the \"Why not nuclear?\" question.  Every environmentalist needs that question put to them if they're to be taken seriously on global warming.<br /><br />The red-headed step-children of \"green\" energy are nuclear and WTE.  They have to play a role to solve this problem.<br /><br />The solution to intermittency is twofold.  First you need reliable baseload from nuclear to power the energy needs that cannot be off-cycled, second you need a smart grid that can pair demand with availability.  The ways to do that are on-availability use and on-availability storage.  Charging auto batteries and perhaps institutional or house batteries (for UPS) when energy prices indicate excess availability, but not as much or none if there is shortage makes sense.  Pricing can and should be the way that these cues are sent to energy users.<br /><br />The notion of using plugged in EVs and PHEVs to feed back to the grid seems a bit silly, though it's been repeatedly advanced.  Every charge and discharge cycle loses energy as waste heat, and ideally those EV batteries would remain fully charged for on-demand driving.<br /><br />If we're going to go the route of storing energy on a massive basis to provide energy on demand, then we'll need to build grid-scale battery banks all around the country for that purpose to gain the most efficiency.  Though I'm concerned that will be an inefficient way to deal with intermittency.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1789138, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/a-newspaper-apologizes-to-leader-of-climate-panel/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2454807, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Renegade98", "createDate": "1282878475", "userID": 52496099, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282883343", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282879743", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Okay, now they must make some sort of financial restitution package for the damage they have done to this man.

Other staff members, managers and the maids were just as equally helpful, friendly and courteous.<br /> the rooms clean, the service nice and fast (there was something broken in our room, but the repairing service worked prompty and that's awesome) cleaning is very good, breakfast is fantastic not to mention the views... The list could be endless. There's even a small \"fitness room\" downstairs, which is not advertised as it is kind of a corner, but in mood for some sweating, that will do. I didn't personally tested the sauna and massage service they offer<br />As for Istanbul, it is a fantastic city with so much to see that we are coming back next year ?nsallah. As well as the Old Town, make sure you go up Galata Tower (although they charge 10 lira per person the views are worth every penny) and go to the town of Eyup (a very important place for Muslims) and when you are buying Turkish delight or the gorgeous Baklava make sure you haggle (you'll get a lot of money off the initial price).<br />Tesje Gur  Eidirrim..(thanks so much). (don't know if I write it right)<br />We would definately go back to this hotel again and again and again!!!<br /><a href=\"http://www.hotelambassador.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.hotelambassador.com</a><br />see you next years Bunyamin or Ben (front desk clerk) Nuriye ,Kiraz,( housekeep?ng)Cem (driver)", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1789212, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 2454985, "replies": [], "commentID": 2455009, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Andy Revkin", "createDate": "1282883750", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282883750", "userTitle": "Dot Earth blogger", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "David", "userURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com", "userLocation": "", "depth": 1, "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1282880150", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "The scientists in this field have done a huge amount of work over the last three decades to help lay out scenarios and areas of concern, as here:<br /><a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/warming-embers-burning-brighter/\" target=\"_blank\">http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com...</a>"}]}, "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/on-harvard-misconduct-climate-research-and-trust/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2454985, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "David", "createDate": "1282883212", "userID": 60897213, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282883750", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Australia", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282880150", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": " \u201cthe \u201cdanger\u201d level is for society to judge, not science\u201d.<br />I agree that it is not for scientists to be the arbiter of a single danger level of climate change.

Where I live child protective services feels a lot of pressure from the local media.  On occasions where children in, or previously visited by, protective services die the media makes the department out to be villans.  As the pressure to be more vigilant grows so does the case worker's load.  People are quitting because the stress is too high but there is a hiring freeze so no new case workers are being hired.  This leaves the remaining case workers with an even heavier load and more stress.  Under these circumstances the social workers can not have adequate time to asses all home situations thoroughly.  I don't know this for sure but it seems to me that the heavy case loads these workers are carrying must increase the number of children they are pulling out of their homes.  It you don't have time to properly asses a situation it is better to pull a child out of the home than have your department face the wrath of the local media.  Or that's how the department leaders feel I'm sure.  Maybe if our social services had better funding and our social workers had more time to asses the home living situation fewer children would be taken away from their parents.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://themommyist.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://themommyist.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 1787364, "replies": [], "lft": 70, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/parenting-under-scrutiny/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2454919, "rgt": 71, "userDisplayName": "Mama Ellen", "createDate": "1282881739", "userID": 55905458, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282883777", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Westchester New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282880177", "commentSequence": 35, "commentBody": "Very interesting. I was a foster care worker in the state of Virginia some years ago and believe me when I tell you that no social worker or judge, for that matter, was keen on taking a child out of their home. For one thing, there was no where to put them once they had been removed (how many foster parent do you know?) There simply weren't foster homes available.<br /><br />And given the fact that the parents had to demonstrate that they could provide a clean, stable home for their children in order to get them back (and visit them regularly etc. while they were in care) many of these children never got to go home.<br /><br />The parents, despite a TREMENDOUS effort on the part of social services, to help them get housing, jobs, drug or alcohol treatment, therapy, etc. did not do what they needed to do. Many of them did not take the situation seriously at all and did not make a real effort to get their acts together.<br /><br />I was trained as a family therapist and had a masters degree in social work. Every cell of my being wanted to reunite these families but it was so depressing I can't even begin to describe it. Every Sunday night I had a pit in my stomach just thinking about what horror awaited me the next day at work.<br /><br />Please do not underestimate neglect. I cannot imagine a judge taking a child away because the parent gave him kool-aid. Seriously?? I did get a case of a 6 week old who, through her mothers neglect, was being fed beer instead of formula by her boyfriend and then was raped with a coke bottle by same boyfriend.<br /><br />I had a little 5 year old whose parents lost custody because both were heroin addicts who allowed him to be in the room while his mother sold herself to men in exchange for drugs (and who was most likely occasionally traded for drugs himself). Once he was taken into care, mom disappeared for good and dad never showed up for scheduled visits and eventually lost custody.<br /><br />The there was the neglectful mom whose home lacked doors, had exterior garbage cans in the house overflowing with garbage, a hole in the ceiling that allowed you to see up to the second floor and through which a child could easily fall, and who thought it was funny that she had trained her youngest (age 2) to act like a dog and bite anyone who came into the house.<br /><br />I could go on and on.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how hard I worked and how hard the child therapists worked and how hard the family therapists assigned to the parents at no charge worked. And usually to no avail whatsoever.<br /><br />The idea that most foster care cases are without merit and that the \"system\" is out to screw the parents is, in my humble opinion, ridiculous! I feel terrible for the parents because most of them are very damaged people and their own childhoods were usually extremely abusive or neglectful as well.<br /><br />But my experience was that they, not their children, were the ones to get the preferential treatment in court. And believe me, no one was out to get their child put into foster care. Instead everything was done to try and help them KEEP their child at home.<br /><br />The children are the ones without a voice or an option or any power of their own. They are the ones whose needs should be put first. This is definitely NOT about<br />kool-aid.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://mamasoncall.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://mamasoncall.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 15}, {"assetID": 1788580, "replies": [], "lft": 84, "assetURL": "http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/a-closer-look-at-alaska/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2454520, "rgt": 85, "userDisplayName": "Yaakov Stern", "createDate": "1282871998", "userID": 54928599, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282884878", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Haven, CT", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282881278", "commentSequence": 39, "commentBody": "The only significant problem one might encounter with this approach is that support for candidates with very low name recognition might stem from pure anti-incumbent sentiment--for example, a candidate with 20% name recognition who is polling at 18% might be getting 10% of the vote from electors who aren't familiar with the candidate, but bear a grudge against the better-known candidate (read: incumbent).  This could lead to the mistaken impression that 90% of voters who know of the candidate support them, while in reality it's more like 40%.

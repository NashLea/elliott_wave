Bill Anderson has a rebuttal here:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://krugman-in-wonderland.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://krugman-in-wonderland.blogspot.com</a>/<br /><br />Krugman has been insisting that the reason the economy is in a funk is because the Obama administration pushed through an $800 billion \"stimulus\" instead of a $1.2 trillion spending package. Yes, that his PK's argument: for lack of $400 billion to be spent on political pet projects, the entire economy is sinking. And never mind that this $400 billion is elsewhere, in the omnibus budget, in cash for clunkers, and the like.<br /><br />There is no model, theory, or logic that says that if a policy implemented X, which causes unemployment to rise Y and when implemented at a level of 2X was observed to cause unemployment to rise 2Y, will somehow cause unemployment to improve when implemented at a 3X lvel. The economy is NOT a \"chasm to be leaped\".<br /><br />Krugman now insists that Benanke's inflation will give the economy \"traction,\" as if an economy is a  machine that just needs a push from monetary authorities to move on its own.<br /><br />Over the last decade, people borrowed too much and misdirected capital too much. Partly because government redirected too many resources to residential housing. Partly because government encouraged too much people to borrow money they could not return. Partly because changes in the Glass-Steagle Act make less clear what would benefit from government bailout. Partly because the Fed kept interest rates too low for too long. Republicans and Democrat alike are responsible, as \"progressivism\" is a mental disease that infects both.<br /><br />And so we had a collapse. Which was bad enough. But that collapse was made far more consequential because government refused to allow the failed components of the economy to \"lquidate\". Instead of having successful auto producers (Ford) by up assets of failed auto producers (GM), \"progressives\" stepped in, used productive assets to bail out failed management, violated laws to give their cronies benefits, and dragged down the economy further.<br /><br />And then came Obamacaer, which is destroying jobs before our eyes, even as over 100 firms and unions scramble to get \"waivers\". And hgher taxes on retained earnings that would otherwise be used to create jobs.<br /><br />And now Krugman advocates \"theft\" of 28% of everyone's dollar-denominated savings as a \"fix\". Regime uncertainty is causing $1 trillion (or is it $2 trillion) to lie fallow. And in this post, yet another series of crony-driven spending programs.<br /><br />What Paul, is 20% real unemployment not enough for you? You want to try for 30%?

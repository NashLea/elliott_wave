Suggestions:<br/><br/>1. allow people to send physical letters by email (eliminates part of the cost of sending letters);<br/>\n2. allow the reverse, by implementing a nationwide, uniform scanning service based on what several private companies do for certain small areas, where you can opt to shred, receive digitally, or receive original paper copies of individual articles.  Though possibly not purely profitable on a nationwide scale, this could substantially reduce costs since many articles of mail could be delivered electronically or shredded without the cost of physical delivery;<br/>\n3. provide infrastructure for directly depositing checks into bank accounts (relies on infrastructure in (2))<br/>\n4. implement optional, permanent, simplified universal mail addresses which would identify recipients without placing physical addresses on letters (simpler, less error prone and more secure).<br/><br/>A nation that can communicate through a wide variety of ways is a stronger one.

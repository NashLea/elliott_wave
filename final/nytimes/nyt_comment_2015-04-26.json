If children don't learn good behavior, manners and respect for others, the world won't love them. It's part of parenting to teach them what the limits are and what positive behavior is. So yes I am going to frown if my child does something wrong. A parent applying unconditional approval to bad behavior creates a child no one wants to experience, and it does the child a disservice. I guess where the unconditional love comes in is that I am forgiving and understanding when they make a mistake. The process takes a long time, and perfect behavior isn't possible or expected.

To save time, I incorporate herein, as if fully set forth herein, the Mundell-Fleming conditions for an optimal currency area:  (1) Labor mobility across the area; (2) Capital mobility and price and wage flexibility across the area; (3) A risk sharing system in the form of a fiscal transfer mechanism for the entire area; and (4) Homogeneity of business cycles across the area.  Mercer County has all four of the foregoing in the dollar currency area, the United States, while in the Eurozone at least 3 and 4, supra, are lacking, which means that the Eurozone can't adjust to equilibrim for some members advantages in competitiveness and the resulting imbalances in trade, except by internal devaluation, nor can it aid members which are experiencing a fiscal crisis.<br/><br/>But Professor Kenen provides perhaps the most insightful analysis of why the dollar area works, while the Eurozone doesn't.

Yes, they are, but notwithstanding, Mississippi et al. would not, I think, be better off with their own currencies.

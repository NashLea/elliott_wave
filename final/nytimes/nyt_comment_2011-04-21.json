The most important requirement, then, is for teachers to learn the content they teach, understand how it is structured, and practice teaching by steps.  The example given for negative numbers, also incorporates practical experience, that is, using examples that illustrate, on the student's level, how to solve a problem, or understand a concept.  To a large extent, special education teachers (I was one), learn to do this with students who have difficulty learning.

The rehabilitating needs to happen _before_ children become murderers. And for God's sake (and the sake of everyone),  it is essential that federal and state governments make the ownership--even the manufacture-- of guns and ammunition extremely limited.  Yes, I'm going to put a political comment in my opinion here too: the GOP continues to de-fund important programs for children and youth (and their families) that help the younger generation to be prepared for, and aspire to, much loftier and legal goals than being criminals (drug dealers, prostitutes, thieves, and so on). And the GOP --but also the Democrats-- continue to bow to the power of the NRA and refuse to put very, very strong laws in place to prevent the manufacture and sales of weapons. On these policies do I put much of the blame for the creation and arming of young criminals such as the ones described in this article.<br/>\nIf you compare the violent, gun-loving U.S. with other countries (such as Canada) where sales and ownership of guns is extremely low (in particular when compared with the United States), you will see that gun violence is much less in those other countries. Hmm. We should think about that.<br/>\nFurthermore, our schools and other institutions should provide excellent, appropriate, and affordable (or free) counseling to children and youth who show a propensity for crime and violence, and counsel the families and care-givers too.<br/>\nObviously we can't prevent every child from committing a crime--even a heinous crime--but we could sure do a lot better.

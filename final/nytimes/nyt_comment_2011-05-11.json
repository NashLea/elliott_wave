This was the result of the Kearney movement begun by Dennis Kearney, an Irish immigrant who was upset because the Chinese, after being laid off from building the railroads, were taking the lower paying jobs and physical labor. A 1913 California law barred Sikhs from owning land, even though the facts presented to the supreme Court showed they are Caucasians, the court ruled they were Asians. Today we exclude others form coming here who are willing to do these low paying hard labor jobs, in order to protect American labor. From the Capitalistic point of view, this is Socialism in action. For the neo-classical economists, Capitalism does not recognize borders. It calls for the free movement of labor and capital. Employers should be able to hire the best labor at the lowest rates, that is Capitalism. So when a Conservative rises in opposition to immigrant labor, and in particular, seasonal labor, just to satisfy some constituency, he/she is not practicing Capitalism, but is instead engaging in the hypocrisy of supporting Socialism.<br/><br/>It is also curious that those who claim to be the biggest champions of freedom and the right to revolt against oppressive governments, are willing to send the most vulnerable of these immigrants back to a life of poverty and subservience. While the Conservatives are lining up to support revolutions in Arabic countries, brought on by poverty, lack of employment and education, those who would risk everything just to come here and harvest lettuce, or melons, or oranges, are attacked as being criminals. <br/><br/>How can these Conservatives professing Christianity, find it in their nature to send young people who have never know another home, to a country where they do not speak the language, and even the culture is foreign to them. We frequently see very bright young people who are eligible to attend the best universities, sent away, or if the do graduate, denied the ability to apply that knowledge, all in the name of a contradictory demagoguery. <br/><br/>We see families who have made a home here, bought cars, houses, appliances, paid property taxes, and through the use of false Social Security numbers, paid into a system that they will not be able to collect from. And that kind of injustice is cheered on by the Conservatives. Even more hypocritical is the position of the Tea Party and Libertarians, who of all people should be for open borders for labor. <br/><br/>What is the difference between granting asylum to political refugees, while turning away economic refugees? By what moral code do you deliberately send hard working productive people back to unemployment and poverty? The founding fathers would be aghast at this practice. They made it plain that America was to be a place where others could come and make a new start in life. People risked everything to come here. They sailed in steerage under miserable conditions. They left their families and what few goods they had to come and do the hardest labor possible, and they did it willingly. Today we have that same spirit with these \"Illegal Aliens,\" but they are not Europeans, they are Latin Americans, and they are being treated much as the Chinese, Sikhs, Filipinos, and other non Europeans were treated before them.<br/><br/>The invective, the outright hatred, the denigration of them and their culture is a continuation of those previous movements against them, and it is led by those whose motives are suspect.<br/><br/>I ask you: What do these right wing talking heads have to gain by creating this culture of hostility toward those who only want to escape oppressive governments and poverty? Who profits from denying these people the same liberties their ancestors came here for? Just what kind of moral cretins are these people. Look at them and see just what their values are.

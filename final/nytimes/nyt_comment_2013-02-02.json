She removed food items from her diet for weeks at a time and kept notes on symptoms and then reintroduced them until she verified if they affected her arthritis.  Over a period of several months she arrived at a diet that she kept to the end of her life. She died at 89 without ever spending a single hour on a wheelchair. Lifetime cost to insurance for medicine = zero. <br/><br/>Preparing food was the first order of business everyday because she did not want to make food decisions when hungry. She controlled both what and how much to eat . So she prepared her lunch and dinner in the morning and never deviated from the regiment she carefully had devised. She also developed a protocol for daily physiotherapy to go with the diet. <br/><br/>She had not gone to medical school and in fact she did not learn how to read and write until her late twenties when my grandfather taught her how to read.

I am a 37 year old adoptee, who is now a mother, and while I have had my \"curious\" moments (what do they look like, what do they do), none those moments have led me to meet my birth parents, even though I have the information.  Even when both of my adoptive parents died, I did not seek them out.  I, like Colin, had a 19 year old birth mother and an absent birth father.   Contrary to Mr. Reilly's opinion,  an adoptee does not have to meet his/her birth parents to be complete, nor do adoptees owe their birth parents anything.    To even suggest this is unconscionable.  While I appreciate the sacrifice my birth mother made, it is such a deeply personal decision to contact her, the most personal decision for an adoptee.   I really wish the media would focus only on his talent and football, and not something so excruciatingly difficult.

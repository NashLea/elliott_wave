And surviving the treatment is easier given a good prognosis, so that was a big help.  I did have an episode of worry, but it turned out to be a panic attack caused by a medication imbalance.  I sometimes wonder whether my attitude during my brutal radiation treatment was kind of pathological, as I didn't go through the stages of grief or \"why me?\"  (Why not me?

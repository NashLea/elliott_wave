Timothy Egan would rather have a pope pretend there was no sin at all \u2014 except, of course, owning property.<br/><br/>As for the heretics of the Middle Ages to whom he alludes, they were called the Cathars, and they were a bloody, repressive, and intolerant lot. To tolerate them was to abdicate responsibility for the protection of those who lived in the precincts where they thrived.<br/><br/>Finally, Francis' vaunted simplicity wasn't simply some flower child na\u00efvet\u00e9. It was a radical attempt to purge himself of all that distracted him from a devotion to God. That meant celibacy as well as poverty.<br/><br/>I've come over time to dislike the endless adulation of Francis. I'd like to think that has less to do with finding his example unacceptable than because I can no longer stand the blind, insipid, dishonest way he's been invoked to excuse every kind of laid-back lassitude advocated by contemporary secularists.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3363156, "replies": [], "lft": 49, "assetURL": "http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/detained-deported-and-determined/", "parentID": 8518191, "commentID": 8526379, "rgt": 50, "userDisplayName": "Barbara Michel", "createDate": "1363313278", "userID": 30682849, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1363320893", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Toronto ON", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1363317293", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Thanks for calling attention to this; it makes the people photographed stand out so that we look at them as human beings  (Slides 4 and 10) and not as illegal immigrants.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3363355, "replies": [], "lft": 260, "assetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/jpmorgan-faulted-on-controls-and-disclosure-in-trading-loss/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8527060, "rgt": 261, "userDisplayName": "Jack  Chicago", "createDate": "1363320881", "userID": 37411144, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1363320906", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1363317306", "commentSequence": 76, "commentBody": "I'm shocked, no stunned.

The real question is why we feel we have to visit Aunt Mildred three times a year instead of once every two years, which we were both quite thrilled with at the time.  One might ask the same thing about being in contact with everyone one has ever met in one's life all year long rather than those one feels close to, just through (rather long and thoughtful) messages written in Christmas or other holiday cards, plus the occasional phone call during the year.  Once upon a time, new inventions made it easier for us to do things we already did, like wash clothes and climb stairs.  Now, they make things faster, but not necessarily easier and certainly not always more pleasant.  They seem to result in less free time rather than more.  I think the personal computer was a great invention, but it is also clear that one result (intentional?) was that it would make it possible for those who control various bits of our lives to make us do more for them, not less.  Ditto the cell phone and its spinoffs.  The jumbo jet and deregulation came into being, without considering anything but one of their consequences, the cheaper ticket.

Legalize drugs, already.  People will use drugs whether it's legal or not.  If addicts want to kill themselves with drugs, so what?  It's more Social Security for the rest of us.  Many states have right-to-die laws.  How is decriminalizing drug use any different?  Keeping drugs illegal profits only lawyers, judges, cops, prison guards, rehab clinics, halfway houses, doctors, hospitals, drug companies, etc. but disenfranchises the rest of us.  It's the main reason many of us visit a doctor - to renew our prescription - and why our health care system is bankrupting us.  Like alcohol Prohibition in the 1930s when the widespread and open consumption of alcohol made a mockery of civil society, stiff drugs penalties are bankrupting our states where prisons are so filled to capacity we let loose murderers.  Drug profits fund narco-states and terrorist organizations and inadvertently our military-industrial/big pharma-medical complex.  And our War on Drugs undermines our freedoms as we descend ever more into a police state.  Enough already.

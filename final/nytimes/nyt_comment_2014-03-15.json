I don't know what hobby you enjoy but imagine if it was highly regulated and expensive as gun ownership is in New York City. Imagine that each item of your equipment had to be registered at a cost of $140 per item. Imagine that you get a letter from the police that their records indicate you are in possession of an item that was legal when you bought and registered it but is now illegal because of a new law. You have the option of immediately and permanently getting it out of the city with documented proof, immediately turning it over to the police if you can't get it out of the city immediately, turn it in to the cops while you figure out how to remove or sell it or document destruction or permanent alteration by a licensed professional. Are you OK with that? As far as what my Marlin 39A is worth, you display the ignorance most non-gun owners have about firearms. A new 39A costs $650. Depending on age and condition used ones sell for $400-$700 or higher. I paid $350 for my 1970s 39A three years ago. I couldn't replace it with a similar rifle in New York City because all .22 lever action rifles hold more than 5 rounds. NYC outlawed them all including Annie Oakley's favorite. Little did she know she was shooting an assault weapon. I love NY but hate its laws which is why I am moving to PA where gun laws still make sense.

I can hardly wait to hear Glen Beck riff on that whopper!<br/><br/>Your melodramatic and misleading statement will no doubt fire up the unthinking on both sides of the gun rights/gun control issue.  But is it true?  <br/><br/>NO!  <br/><br/>If you can't tell the difference between an opinion piece with a personal byline and and editorial stating the position of the NYTimes itself, how can we have an intelligent conversation?<br/><br/>The main takeaway from this opinion piece is that it is not true that mandatory sentencing for gun violations diminishes gun crimes by putting gun criminals away, and that they also act as deterrence.  Studies indicate otherwise.<br/><br/>The author also compares mandatory sentences for drug-related crimes, which have filled our prisons to overflowing. The U.S., to its shame, has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world. <br/><br/>California's 3 strikes law has been an abysmal failure, and since its redaction several years ago, studies indicate that prisoners originally incarcerated for minor drug crimes and released under the changed laws have committed new crimes at a significantly lower rate than other released prisoners. <br/><br/>Whatever your ideas about gun crimes (or drug crimes) the article indicates that mandatory sentence are often unjust and do not lead to the outcomes legislators who draft them think they do.

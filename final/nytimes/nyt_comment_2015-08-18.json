Even among these species the young are susceptible to predation.  Prehistoric humans were near, but not at the top of their food webs. With the advent of culture and civilization we have, with a few rural exceptions, eliminated or isolated our predators, and thus moved to the top of our food webs.  This is entirely natural and ethical since essentially every sentient organism (and many plants) engage in active predator avoidance.  Cruelty in predation is the norm, and indeed, only humans would even recognize the notion of cruelty in the act of acquiring food.  As ethical beings it is appropriate for humans to define norms in the way we harvest other animals for food that minimize cruelty as we ourselves experience it and define it.  And those norms can be expected to evolve over time.  But I see no intrinsic ethical imperative to extricate ourselves from predatory food webs.  Humans are members of a large branch of primates that kill animals to eat meat as part of their diet, and we are in company with a vast number of other such species.  I respect vegans and vegetarians as I do any other ethically motivated or religious group.  But their beliefs do not mark the non-negotiable baseline of human ethical behavior.

There is a distortion field around the brain that prevents facts from entering.<br/><br/>Several yrs. ago, I watched the very first episode of \"Undercover Boss\" on CBS. This is a show where the top guy pretends to be a low level employee getting experience within the company. The guy who was the boss on that first show, whose name I now forget, seemed a decent fellow, but if you paid attention closely, it was beyond question that he had no idea how his decisions were being handed down and how much impact they had and, further, no idea of the hard work and struggles of the lower economic set who get by week by week running on burned out energy and exhausted hopes.<br/><br/>We are becoming a nation where cruelty, exploitation and quick termination are the norms, not the exception. These are the processes whereby bosses get gigantic bonuses bigger than the lifetime pay of most workers, shareholders get dividends and higher prices and, before yesterday, Jeff Bezos got profiled repeatedly as one of the smartest, most effective business leaders in the world.

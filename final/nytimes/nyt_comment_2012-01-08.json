Casting aspersions has no bearing upon the necessity of locking some people up. On the other hand, should homosexuality be criminalized?

I don't recall homosexuality (let alone homosexual marriage) being covered there, or did Moses just neglect to bring one of those tablets down with him from Sinai?  People should be incarcerated when they harm other people.  Gay marriage harms no one.  Nor does it invalidate heterosexual marriage.  Okay?

If I recall the UConn men's program has had some decent final four success against Duke (1999, 2004) and Kentucky (2014).  So for 25% of the time in the past 16 years, UConn with 4 championships has outperformed the Dukes, Kentucky's and Louisville's of the world. Even without getting many of the all-Americans.  This speaks volumes of what good coaching can do. UConn, perennially underrated by sports commentators, ignorantly undervalued when elite conferences come calling and pulling lesser lights to their fold - plays on. I hope Geno has a chip on his shoulder as I do - and will stick around for a decade and more.  I hope Kevin O. has the same fire and success that Calhoun had.  I hope that the men's soccer team and women's field hockey team continue to be national contenders/champions.  I hope the polo team continues to be best in the nation year after year.  The hockey teams are rising.  Baseball is rising. Perhaps it's time for the world of sports to recognize that UConn, minus the football program - is the nation's elite sports university.

It's about fairness in terms of each team being given the best chance of competing for a championship down the road. To do otherwise--reward success and punish failure--would be to essentially destroy competitiveness within a sport, and ultimately the sport itself. Just imagine the Patriots or the Packers getting a top1-5 pick every year--ridiculous if you want competition. Obviously, the college game of basketball is set up differently, and winners tend to get better players and perpetuate their success. That's a competitive issue, but teams like Wisconsin are living proof that top-flight home-grown athletes that are well-coached can beat the most physically gifted.

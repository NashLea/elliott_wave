I sincerely hope you will follow through on the speech you made today. I applaud you for saying what many prior U.S. Presidents have been afraid to say, fearing retaliation from AIPAC. I applaud you for putting your re-election at jeopardy to \"say the right thing\"!\r<br/><br/>For obvious reasons, it is in the interest of the United States to see peace in the Middle East. Israel needs to understand this. Israel also needs to realize that it is in their long term interest to make peace with their brethren, the Arab Palestinians. After all they are from the same stock: Phillistines. What separates them is religion, which has created more hate in this World than love. If they were to step back they would realize that they are all human beings and all \"God's Chosen People\". God does not discriminate.\r<br/><br/>Of course, in order to do this, both sides need to forget the bloodshed and mistakes of the past and accept each other as they are. It means that all the leaders have to embrace a bold (and novel) approach, even if it means losing the next election. It means that Arab Palestinians accept that Israel is a reality that is not going to go away. Israel needs to treat its brethren fairly and justly. Arab Palestinians need to stop lobbying rockets across the border and Israel needs to stop taking all the prime land and water resources away from Arab Palestinians.\r<br/><br/>As Lord Acton said: \"A politician is person who looks to the next election. A Statesman is a person who looks to the next generation\". I hope both you and Prime Minister Netenyahu can rise above the rabble and act like Statesmen and not mere politicians.\r<br/><br/>Most Americans are tired of supporting, politically, financially and militarily, our alleged ally in the Middle East.

The waste comes from the docs who order MRI after MRI w/o any concrete reason, who choose brand names over generics 'cause that's how they roll (or because they simply can't be bothered to educate their patients), who 'feed the beast' by referring their patients to the same specialists they play squash with on the weekends, who drag their patients in for more follow-up visits than necessary, who always order the full panel when they only need a specific result, who perform surgeries that are no better than non-invasive therapy, on and on.

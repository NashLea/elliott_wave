Pigeons and water tanks are not the problem but biofilms formed by water in high rises is.  Equally dangerous for some people are hot tubs and humidifiers.  The only filter that can actually remove these so-called NTMs from faucets and shower heads is made by Pall Corporation, lasts for about two months, and costs about $60.  Other filters are useless to filter out NTMs.  <br/><br/>I, along with many others diagnosed with this serious, sometimes life-threatening condition, no longer take showers but only take baths.

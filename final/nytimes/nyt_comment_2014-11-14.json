In 1953 my parents came first, they rented a house, bought cars etc. - In 1954 I followed last, and was soon drafted (those days military service was equally a duty for American and immigrants). I was glad to serve because it made feel that I belong here. In fact, I'm proud of my military service, I feel it the draft should be restored, not only because it would reduce teen and young adult unemployment, but, because it unites us all. That's my short history, and I think it should be the history of all immigrants, whether they come through the front door as I did, or the back door as these 11 million our system forces to lurk in the shadows, most of them productive tax payers. So much for how documented immigrants should feel about the undocumented. As to other countries that have had to incorporate thousands and foreign workers into their economies and societies, whether they came by the tens of thousands in boat loads, with and without papers, I'd cite Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy.

School-aged children can't be toted along on assignments.  Even the statement, \"A generation of female photographers is looking to one another for advice and support as they raise children while still going on assignment overseas\" strains credulity for me.

Bottom line is that for me, this article doesn't at all reflect what it's like to be a mother and a photojournalist, 25 years ago or now. I could be wrong, but I think I'm the only female photojournalist to win a (non-staff) Pulitzer Prize while raising kids and definitely the only single mom...and while nothing is impossible, the degree of difficulty is off the charts!

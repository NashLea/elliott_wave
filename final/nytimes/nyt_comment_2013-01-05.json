In \"The Rise and Decline of Nations\", published in 1982, Mancur Olson, a distinguished economist, explains how stable, affluent societies get in trouble.  In Olson\u2019s view, successful countries breed interest groups that become more and more powerful with time.  The groups win government favors, in the form of new laws or friendly regulators that benefit them at everyone else\u2019s expense.  Not only do they grab a larger piece of the economic pie, but they stop the pie from growing as much as it could.  Professor Olson\u2019s thesis on the power of moneyed special interest and its bad effect on the economy has been supported many times over since his study.  For example, look at what Google could do with about $25 million in lobbying to escape anti-trust enforcement.  <br/><br/>In my two decades of trying to introduce superconducting Maglev, it has been very frustrating to try and overcome the power of other transport interests and prove that this system is faster, cheaper, and much more energy efficient than steel-wheeled rail systems."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7997628, "replies": [], "commentID": 7998846, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Len Charlap", "createDate": "1357392229", "userID": 288945, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1357399514", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 12, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Kevin Rothstein", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Princeton, NJ", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1357399514", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "In \"Wealth and Democracy.\" Kevin Phillips  points out that there is a feedback in economic distribution because as the rich get richer, they use their wealth to get more power. They then use their power to get more wealth and so on. There seems to be a tipping point where this process becomes impossible to reverse. When inequality becomes bad enough, the country suffers. This process has been going on for centuries. Chrystia Freeland used 14th century Venice to illustrate this process in a recent article, but history is replete with other examples. It appears that at some point the process becomes impossible to reverse. <br/><br/>According to Phillips, the great success of America has been that before the tipping point was reached, something has always happened that reversed the flow of money upwards, e.g. the rise of unions, FDR's reforms.

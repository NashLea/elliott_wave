That team is not the team it was either. Also, their own talent came back to bight them. Because of their quick playoffs, they lost all momentum in the long days leading up to the Series. I also think that Ubaldo Jimenez is A serious threat for the Cy Young. He throws 95-100 mph throughout the entire game, leaving hitters  devastated.

I am a Catholic who married and raised my child outside the Catholic church, precisely because I rejected the Church's irrational, rigid, unhealthy doctrines on sexuality and gender.  Nor did I want my child -- a boy, as it turns out -- to absorb the paternalism of the Church hierarchy.<br /><br />Yet I have always had great admiration for the grassroots, progressive nuns, priests and lay workers who toil tirelessly, at home and abroad, on behalf of the neglected and poor.  My first \"charitable contribution\"  -- $1.67 -- was made, at age 9, to the Maryknoll sisters (my parents subscribed to their monthly magazine).  Even now, I contribute monthly to my former parish in Manhattan, an upper-West Side institution, built in 1900 and staffed by Franciscans, that serves a trilingual population -- Dominican, Creole and English-speaking  -- and has a choir and masses in each language (all 3 choirs sing at the Christmas Eve service).  The Church also operates an elementary school,  thrift shop, food kitchen, and senior center.   It exemplifies in practice what Catholicism should be about.  Moreover, I believe your story about the jeep-driving Maryknoll;  one of the sisters at my Catholic elementary school used to hitch up her habit and run (she wore bobby socks) whenever a kid needed her in a hurry.<br /><br />The Catholic patriarchy has taken some well-deserved blows recently, including from your colleague, the inestimable Maureen Dowd.  The Church certainly needs more \"Marys\" (and \"Maureens\") and less old boys.  Yet we who grew up Catholic, and have known outstanding priests and nuns, recognize that, Catholic doctrine aside, these individuals are true humanists and progressives, who serve people, not ideology.  I'm glad that you've helped to set the record straight.

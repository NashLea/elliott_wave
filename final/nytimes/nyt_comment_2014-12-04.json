My opinion of the police has changed radically after several more recent encounters.  Many of the officers are overly aggressive, to the point of being frightening.  It's going to take more than simply moving police away from street stops and marijuana arrests to change their image.

Steady rain, uncleared snowy/icy sidewalks, or enervating summer heat are the only impediments.<br/>Years ago I tried jogging and didn't like it. It also has to be undertaken as a form of deliberate exercise, as opposed to walking, which is a reasonable form of locomotion and can be combined with public transport as needed.<br/>A few years ago I got a simple pedometer that I put in my pocket in the morning and take out at night. Most days I walk about 10,000 steps, plus or minus. I like to walk fast.  A childhood in NYC with a long legged father, himself a New Yorker set my pace. and I often pass other pedestrians, most of whom are younger than me. My pedometer measures the speed of my pace and at the end of a week about 30 to 40% of my steps are \"aerobic.\" I don't think I would do better if I put on running shoes and jogged. I'd have to make some kind of circle and have to come home to change my clothing. With walking I can just keep going about my business.

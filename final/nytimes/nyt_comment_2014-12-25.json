It is hard for one to accurately contradict this allegation unless one actually lives in that city. I do not but I will offer an observation that may appear to oppose this view.  Anyone living in a college town knows that athletes are under the microscope for any and all behavior that they display. Not only social but academic &amp; civic. Many universities offer special time set aside to give the athlete advice if not outright training in expected deportment. Behavior is headlines and local law enforcement officials are proud of it. Not just headlines in a college town but throughout the state if not the country. And when it does occur it is met with such disdain that the coach is forced to take some disciplinary action regardless of what law enforcement does.  If the punishment seems somewhat trivial vs the crime editorials quickly appear in the local newspaper decrying favoritism if not questioning the integrity of the entire program. If the article is suggesting that everyone in FL is a fan of college football then it differs from any other state I have livid in. Most citizens are not college football fans but certainly condemn rape under any circumstances. However, those that do call themselves fans pull for only one school and really dislike the \"other\" school.

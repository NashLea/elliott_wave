Larger rescues, such as local SPCAs and local humane societies, may take in thousands of animals a year. Whether large or small, the vast majority take in disadvantaged animals. They reduce the pressure on public shelters by pulling and rehoming pets. And in many cases they take on the financial responsibility for medical care or behavioral intervention. The rescue community in and around NYC takes a huge medical burden off the public NY Animal Care Centers. In my state, Old Dog Haven pulls senior dogs from public shelters and places them with fosters, paying for all medical care.<br/><br/>Third, the definition of No Kill is not 90%.

Even the figure of 90% is based just on a group of people who got together and decided they liked that number better than 85% or 95% for whatever reasons it made sense to them. Just as your chosen definition is \"every healthy and treatable animal\". I mean, if an animal is treatable why need it be healthy?<br/><br/>I worked in animal rescue in Massachusetts for many years and my assertion that many \"no kill\" rescues cherry picked the animals they admitted was based on facts and experience. The organization I worked for would often bring them cats when they ran out (since we never ran out of cats being open admission). And the cats they took were the young and healthy. <br/><br/>The group I worked for took no tax dollars. Not all large shelters do. Depends on the state. And the people who worked and volunteered there were heroes who endured and witnessed things \"regular people\" could never imagine. Every euthanasia decision was tough whether it was the hundreds of ducks taken in one night from a restaurant housing them in a basement covered in dead animals to every starving, untrained dog to each neglected horse, pig, mouse, fish and bunny to the wildlife taken in and transported to rehabs all over the state.

An open shelter, like the MSPCA in Massachusetts, never turns away an animal. They are never \"full\". Thus, they can never be no kill, however that is defined (more on that in a moment). Space, mentioned here as \"simple\" is not simple at all. It's a very complicated, mathematical reality that every open shelter must deal with.<br/>Shelters with the luxury of turning away animals can easily call themselves no kill. If you are only taking in small numbers of young, healthy animals without behavior problems, then you will probably find homes for every one of them, eventually. Those shelters are often the most vocal in criticizing shelters they define as \"high kill\" yet never reveal to their adopting and donating public that t they don't take in cats over five years old or with disabilities or medical problems. <br/><br/>Regarding the definition of no kill being 90% live release rate, this is completely fabricated from a small number of groups with no authority and no objective analysis. A shelter that does high numbers of spay and release will have a huge live release rate even if they are euthanizing large numbers of animals for space. And a shelter that turns away no animals, no matter what type or how sick, will a large 'kill' ratio that says nothing of how humanely and rationally the euthanasia decisions are made.<br/>People want a quick answer and catch phrase that tells them what the right thing to do is.

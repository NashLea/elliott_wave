I teach entrepreneurs how to launch startups and find it interesting how there are those who get the business model and can take it and run with it, then there are those who get it but realize they need help achieving their goals.<br/>\nPersonally, I like what you mention about the best entrepreneurs are not necessarily the A  students. I was always a good student, but bored to death in school and felt that there were bigger challenges out there waiting for me. Sounds like there are more out there like me.<br/><br/>Marla Bosworth<br/>\nCEO<br/>\nBack Porch Soap Company<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.backporchsoap.com\" title=\"http://www.backporchsoap.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.backporchsoap.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3308195, "replies": [], "lft": 27, "assetURL": "http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/the-g-o-p-s-fuzzy-delegate-math/", "parentID": 5605329, "commentID": 5606046, "rgt": 28, "userDisplayName": "Matthew H", "createDate": "1330236415", "userID": 61407122, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1330236436", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Montana", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1330236436", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "Well, it certainly has come up in various cases, both in front of the Supreme Court and at lower courts.

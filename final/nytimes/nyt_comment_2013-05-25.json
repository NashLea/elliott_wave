I.E., bankers relate to the central banks the same way farmers once related to the Department of Agriculture's price supports for agricultural commodities. Like farmers the bankers claim to deal with risk and uncertainty that would paralyze ordinary mortals in fear. Like the DOA, central banks dutifully do all that they can to make banks profitable and eliminate that risk and uncertainty.<br/><br/>There is a complication. Farmers only needed DOA to control one economic variable per market. The central banks however are asked to systematically influence two economic variables--interest rates and inflation rates--a two-genie-one-bottle problem. Hence, the bankers see the potential for something to slip out of control. Thus, they demand extremely low inflation rates to give themselves a deep buffer against spiking interest rates.<br/><br/>The central banks know that they need to pay lip service to various economic variables that weigh on the common good, but they are bankers who know that they must take care of bankers. They seem to believe that the world's fortunes must compromised in order to hold inflation to 2%.

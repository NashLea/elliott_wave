My daughter had a lovely handmade dollhouse we bought for her in Maine and I well recall 1 hour trips to the dollhouse shoppe in Lancaster to find items for her house.  Later on I created hundreds of miniature reproduction paintings which I sold on eBay for anywhere from $29.99 to $80 each.  For a few years there until corporate ruined the experience, eBay had one of the finest miniature buying experiences you could possibly imagine.  They even had a specialized group of miniature artisans.  Alas Meg Whitman came along and ruined everything.

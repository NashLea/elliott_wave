So Houghton thinks 94% of CO2 flux is naturally occurring. \"Far in excess\" seems to fit pretty well. <br/><br/>Revelle &amp; Seuss (Tellus, vol. 9, pp 18-27, 2957) calculated that the amount of atmospheric CO2 due to human activities was 1.2 to 1.7% of the total.<br/><br/>Jaworowski, Z (EIR Science, Mar 16, 2007, pp38-53) reckons that \"97%  of the total annual emission of CO2 into the atmosphere comes from natural emissions of the land and sea: human beings add a mere 3%. this man-made 3% of CO2 emissions is responsible for a tiny fraction of the total greenhouse effect, probably close to 0.12%\"<br/><br/>So CO2 is indeed produced by natural sources \"far in excess\" of man-made sources.

Even as Mrs. Thomas was collecting her big donor money in the kitchen, Mr. Thomas was in the library writing an opinion that ensured the big donors could maintain their anonymity. That's one way to stuff the family cookie jar.<br /><br />Still, Mrs. Thomas was annoyed. She was especially annoyed when Jackie Calmes reported on the Thomas' secret piggy bank. Mrs. Thomas must have tossed &amp; turned all night. (Contrary to speculation, Jake Tapper of ABC News, who has heard the audio tape, said she sounded \"sober.\") Lucky for Ms. Calmes that Mrs. Thomas didn't have her number. Too bad for Prof. Hill that her phone number was probably in the university directory.<br /><br />Mrs. Thomas' crank call was likely perfectly legal. But what about her husband's perjury? In his testimony before the committee, Clarence Thomas unequivocally denied all of Ms. Hill's assertions. Are we really going to let that go? If you or I got a job based on a false resume, &amp; our employer found out about it, we would be fired. The American people should fire Clarence Thomas. If he won't resign, the House should bring articles of impeachment.<br /><br />Ms. McEwen, who is trying to sell a book, isn't the only witness. Ann Woolner of Bloomberg News reminds us that there were several others -- that we know about. Ellen Wells, Susan Hoerchner, John Carr &amp; Joel Paul all testified at Thomas' hearing. Angela Wright &amp; Rose Jourdain spoke to the committee staff. Lillian McEwen made herself available to the staff, but they chose not to interview her. In one way or another, these women &amp; men all backed up Hill's assertions. Woolner thinks Ms. Thomas should have called some of these witnesses before she dialed Hill, which proved to be a big mistake.<br /><br />Lying to the Congress is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. And we have a Supreme Court Justice who, allegedly of course, ought to be in jail instead of sitting in judgment. But I'd suggest giving him the same deal Vice President Spiro Agnew got -- allow Thomas to resign. Soon, please.<br /><br />Clarence Thomas' relationships with women were apparently highly problematic. That his wife brought them out for a new generation to titter over is one of life's fine ironies. Perhaps now he wishes he had been more honest with his wife. Had he been so, she would have resigned herself to collecting from fat cats &amp; not felt the need to try to vindicate a man who appears to have done many women wrong.

This process of accepting everything as \u201cAn interesting point of view\u201d will be the death of the Democratic party. Have we no adults who know a lie when they hear one? Must everything be analyzed as if it is \u201c serious issue needing to be examined\u201d? Are their no triers of facts able to Judge the truth? Nothing less than bullying their way through, daring you to call them out has been the avenue that has afforded these liars and crooks to gain a stranglehold of our government and allowed them to keep us from prospering. When I supported Mr. Obama, when I donated to Mr. Obama it was with a hope that he would lead the Democratic party forward with a clear eye toward condemning and convicting those who would obfuscate and determine to trick the American people into believing more of their lies. It was because I believed he would stand up and draw a line in the sand. Instead he has tried, on multiple occasion to \u201cget along\u201d with them. It took me over 50 years to learn to accept that some people just \u201care not that into you\u201d and sincerely want to cause you harm.<br /><br />I have developed a saying that I use when I find out people want to hurt me: I will prove to you that I love you by doing something for you the devil will never do: I am going to leave you alone!

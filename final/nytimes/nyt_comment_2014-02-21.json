They ignore that spending reflects demand.<br/><br/>Ignored, too, is the fact that an economy as large as the US can rarely grow faster than the global aggregate. Just as interest rates are constrained by the zero lower bound, the US macro economy is limited by domestic and international demand, and with China slowing and Europe experiencing stagnant employment and a double dip recession with slow growth even now, demand was not supported or created at home or aboard.<br/><br/>The GOP isolation of the economy, except for borrowing (overtly ascribed to China, another clich\u00e9!) is a political distortion, whose purpose is blame not to produce sound policy.<br/><br/>Actually, the US led the global recovery, not lagged behind it; another measure that the GOP claims of fault are not true.<br/><br/>Ask Republicans when the bubbles burst, where does demand come from? Increase demand. There you will find jobs. It's hard, as Rep. Jim Clyburn said, to gave a person a tax cut who does have one. And, as Paul says, look at Europe; austerity doesn't bring prosperity out of a recession.

I am a lucky dog.  I actually am a federal employee retiree with the old CS pension and insurance.  I didn't realize how rare a pension and retirement insurance was until 10-15 yrs ago.  My retired at 50 or so cop brother-in-law never pays a nickel for any medical cost although his cop union forgot about spouses in that.  I still pay 25-30% of all costs.  I remember when insurance and providers were not very expensive before I started working for the big bad gov in 72 part time.  Didn't get the ins till 76.  My daughter was born in 74 and total cost was a whopping $500.  And docs would accept payment of $10/mo with no complaint.  Gas was 50 cents.  Yup prices have gone up, but how much have working peoples wages gone up to match?<br/><br/>Something really needs to change.  The ACA was a conservative Heritage plan from the 90's.  No wonder they hate it, they haven't come up with anything worthwhile in 30 yrs unless you count major tax cuts for the wealthy.  The ACA needs to change.

Rowling wrote the Harry Potter novels while she was on the dole, and wrote about that fact herself. The question was not whether or not the freedom to be choosier about jobs is going to make everybody super successful. The question is whether or not giving people a cushion of safety has benefits that can outweigh losses. For example, in the old days, kids might have to forgo college in order to help support their families if their parents fell on hard times. Do you think that was better for their bottom line?  The children of middle and upper class families are routinely shielded from the need to take any and every job that comes their way, and, on the whole, they seem to do quite well for themselves. <br/><br/>I would argue that you are certainly making a political point by choosing to view an 84 acre former army base with less than 1000 residents, many of whom were committed to living highly unstructured lives, as an example of the failure of a social safety net. I suggest that if you look at Kibbutzim in Israel, for example, you might find a considerable number of artists and authors who reside in them. And in fact, the Kibbutzim were traditionally known as a source of top military officers in the army, which I believe went along with the ethos of doing one's part for society. In fact, I believe in most militaries, the ethos is very much one of being part of a larger group.

So many young men and innocents of real drive by shootings in cities across this country end up injured in the spine or head, and need a lifetime of care. And most of these people have no insurance -- even if they had it, if they can't work after being shot, they lose their job, their income and their ability to pay their premiums, thus losing their healthcare. Hospitals, then states and we taxpayers pay enormous sums to stablize, save them, and follow up with care.<br />That's one reason our healthcare is one of the highest costing in the world -- because we end up paying for victims of our violent society.<br />But if Republicans really wanted to save taxpayers money, they would ban all semi-automatic and automatic weapons.

This is the kind of horror you never forget. In a very small, isolated town, the impact of violence is ten times greater than in a city, because you know the people involved and have a sense of community and caring. The son survived, but everyone in that community learned a lesson.<br /><br />On the other side of the question, I was fortunate to be a reporter in Portugal during the post revolutionary period. The citizens there emptied out the storehouses of the military getting guns for themselves. The Spanish were rumored to be smuggling in vast supplies of weapons to aid the forces of suppression and oppression. In that case, the guns in the hands of so many citizens, with so many willing to die to stop the imposition of a new dictatorship, acted as a deterrent to the government and its armies when considering the imposition of force against the population.<br /><br />Guns in a urban environment, in the hands of untrained and inexperienced people, represent great danger and little deterrence. The introduction of one gun into a place of conflict requires more guns and adds to the risk of deadly violence. If a citizen had been immediately present last Saturday in Tucson, there is very little chance they could have stopped the shooting any faster than it was stopped. Additionally, there would have been great risk of the citizen hitting by-standers and even killing more. If the police are called to a scene and someone is shooting to stop a shooting, they would have no idea who the bad guy or the good guy was. They would act with lethal force against the citizen.<br /><br />Having said all of this, there is a false notion in our cities that the police can and will protect you. Their role, in 9 times out of 10 cases or even more, is to clean up the crime scene, do a thorough investigation and hope that the guilty parties fall into the police net one way or another. While many police officers have given their lives saving citizens, that is not their intention, and police commanders work assiduously to see that their officers are not put in life threatening situations. Unlike the movies, police typically do not enter into highly dangerous situations intentionally. They are sometimes trapped in them.<br /><br />Take, as one imperfect example, the sad, sad case of the family in Connecticut where three members of the family were killed and only the father survived.  From what I know, the police did not enter the house even though they had both the call from the neighbor about the heavily injured father and kidnapped mother. It seems (without a full time line) that the police held back. I wish someone would clarify those events.<br /><br />Until the creation of the \"active shooter profile\" following Columbine, police officers were often prevented by their commanders from trying to insert themselves into mass killings. They were often forced to stand back and wait for more information about shootings or until it was certain the shooter had killed himself. In this interval, many people have died.<br /><br />If there is a burglary in your house and the police are called, they will not rush in with guns drawn to confront the thieves. What they will do depends on the situation and the procedures under which they operate in their department. Most likely, they will stand outside and put officers at the front and back of the house to watch who emerges. (None of this, by the way, should be interpreted to detract in anyway from the bravery of those who do face deadly dangers in carrying out their jobs.) In many parts of the western states, dialing 911 would not bring any assistance in time to do any good. In cities, there is no help if someone comes in and attacks you.<br /><br />It is quite true, despite all of this, that guns in the house are more of a danger to the occupants than to criminals. They provide an quick path to suicide, accident or one family member shooting another.<br /><br />I believe the attachment to guns by many rests on a false sense of power. All around us, corporations, the state, employers and others impose on and take away power from the individual. A gun represents a means of self assertion and independence, whether misdirected or not. By the way, there might be no good need for a 31 shot clip, but a one or two shot clip would render a gun totally useless in any situation.<br /><br />This is a losing issue for Democrats. If you want to seat another 30 to 40 House seats go Republican, then push gun control. We need to build a consensus first and vote later. No one wanted seat belts and later air bags when they came around, but now we know both have saved many lives. We can slow and stop gun violence by a concerted, organized national effort. So far, we have barely started on such a campaign.<br /><br />Doug Terry at The TerryReport", "recommendationCount": 11}, {"assetID": 2296360, "replies": [], "lft": 358, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/us/14guns.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3230996, "rgt": 359, "userDisplayName": "jonschoon", "createDate": "1294979425", "userID": 31232555, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294985018", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Diego", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294985018", "commentSequence": 87, "commentBody": "This is all pretty interesting.

In fact I will state their very actions only worsened their lot.<br /><br />In fact I will also state that all too many so called communist liberation groups proved once in power to be far more dictatorial than those they displaced however bloody they may have been. In fact I will also note that the aggregate death toll inflicted by communist states on their own citizens in the twentieth century exceeds that inflicted by fascist states. Those like Lori Berenson who romanticize and choose to participate in the bloody and atrocity laden conflict caused by so called liberators are not worthy of any respect or sympathy when they finally have to face he consequences of their actions. Lori Berenson choose her path, and now she should accept and face the consequences of her actions. She also owes an apology for her role in aiding and abetting Sendero Luminoso's bloody attacks to those who were victims of them.

Finally, the only way to complete a cycle is to connect (2,1) with (2,2), and (3,1) with (3,2).<br /><br />The proof is a bit complicated especially when I can only use words. Of course, that is what a rigorous proof should be, using only symbols (words), a la Hilbert program.<br /><br />Like the proof for C_1 being the shortest cycle I alluded to Hans #11, it requires a classification of all possible patterns of the neighbouring edges (the straight lace segments going in and out of) of two vertices (eyelets) on the same side of the shoe.

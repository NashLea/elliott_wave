For example, women in North America shave their legs, armpits and upper lip to \"look feminine\", but women in some European cultures do not have to shave their body hair to be considered \"feminine\".  Similarly, having a strong, muscular physique has nothing to do with what is is biologically natural for women, but everything to do with convincing women that they should look soft and weak to be \"feminine\". A woman can stop menstruating temporarily for a variety of reasons and that is natural too since her body is not designed to give birth continuously from puberty to menopause.

The officer once explained to me that deciding that a soldier deserves a medal and writing a citation that will actually get approved are two entirely different matters, and he noted that the majority of his submissions were rejected or sent back with suggestions for re-wording. <br/><br/>In discussions with my friends, I was surprised to learn that we all tended to regard certain medals as, essentially, lifetime achievement awards even though they are always actually awarded for a specific incident. I think that reflects the officer's dilemma in some respects. <br/><br/>Lastly, we all agreed that on the telegram home one is always 'slightly' wounded but that on the medal citation one is always 'seriously' wounded.

I have a tweener from China, and especially given the doubts a number of Chinese adults we know have expressed about her official finding story, I would have searched.  I did a lot of initial info-gathering when she was young in preparation for the day.  The day not only has not come, but as she gets older, she emphatically made her opposition to searching very clear.  I've tried to offer a balanced view of the issues, and she articulately tells me why her dad and I are wrong.  I too believe there are many decisions that are the parent's to make and cannot be left to a child.  She has had no choice but to have a flu shot every year, attend the schools we've selected for her, see the orthodontist, do her homework, and get to bed on time.

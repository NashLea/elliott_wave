Jeff Huggins:   Lesson #1:  Most journalists are not very good at science.   Journalism school does not require the Engineering and Science Core Curriculum [E&amp;S CC], nor does it require any course which relies on the E&amp;S CC.   Neither Edward R. Murrow nor Walter Cronkite knew anything about it.   The E&amp;S CC depends on and starts with  freshman and sophomore calculus.   The E&amp;S CC is \"math heavy.\"   A reporter who doesn't know the math is like a blind person at a movie.   In addition to the E&amp;S CC, you also need a laboratory course in probability and statistics and a course in computer programming.

Prohibition was heavily supported by the likes John D. Rockefeller (of Standard Oil fame). Why? Because the Ford Motor Company was hot on the trail of ethanol powered vehicles. Ethanol is alcohol too, remember. Prohibition may have failed to stamp out alcoholism, but it did succeed in perpetuating our other well known addiction to oil.<br /><br />I raise this factoid to illustrate the power that the petrochemical industry once had and continues to have on our world. Someday when we are long out of the current mess, I believe that historians will paint the history of our time (9/11 and its aftermath) as a global proxy war fueled by petrochemical interests and waged against any government making a concerted attempt to wean its economy away from petrochemicals. Who are the John D. Rockefellers of today and what is their current strategy? I'll let Mr. Mead and the historians figure that one out, but I'll give you my hunch: the War On Terror is a big part of the reason why we haven't been able to make any progress on energy and environmental policy. Who can think about anything else when so many of our resources are being poured into that cauldron? If this is so, then we cannot get a comprehensive energy and environmental policy until the War on Terror is over and as long as there is a War on Terror we won't have a comprehensive e-e policy.<br /><br />The implications of this are harrowing because it means that some sectors of our society, and indeed of the global society at large, may have an incentive to prolong the WOT as long as possible. It also means that every self-immolating fanatic anywhere in the world has the power to prolong our current state of global inertia (if we let them). On the bright side, this could also mean that if we were somehow able to legislate a comprehensive e-e policy moving us away from petrochems then the end of the WOT would be imminent as a result of our unilateral declaration of victory over the John D. Rockefellers, whoever they might be, whatever language they speak, and whatever Gods they pray to.

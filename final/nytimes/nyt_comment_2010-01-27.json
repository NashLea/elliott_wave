One of the entitlement programs that presumably might be cut is Social Security.  The Social Security Trust Fund is being used to fund other items in the budget; that is why there are concerns about the future funding of Social Security.  Most people who get Social Security receive a relatively small amount of money.  Perhaps some people don't realize that some Social Security benefits (on the high end) are taxed. I am receiving a very miniscule amount of Social Security because most of my jobs were in the public schools and we were not part of the Social Security System.  My credits come from other, earlier jobs. Instead, we paid into a pension system. Those of us who have what is considered a higher income (and it is less than $250,00) are being asked to pay more for Medicare than the rest of the population.  Since I can afford to pay the surtax, I do not mind.  However, the general population of the U.S. should know that this is happening already.  I believe that we should cut back on unnecessary weapons and non-productive programs, not on job-creating or life-sustaining programs. During the Great Depression, it took spending to begin to create jobs.  It would be better to spend to create jobs, than to spend on unemployment insurance.  Thomas Friedman of the NY Times suggested yesterday that we have an entrepreneur program to create small and creative businesses.  This sounds like an excellent idea.

Outright free agency has driven up player salaries (and rightly so) and those costs have to be met somehow.<br /><br />It's nice hearing all the nostalgic stories from back in the day when a game ticket cost $5 and a hot dog 10cents, but Johnny U. maxed out at about $75k a year (I believe) so those memories belong somewhere etched in sepia... they really have no bearing on the economics of today.  As Giants fans we want the team to sign productive players... well productive players (unless you get lucky in the draft) come at a premium... IOUs don't cut it, and unlike the Yankees, the Maras don't print money.<br /><br />Now I fully understand the sense of disconnect many are feeling, and can appreciate the sense of betrayal as well... but business is business.  If the team can compete financially then pretty soon they'll stop being competitive on the field as well... then we'll all be complaining.

TV contracts, gate receipts, merchandizing can only recoup but so much.  Right here in the NFC East we have two of the most aggressive marketers of their teams in Dan Snyder and Jerry Jones.  Their personnel decisions haven't always panned out, but take a look at their payroll and overall net worth... compare that to the Giants.  We are middle top in terms of team value which means our pocketbook is smaller than our rivals.  To be competitive you have to play by modern rules.  Let the fat cats go freeze in the cold or sit in their skyboxes.

This is no ordinary bed and breakfast, its walls feature contemporary Indian art, the furniture is elegant and the rooms, which are located over 3 levels are comfortable, the bathrooms stylish. There is a wonderful terrace at the top where you can relax with a beer and take a detached look at the traffic and to the park beyond. I stayed with my daughter over 4 nights and we immediately felt at home not only because of the wonderful ambiance but mainly because we were welcomed by Atul and Sheetal personally. They make time to get to know each guest and then make sure that they and their staff look after their needs and answer all their questions. We were really sad to leave, and hope to get back one day. We would recommend Thikana to any travellers who wish to enjoy a sophisticated relaxing environment, enjoy good conversation with Atul and the other guests, and friendly service from the staff. It was a joy to meet them and stay there.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1099692, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/restaurants/1247466736327/le-caprice/details.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2439874, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1264574884", "userID": 53686182, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "Wake up, Please!", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264574884", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264735337", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "As i started reading this article, I was hoping for the best, but reality gripped my better conciousness.

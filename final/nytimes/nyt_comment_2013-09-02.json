A 20/50 pension plan had been put in place a few years after a transit strike in the mid-1960s. The immediate retirement of thousands of the most skilled workers, followed by the soaring costs of workers receiving one or more years in retirement for each year worked, was a key factor in the financial and physical collapse of New York City's transit system in the 1970s.[citation needed] By 1980, a less generous 25/55 pension had been imposed on new workers by the state legislature. By the time of the strike, the financial damage from the 20/50 pension plan had abated, because most of those who benefitted had retired with their pensions funded, but those hired under the 25/55 plan were approaching the age at which those who preceded them had recently retired.\""}]}, "lft": 316, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/opinion/krugman-love-for-labor-lost.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9876806, "rgt": 323, "userDisplayName": "David Underwood", "createDate": "1378094446", "userID": 53612425, "replyCount": 3, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1378094467", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Citrus Heights", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1378090867", "commentSequence": 41, "commentBody": "I spent most of my working years as a member of a union.

We and Russia have so much in common! Compared to other advanced nations, the US worker is treated like an updated version of an abused Russian peasant--in worker benefits, health care, education, retirement--the whole 9 yards. BTW, both US &amp; Russia freed their slaves/serfs in the mid 1860s. Of course their serfs were the same race as their owners and not brought from Africa. <br/><br/>Also, we and Soviet Union were the 2 opposite poles &amp; rivals in the Cold War. After Communism fell, their wealthy oligarchs took over. Our US oligarch enablers such as Larry Summers--later a designer of our 08 crash and Obama advisor-- went to Russia and helped push quick and dirty capitalism and privatization there. That led to widespread downward spirals in health and livelihoods of Russian and Lithuanian populations. Many suicides occurred  and male life expectancy fell sharply. <br/><br/>Our own oligarch wealth/power has been enlarged by the same team who started Russia's downward slide. The wealth of our 1% has soared astronomically. Workers salaries plunged. Per the Times, US health across all economic classes is worse than in past decades, and compared to other advanced nations. <br/><br/>On this Labor Day, how ironic that Obama may pick Summers for fed chairman.

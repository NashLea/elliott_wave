No interest in it. No talent for it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it. Didn't matter. I wouldn't have studied it had that decision been left up to me, but it wasn't. I was ordered to do it, on pain of expulsion. Had I been expelled all Hell would have broken out at home. When studying French became so overwhelmingly awful I did everything that I could to lessen the burden. So, occasionally, I cheated. And after I did I hated French even more than before; if such a thing were possible.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I loved electronics. Electronics fascinated me. My eyes were glued to books about that subject. It filled me with wonder. So I never cheated; not once. No need. In fact, it never crossed my mind. It never occurred to me.<br/><br/>Another difference between them: knowledge of French (or another foreign language) was required to graduate and receive a certificate. We were there to earn that certificate. Electronics wasn't even offered, although it was far more practical and useful, because the school's administration wasn't interested and it didn't want to hire anyone to teach it.

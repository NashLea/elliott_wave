These are further exacerbated by the failure of many citizens, including many commenting on this article, to realize what is actually in the Obamacare legislative package.  Not very many people, including me, have read it.  Let me expose some of these myths based on what I have read:<br /><br />1.  There is a false  perception that 40 million uninsured US citizens receive no health care.  A portion of these can afford insurance but elect to self insure and pay for their medical services.<br />There are free medical services in all major cities for those below a certain income level.  (For example, In Atlanta anyone can go to Grady Memorial were services are free for anyone up to 3 times the poverty level.  For a couple with two children, this income cap is over $60,000 and nobody is checking.  You can even be here illegally and qualify!  Fulton county, where I live, pays Grady $40 million a year for this service.  No one is suggesting that this goes away under Obamacare.)  There are undoubtedly needy people who need help but it is nowhere near the 40 million number.<br /><br />2.  People, including illegal aliens in some states, under the poverty level qualify for Medicaid.  Medicaid costs on average $7,500 per recipient per year split between the states and the federal government.  Yet Obamacare forecasts less than half this amount is required for the uninsured program.  If Obamacare can do it for this much less, why not start with the 40 million Medicaid recipients where we are already spending over $300 billion per year and have a administrative staff in place?<br /><br />3.  Obamacare presumes that all 40 million uninsured will sign up.  After all, their cost is limited to 8% of thetir  income, Uncle Sam pays the rest.   Also, they will have to pay $750 pr year if they do not sign up and get nothing.  Wait, a minute.  If a person makes $20,000 per year they will have to spend $1,600 for coverage versus paying $750 for nothing.  If they make more, the impact is worse.  Why won't they wait until they really need it?  They can then go to Grady or sign up since there is no denial for a preexisting condition.<br /><br />4.  Obamacare is self funded as reflected by the Congressional budget office.  First, the Congressional budget office is not allowed to question any assumptions or develop any anternative projections.  They simply verify the numbers based on the assumptions provided.<br />Obamacare projects less than half the current costs per recipient for any other federal health care program over a future 10 year period.  Historic health care inflation rates are over 6% per year on average.  This is not feasible.<br /><br />There is a real need for reform in the current health care system.  We should separate the reforms from covering the uninsured and focus on real numbers and feasible improvements.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2094427, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/england/cambridge/attractions.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3118146, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1290402925", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290402925", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "userSuggestion", "updateDate": "1290479304", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "A trip to the \"Wembley of the Fens\" - The Traderecruitment Stadium - a.k.a.

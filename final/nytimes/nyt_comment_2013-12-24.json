Taking your two Neo-Keynesian post together, three things occur to me:  First, Neo-Keynesians, unlike monetarist and austerians, by virtue of Keynes, the IS-LM curve, James Tobin, and recent work by you, DeLong, et al. have a consistent Neo-Keynesian macroeconomic theory that works both inside and outside a liquidity trap.  Following Tobin and the implications of whether the real interest rate is negative or positive, Neo-Keynesians can produce a set of policy prescription that remedy what ails an economy:  Mostly, monetary stimulus without any fiscal contraction during normal recessions with a positive real interest rate; and robust fiscal and monetary stimulus, when demand falls so low that, to restore full employment, the real interest rate is negative, which requires robust and sufficient fiscal stimulus to correct.<br/><br/>Congrats to you all; that is great work.<br/><br/>However, actors' rational micro expectations are, I think, very different inside a liquidity trap than they are outside of it.  Outside of it, actors believe that monetary stimulus will be sufficient to restore the economy to full employment, and thus continue to invest and will quickly rehire workers.  But, in a liquidity trap, actors don't expect and can see monetary stimulus alone won't work and thus won't invest to expand output, nor will they rehire workers.

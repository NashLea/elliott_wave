The morality that survives and propagates is to a first approximation the morality of the culture that prevails. This can have unpleasant human consequences. An early agricultural society that practiced slavery, for example, the most efficient economic organization of that time, typically prevailed over egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies.

Sadly, it is true that many (approximately 40%) of students that we see today cannot do the mathematics on the PARCC test when they enter college.  I attribute this to the fact that -- before common core standard -- students only needed to get 35% of the questions correct on the Math A (Algebra I) Regents exam to \"pass\" the exam (i.e., earn a 60).

They are asking for parents in those schools to speak out about these high-stakes. My daughter is in school in Philadelphia.

At least here in Montclair, there are zero stakes.  A 10 point quiz counts for more to a student.  But calling these \"high stakes\" fits the narrative, which is intended to frighten parents.<br/><br/>Just last week, an employee of our school district called my wife's statement at a Board of Ed meeting \"pathetic\".  One of our sons had been greatly inspired by his language arts teacher in one of our elementary schools, and he ended up writing a book.  But praising this teacher's creativity, and expressing gratitude for how she encouraged our son's own creativity, breaks the narrative of fear.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, fear is easy to inspire in us parents; we care so much for our children.  More: for years I've heard other parents lamenting their inability to help their children with math homework.  I took that as a positive sign: math education is improving.  Now, however, those same parents are judging what a math test should or should not include.  That threatens to set a cap on what we can teach our kids: what we learned, and no more.  The same way we learned, and no different.  This leaves no room for improvement in what is taught or how it is taught.<br/><br/>I believe we should strive for precisely the opposite.  I believe that my job as a parent - and the job of our schools - is achieved when our children surpass us.

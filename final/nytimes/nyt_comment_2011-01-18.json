Anecdotally, one of my dogs had a pair of sunglasses; the first time he wore them, he had the expected doggy reaction and flipped them off. This continued until he saw his reflection in a shop window, then his body language became: \"hmmm...\", \"cool...\", \"really scary\".  And yes, I would say that he did recognize the shop window as a mirror since, when young, he would tense into a guard position at his reflection but with experience, he would ignore these mirrors.<br /><br />Similarly, with language, the assumption is that language is both human and vocal. But dogs are pack animals who communicate by a combination of \"body language\", \"scent marking\" and \"dance\" with vocal communication being very low on the list. Part of the job of handling guard dogs is being able to read this \"doggy language\", and again anecdotally, when one of my dogs was separated from the rest of the team for a solo adventure I would be able to follow much of the \"doggy conversation\" on our return.<br /><br />Another relevant anecdote is that dogs tell fibs; when we would return from a visit to the vets, the brave guard dog fearlessly standing up to the sadistic veterinarian as recounted to the rest of the pack was pure fantasy.<br /><br />Finally, my last word on the sunglasses: In his old age,the guard dog who wore the sunglasses would spend many hours at the beach with slightly damp fur sitting on a high rock exposed to the \"Mistral\" contentedly waring his sunglasses.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 2308316, "replies": [], "lft": 370, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/science/18dog.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3247165, "rgt": 371, "userDisplayName": "sky96", "createDate": "1295325775", "userID": 31068045, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295329638", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Francisco", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295329638", "commentSequence": 140, "commentBody": "I wonder how well humans would do if Chaser \"barked\" the same commands to us?

I try to share with friends and family the intelligence of my Australian Shepherd, a herding dog similar to the Border Collie.

The friend laughed about the detail of it; I had written down the commands that Toko knew at that point - which turned out to be about 200 then.<br /><br />Over the nine years since, Toko's understanding and interaction with me verbally has increased but most interesting is that she keeps changing and improving the way SHE communicates with me.  She develops - without any input from me - different whines and murmurs and barks for the different things she needs.  I am trained and continuously receive updated training by her. She is a fantastically brilliant and loving companion.<br /><br />Aussies are working dogs who need jobs and physical activity but I would say that they are a bit less intense and physically demanding than the Border Collie.  Mine seems to make up for having a suburban life (she does get to play frisbee, go skiing and boating, etc.) by honing her intellectual skills.<br /><br />Certainly our pets, other domesticated animals and wild animals have great intelligence that we do not often give them credit for.

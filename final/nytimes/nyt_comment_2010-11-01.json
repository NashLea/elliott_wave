It never gets old and I never run out of players.<br /><br />A dermatologist once told me that we don't need to use soap everyday, because it does dry the skin.  He suggested that every other day I just rinse in water, and that, not too hot.  So that's what I do. I was also told by my GYN that certain soaps are too harsh for those certain parts, and that water is best, followed by mild, fragrance-free soaps (Cetaphil, for example).  Sometimes I'll rinse twice a day, depending on the weather and my activity.  Showers don't have to be long, you can have a good rinse in 3 minutes or less and still come out fresh and clean.  As far as I'm concerned, everyone should wear at least a deodorant, if not a full antiperspirant, at least in NYC!<br /><br />The only time I don't bathe is when I know I'm going to be in my own company and environment for that day.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2016162, "replies": [], "lft": 514, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/fashion/31Unwashed.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2770478, "rgt": 515, "userDisplayName": "Hentrain Mansbury", "createDate": "1288580536", "userID": 40231213, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1288585418", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Woodside, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1288581818", "commentSequence": 230, "commentBody": "I think there's a huge natural variation in how stinky different people can get.

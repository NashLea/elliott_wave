What NYT, unfortunately, failed to mention is that this national guard battalion is subordinated to the Ministry of Interior that is to Minister Avakov himself. <br/><br/>The issue of decentralization is obfuscated as a demand of Putin and a concession to Russia. In fact, the Minsk 2 agreement was mediated by Hollande and Merkel and in their recent meeting with Poroshenko in Berlin (August 24) they insisted that decentralization be implemented. Moreover, in his speech at Rada the head of the ruling party, Mr. Lutsenko, stated today that decentralization was one of the demands of the Maidan. Mr. Saakashvili, governor of the Odessa oblast, too, supported the decentralization and even revoked the free cities under the Magdeburg law in the Middle Ages. By insisting that this was a concession to the Kremlin with a gun to his head in Debaltsevo, NYT further confuses its readership.

At least that's what I think, I don't wear makeup everyday but when I do, I do it because I feel like it and want to do awesome effect with it. So far I've done some pretty epic things with it, even made myself look like a man one time for a show. Not to say there aren't women out there that believe that makeup makes them beautiful, there are women like that... but those women are the ones you should be apologizing to because they are the ones that have been oppressed, because none of the women here seem to believe that men are the sole reason to why were wear makeup. That's just plain arrogant...<br /><br />I'm also younger than Michelle, college student really. -High-fives Heather-<br /><br />Anyway, nice look Michelle for some reason it reminds me of Mirrors Edge.

I guess not. Guess what? She is no different from other kinds of artists. It's just that instead of paper or canvas, she decided to use her face. Why is it that her art judged differently from other artists who paint on canvasses and papers? Yes, you have to erase it afterwards, but why does that small differences make her not qualified for being a true artist? She's a MAKE UP ARTIST, not some girl who hides her identity like your accusation in your comment. You saw her face without make up, and if you see her other videos, you would lost count on how many times she uploaded videos containing a scene of herself without any make up on. Now, a girl who painted her face to hide her identity wouldn't dare to do so, would she?<br /><br />Everyone do most of the things in their lives to make themselves feel good. There's nothing wrong about feeling good, is there? Even you, expressing your opinion is an act to make yourself feel good, whether you realize it or not. You know that people, \"feminists\" might retaliate to your comment, but do you care? It's the same behaviour women have about make up. If we really care about what you might think if us, none of us would wear make up anymore, because I have seen a heckload lot of guys with the same opinion as you. Does that ever stop us from buying and wearing cosmetic? Nope, because make up does make women feel good. That's the truth, and I dont see anything shallow or wrong with it.<br /><br />You relate make up as a tool of vanity, to cover insecurities. Guess what? I hate to break it down to you, but no one can run from insecurities and vanity. Not even you. Everyone has their own little things, it's inevitable. And if you said that you don't have anything you're insecure about, not one bit, you are lying, and that shows that you actually have bigger insecurities than half of the women who constantly watched make up tutorial videos. It's okay to be insecure sometimes, you're human, and as long as it doesn't get the best of you, insecurity is good to remind us that we have to keep trying to be a better person in life. It makes us go forward.<br /><br />You said that make up is a form of oppression. Women wear make up to \"attract mate\", \"increase social status\", and feel good about themselves. Have you ever think of it this way: You are idealising women by saying that women who are confident, smart and already have a certain degree of social status are the women who dont wear make up. Isn't it some kind of oppression that you single-handedly drop upon us women?<br /><br />Now, let's compare to the older era where women were treated like some kind of pretty object. Men expected women to always be pretty, obedient, to say only good and pretty stuff, and to smile and greeted them with a cup of coffee everyday. If you don't realize it already, I'm telling you that what you're doing is the same as what those sexist men did in the older days, the difference is that, men in the older days imposed and shaped their ideal women to be a pretty doll who were obedient and could take care of their house chores, and you imposed and shaped your ideal women as the one who don't wear make up.<br /><br />This makes me wonder; how many smart, amazing and confident women have passed from your life just because you saw them in bright red lipstick and Marilyn Monroe make up she decided to try on after watching her movie rerun the other night?<br /><br />Do you respect women? Of course, your answer is YES. You respect women. But sometimes I doubt that answer when it came from people like you, pigeon holing women according to their appearances. If you respect women as a whole, you would respect her when she decided that she wanted to be a little crazy today, and slap on some thick, vintage inspired make up as well as you respect her when she's not wearing her make up. That is called respecting a person for what she is, instead of go around and judging her based on her make up.<br /><br />Try talking with some girls without judging them first. You wouldn't know if she was a smart, interesting person if you didn't talk to her. The saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\" doesn't always go to someone who wears shabby clothes, but also towards certain stereotypes/pigeon holes. If you stick to your stereotyping, judgmental manner, I'm afraid you have passed up a lot of chances to meet different kinds of interesting people and to broaden your views.<br /><br />I hope that this goes into a consideration to a lot of men who think like JCM there.

And if the actual value added to society each year (productivity increase of 1% even in slow years) is illusionary, which I would agree with, it doesn't negate the necessity of fighting for a fair share of the increase.<br/>2) Krugman previously stated only 5% of the 15% decrease in manufacturing (meaning drops from 30% share of GDP to 15%) can be attributed to global imports while ignoring the larger implication of globalization.  Exporting manufacturing also creates incentives to decrease all manufacturing.  There is also a dialectic or spiral, people lack jobs and money to buy stuff so less stuff is made. Companies learn less manufacturing is better.  Make money in finance, no headaches from unions, suppliers, inventory management. The only good worker is a low paid worker.   What if all iphones were made entirely in the U.S, and cost $1,000 instead of $600 and the workers were paid $50/hour and everyone's income for the bottom 80% were paid $1/hour more than they are now? That's $2,000/year more so same number of iphones are sold, plus another $1,600 of manufactured goods.

Skinny kids are perceived as being under fed. All kids and teens need to be fed balanced healthy meals and snacks. A doctor I recently met said to watch portions and strive for half of the dinner plate filled with fruits and vegetables and ease off the white bread and white rice and choose whole grains and brown rice. Portions are out of control at restaurants and kids' meals (chicken nuggets/fries, pizza, butter noodles, mac/cheese) at restaurants are pathetic at best. School lunches are dismal and need an overhaul, even the ones packed at home. After-school snacks need to be healthy and convenient. Some public schools in my area have a healthy-eating curriculum sponsored by a local hospital that has dietitians train parents to give mini-lessons in class about healthy food choices. A food tasting is included in the lesson.

Last night many were raped, or beaten, or carjacked but do we worry about that? How many children were sodomized or raped last night? Probably in the thousands. Do we worry about that. No, sadly we don't.  The gun issue is a fear of who will do the policing. I for one do not want Hillary Clinton, or George Soros, or Al Gore making that determination for me. The left has shown that they cannot be trusted to do anything right. They have created this problem by educating a world of self centered narcissists. When they grow up and realize that they are not the center of the universe they have no God to turn to, no family support, and the government is a poor substitute for both. They too often explode.

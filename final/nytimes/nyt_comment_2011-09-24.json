It now goes unrecognized but may be one of the best political speech's in many years.  The audience was largely present and appeared to be intent on what he had to say.  And, as clear as anyone could make it, he fairly presented the many obstacles that lie in the path to peace.  I have never particularly liked the Prime Minister.  However, he was given his chance and accurately described the history of peace attempts in the area.  He presented the actual bona fide concerns of Israel in an unfiltered light.  And he made clear that peace can only be expected to occur when those concerns are addressed which so far they have not been.  He also made clear that he was swallowing his long term aspirations for the expansion of the territory of Israel and offered to give those up  in exchange for real peace.  It is a game changer!  That, along side the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people that we saw today can lead to a partnership of these people's in the cradle of Western civilization and pave the way for the resolution of this 63 year war.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3270536, "replies": [], "lft": 1286, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/world/palestinians-submit-statehood-bid-at-un.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4579144, "rgt": 1287, "userDisplayName": "Sarat Pattanayak", "createDate": "1316836913", "userID": 60019981, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1316838406", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "India", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1316834806", "commentSequence": 346, "commentBody": "One thing is crystal clear: the US is permanently in Israel\u2019s headlock.

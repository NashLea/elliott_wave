That's what seems to be missing from the debate.<br /><br />We're supposed to accept as an unquestioned postulate the TSA's claims that what they do is effective and necessary. But the only evidence they can offer is \"that's classified, so trust us.\" Unfortunately, the TSA has given us little if any reason to trust them.<br /><br />As even Administrator Pistole admits, the scanners are \"invasive,\" and the alternative pat down is even more so (even when it's not being used as a punitive measure to \"encourage\" passengers to choose the scanner). The scanners carry a high cost, in liberties, privacy, and dignity as well as dollars. The scanners also carry some risk of cumulative radiation exposure that's probably small but it is there. That risk is increased because of the opacity of the operating and maintenance procedures that make it impossible to be sure the TSA is operating and maintaining the machines correctly.<br /><br />The question, then, is whether the benefit justifies the cost and risks. Unfortunately the answer is not forthcoming, again because of the TSA's fetish for secrecy. We're presumably supposed to accept that the benefit justifies the cost and risks based on trust and faith in the TSA. Many people may have had faith and trust in the TSA up until now, based perhaps on a fervent desire for the government to protect us. But I think the combination of unprecedented intrusiveness and the contemptuous way the TSA has chosen to roll out these \"enhancements\" has caused an increasing number of people to finally lose faith and trust. Thus the backlash we're now seeing.<br /><br />Pistole's claims that the \"invasive\" strip search or pat down are absolutely necessary and justified by current threats may be honest and accurate. But given the TSA's unfortunate reputation, I don't think we should just quietly accept a costly, invasive, uncomfortable security measure just because the agency's leader took time away from his busy schedule to tell us to accept it.<br /><br />It really is time to subject the TSA to a thorough independent review and cost-benefit analysis, to make sure we're actually getting something for what their \"security\" is costing us.

As a developer he will be no friend of tenants either. The reporter calls him a bully, but remember that Eliot Spitzer called himself a [expletive deleted] steamroller and look how that turned out. Both cheated on their wives, so that's a wash. And Spitzer's father is a developer too, only the Spitzers are downstaters and Paladino is an upstater.<br /><br />It's the same old New York State political scene, downstate and cities vs. upstate and suburbs, and the election will be much closer than any of us would care to think. My guess is that those awful new ballot scanners will serve Paladino well as they jam and break and cause city Democrats to walk away from long lines at the polls without casting votes for Cuomo. I fear that Paladino voters, anti-incumbent and sharing their man's rage, will succeed in electing their candidate.<br /><br />This is just not the Democrats' year, for a number of reasons. Since Cuomo is an incumbent and Paladino isn't, the rage guy just may make it into the governor's mansion in spite of himself.<br /><br />Oh, how I wish NYC would just secede from the state and be done with it!

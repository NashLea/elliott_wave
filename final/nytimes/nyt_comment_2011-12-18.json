But here Mr. Douthat is raising him from the dead as virtual Christian.   It's a nice job of attempting to sell Hitchens post posthumously to certain hard boiled Christians, but it would seem to be a disservice, perhaps even dishonoring the memory of Christians, who never sought such cover.<br/><br/>Mature, established and more liberal minded Christains have no problem with atheists, like Hitchens, who are making a good faith (no pun intended) attempt at seeking the truth.  In this vein of Christianity, it is understood that each person follows a unique path to finding God.  Here they need to merely point to C.S. Lewis. <br/><br/>The intolerant Christians (an oxymoron if there ever was one), Christians that rely more on the old testament than the new to manifest hate and intolerance,  these are the ones that normally would attack Hitchens, but in the last quarter of Hitchens life, while he never came to religion, he did come to this brand of Christianities politics - most decidedly after 9/11 Hitchens found himself a conservative.<br/><br/>I'm incline to believe that this was a strategic move by Hitchens. Vehemently anti-religion, I'm incline to believe that though Hitchens thought all religion to be dangerous to enlightenment, he saw Islam as the religious movement that was the greatest threat to the enlightenment, and thus decided to form a political alliance with the right, including Christians on the right, in opposing fundamentalist-militant Islam.", "recommendationCount": 23}, {"assetID": 3296230, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 5090316, "replies": [], "commentID": 5091026, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "albertcscs", "createDate": "1324210380", "userID": 35353258, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1324223953", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "beethy", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Vina del Mar Chile", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1324223953", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Right on beethy!

The college provides a \"parent educator\" that helps parents with the ins and outs of running a self contained and legal preschool while also teaching the latest in early childhood development. The college requires caregivers to comply with a clearly defined set of rules. Other than that, the coops have their own board of directors and make their own agreements. All caregivers are required to work about 10 hours a week - I'm the treasurer for our coop and handle pretty much all the legalities of the organization, and yes it's complex with a lot of red tape, but this model of pre-school has been around Seattle for decades now, and there is lots of help from the college. As for the curricula, each coop hires well qualified and enthusiastic teachers who are cutting edge in the latest early childhood development. The coop program goes on for four years - each year the child attending more days and hours while the caregivers step back and allow the children to experience more autonomy. The cost comes out to be about $500 for one half day per week for the 9 month session and rises as the children attend more days and hours.

I had heard about the collection and Lincoln University's involvement several years before in an NPR story. Even though my father (and four uncles) are LU alumni, I had never heard that Lincoln University held the majority on the Board of Trustees. Dad would bring us back to campus yearly for a reunion and commencement. From the film, I thought it unfair for the state to actively intercede to break the Dr. Barnes' Indenture of Trust.  I also felt that Lincoln had been strong-armed by the state of Pennsylvania. I also thought that LU was foolish for selling their majority position on the Board to Big Charity for cents on the dollar.<br/><br/>Then I went to Merion and saw the collection. Actually, I saw a little less than half the collection since the second floor has already been closed for conservation and shipping to Philadelphia! The canvasses are magnificent. Within the space of a few rooms I saw Renoir's progression from a portraitist to grand works that are alive with color and light to very blurred depictions where the color is pretty much all there is...figures in the foreground and background barely discernable. The placement of the art work with the wrought iron and silver pieces (hinges, locks, keys, etc.) and furniture of the collection make for a real experience. I loved my time there. However, somewhere between halfway and 3/4 the way through my tour, I realized that if the collection isn't moved to a new location, isn't exploited and sold more effectively, it will cease to exist. <br/><br/>The collection's current location can't drive enough eyeballs past it to carry its own freight. Breaking his wishes is a shame yet a testament to Dr. Barnes' aesthetic senses. In one-hundred years, much of the collection could be in terminal disrepair and some pieces would need to be sold in order to save the others. I wish it were different but in order for it to exist as a single collection forever, The Barnes has to move. Darnit! <br/><br/>I didn't relish listening to the gift shop person pontificate on how the Foundation is anxious for the move and that they all disagree with the documentary's premise...Well, yeah...once you stack the Board with folks that will vote your way you sort of get what you want, don't you? <br/><br/>I disagree with those who say that the art is being held hostage in Merion. The art isn't being held hostage. Your own attitude is holding you hostage. Anyone who wants to see the collection at the North Latches Lane location before it moves to Philly proper, I recommend they find time to do so. Just don't wait too long.  I plan to see it once or twice more before it moves. And I will definitely see it at the new location, too.

While Manhola is correct to say that the rest of the movie can't live up to the opening, it's not because the movie isn't terrific.  It's simply because the opening twelve minutes of this film are among the best sequences of cinema I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.\r<br/><br/>The filmmakes take you through all of human emotion in those 12 minutes.  From puppy love to aged emotion.  From optimism to devastation.  Surely, the films core audience will be too young to get the meaning of images like Carl sitting outside of the hospital room, but for the adult in the audience there will be fewer images made more powerful.  Pulled apart as it's own short film, that opening itself would be worth the price of admission.  A beautifully rendered love story that will make your heart swell.\r<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, I never stopped smiling.  The talking dogs.  The lanky bird.  Even the portly boy scout.  All of these characters come together to keep you on the edge of your seat.  \r<br/><br/>A wonderful film.

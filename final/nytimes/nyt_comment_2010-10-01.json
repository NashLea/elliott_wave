A few weeks into my first semester my roommate wrote me a rambling coming out letter and challenged me to live up to my so called principles by remaining in the room with him and not requesting a room change.  He declared that he was \"coming out on the dorm floor\" and wanted me to have a heads up in case I was chicken.  It was 1983 and I will admit that I thought about it for a couple of hours and I worried about the consequences of living with a gay roommate.  I was pissed to be put in that position.  However I'm a stubborn bastard and I decided to hang in there with him.  Ego is something.  Implicit in my decision to stay in that room was a decision to be loyal to my roommate no matter what happened.  Believe me we got to be friends, but we had conflicts just like any other freshman college roommates.  But if anyone messed with him I would have fought the whole damn floor if necessary.  He was MY roommate.  I took a little light ribbing from some buddies in the beginning, not much, and than things just went back to normal after they saw that I was serious about staying in there.  As a result I got to know what was at that time a true subculture and learned to empathize with the hundreds of gay students who I met through my roommate.  Thanks to my roommate's courage (not many people were coming out than) my buddies on the floor got to know an \"out\" gay person.  Nobody ever gave him crap at all.  Not once.<br /><br />My beef with this guy Ravi is that he is disloyal, cruel, and a coward.  He should have requested another roommate if he had a problem living with a gay student.  I can't believe that this crap is still happening and I can't believe how gutless and cruel people have become.  Courage and loyalty are learned habits that have to be practiced every day.

Why should these sites get rich off advertising money using information they didn't pay us for, and didn't even obtain our consent to use?  Why should these sites get fat and happy on the backs of our wholesale loss of privacy?<br /><br />I recently discovered a Facebook page for my (beloved) old sleep-away camp where various Facebook members had, without my knowledge or consent, uploaded photos taken of me in the 1970s when I was as young as 9 years old.  My own photos were pretty tame, but it was a breach of my privacy nonetheless.  And there were photos posted of other campers sharing a first kiss, mooning, streaking and so on.  I'm sure no one obtained consents from those former campers any more than they'd obtained consents from me.  I contacted the administrator and demanded that he remove the portions of any photos that depicted me; I'm still waiting for a result.<br /><br />These were photos taken in public, and, yes, we (generally) all knew our photos were being taken, but in 1978 no one had the slightest conception that one day our images could be disseminated instantaneously worldwide, that anyone who saw the photos could instantaneously download a copy, and that therefore the images, once released, could never be erased.<br /><br />Similarly, all those Yearbook sites -- include my hometown's website -- upload photos that were never intended for permanent worldwide distribution, and the consent to publication of the image was far, far more circumscribed.  Why should these Yearbook sites be able to make tons of advertising money off of *our* images, which they use *without out consent*??<br /><br />What, do even those of us who NEVER use Twitter or social networking sites, now have to worry about the retroactive exposure of a lifetime's worth of photos, video and words created decades ago now being uploaded to the web?<br /><br />If the consent requirement has the impact of making these sites commercially untenable, so much the better.", "recommendationCount": 49}, {"assetID": 1909431, "replies": [], "lft": 16, "assetURL": "http://projects.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/09/30/cyberbullying-and-a-students-suicide/campus-bullying-as-a-human-rights-issue", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2618629, "rgt": 17, "userDisplayName": "Laura", "createDate": "1285904483", "userID": 53811379, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1285907134", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Minnesota", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1285903534", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "It's so hard to deal with issues like bullying that many administrators treat as a \"gray\" offense, when many campuses actively discourage sexual assault and rape victims from contacting local police, preferring victims to contact campus police/officials, first.

But by far the  worst bullying I've experienced has been in the workplace.<br /><br />Until I finally changed my career to something I loved, I worked as a lawyer, mostly in firms, and in very firm there was at least one abusive, nasty, screaming partner, or else an exploitive and/or sexually harassing partner, who made everyone miserable, and who was allowed to get away with it, while the associates and support staff were told to \"let it roll off you.\"  And the one time I worked in-house, a clique of my coworkers deliberately tried to use politics to turn me into the \"odd man out,\" as well as subjecting me to social isolation.<br /><br />As far as I can see, while *some* progress on this issue has been made in the schools -- or at least endless lip service has been paid to it -- we're still living the law of the jungle at workplace bullying.

Good enough for say, a mid-sizer like the 5 Series or E Class, but not quite good enough for a flagship model (granted, this is coming at a saving in the tens of thousands).  But in Korea, the owner of an Equus would probably never get behind the wheel (any respectable owner of an Equus would have a driver).<br /><br />Expect the next generation Equus to be developed w/ the US and European markets in mind (in this manner, the Equus is more analagous to the Toyota Crown Majesta than the LS/Celsior - w/ the Crown Majesta being the Toyota luxury sedan of choice to ferry around top Japanese execs.)<br /><br />As for being an \"imitiation\", the LS was an imitation of the S Class (the LS430 was so much like the S Class of the time, that the head of Mercedes design, Bruno Sacco, publicly vented which is a rarity in the auto design world) and one could also very well say that the 7 Series and A8 were BMW's and Audi's attempt of doing an S Class (Was the VW Phaeton an \"imitation\"?  It was Piech's pet project at VW and in many ways, the Phaeton was superior to its corporate cousin, the A8.)<br /><br />Btw, the Equus and LS460 don't look much at all alike.  Lexus took a BMW bent w/ the LS460 (instead of the previous Mercedes bent) and made the LS460 into a toned down version of the Bangle 7 Series; from the side and rear, the new toned down 7 Series and the LS460 look quite similar).<br /><br />As for the Germans and \"luxury\" - while the flagship sedans have oodles of it (tho not like the British; no one does interiors like the Brits), the 5 Series and E Class only fairly recently have had interiors anywhere worth their price (and even so, one has to pay a premium for the real thing instead of \"leatherette\").<br /><br />Otoh, the C Class and 3 Series have interiors that are a bit too chinzy for their prices, but the worst of all may be the outgoing BMW X3 (BMW thankfully rectified the interior w/ the new X3) which may very well have been the worst interior in a $40K offering by a luxury brand.<br /><br />As for \"performance\", the diff. isn't that different w/ the LS and S Class - and w/ the Equus getting the new 5.0 Tau engine shortly (the Tau V8 making Ward's 10 Best engine list 3 years running), performance wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />The Equus also uses the same ZF sourced transmission that is found in the Jaguar XJ and ZF as well as the 5 Series (tho, w/ the updated Equus w/ the 5.0 V8, Hyundai will be using its in-house developed 8 spd AT).<br /><br />Also, aside from the Mark Levinson sound system in the LS, the Lexicon system in the Equus is better than that in the Germans.<br /><br />But yes, overall, the package isn't quite that of say, the 7 Series,  but early reports from owners of the Equus are quite positive.<br />", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 2509010, "replies": [], "lft": 52, "assetURL": "http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/reviewing-the-hyundai-equus/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3523625, "rgt": 53, "userDisplayName": "MacBones", "createDate": "1299988965", "userID": 22396034, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299992857", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299992857", "commentSequence": 24, "commentBody": "Oh my.

As I looked up at him in horror and alarm, he smiled, then slammed the door shut on my arm again.<br /><br />For crying hunched over while standing, I was dragged down a hallway (I knew I had better not show any resistance, and so went limp), male and female staff members shoved me face down, ripped down my pants, and forced a needle into me.<br /><br />One morning, I woke to see saw a staff member who regularly flew into rages for no reason, with a bandaged hand. A fellow \"inmate,\" who was always quiet and reserved, now had a severely and newly bruised face.<br /><br />On the outside, I was laughed at in a \"counseling\" program for daring to want to better myself by learning another language.<br /><br />When I was too upset to work after surviving such experiences, I decided to volunteer to help people such as myself. Before I could start, I had to go to an staff orientation session first, with people who, unlike me, were being paid to \"care for\" people such as myself. In this session, the newly hired staff members sneered at and demeaned the people they had previously encountered and would again encounter - more accurately, again abuse - in their \"work,\" including people in group homes. And the trainers did not discourage such sneering.<br /><br />The best punishment? These abusers should be locked up as \"consumers\" and \"cared for\" by wonderful people such as themselves.<br /><br />I am starting to shake and I am even scared to post this.

I can get up at night without someone - a staff member - repeatedly trying to shove me to the floor.<br /><br />I just pray that more of these stories are written, and no excuses are accepted, such as the staff member saying they are working with \"difficult populations.\"<br /><br />That's hooey.<br /><br />As far as people with developmental disabilities, isn't that the point? How dare they expect people with limited physical or mental abilities to be easy to help, that is, easy to \"control\"?<br /><br />And even in the case of those called \"mentally ill,\" statistics in the United States and Britain show that those diagnosed as mentally ill are violent at no greater a rate than the rest of the population.

I know, I know...YOUR goals are virtuous and good, so it is ok to exploit the earthquake and tsunami for your own aims. This is a natural catastrophe! It is not an earthly referendum on nuclear policy, global warming, whale hunting, or the human race's wastefulness.....lord, do you really believe that being so neagative about the world is helpful or intelligent?

What is ironic is that when they were build, the tsunami was only a Japanese word innate to their experience and knowledge. As is the modus operandi of the greed creed corporate world, nobody thought about building some 50 feet tall steal enforced 6 feet thick concrete walls to keep out tsunami menace. Then again 8.9 earthquakes are not an every day occurrence. Japan along with all the west is bogged down with the same fundamentally flawed economic system, and these greed creed shyster bankers all the way from the so called the private entity federal reserve, with no amenability, transparency, rules, regulations  and answerable to no body, all in the interest of the perpetual secret stock holders keep on pushing it down the peoples throat to the perpetual ultimate.<br /><br />This crooked timber of humanity is not likely to change.

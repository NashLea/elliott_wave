Bush and failing to mention job creation under the tax and fiscal policies of Bill Clinton.<br /><br />You say President Reagan created 18 million jobs by the time he left office in January 1989.  Granted he created jobs during his 2 terms in office, but it was closer to 16 million jobs, not 18 million.  And his tax and spending policies produced the greatest deficits in the aggregate of all presidents up to that time.  But why quibble.<br /><br />On the other hand, Bill Clinton added 22 million jobs during his 2 terms in office (33-1/3% more than Reagan), and, despite the unanimous opposition of Republicans in the House and Senate, enacted tax policies (ie.g., highest individual income tax rate 39.6%) and a budget that not only led to lthis large number of jobs, but also left office with a surplus - a surplus so huge that our entire national debt could have been paid off in several years.<br /><br />Then what does George W. Bush do?  He pushes through tax cuts and lowers the top individual tax rate down to 35% and cuts the maximum capital gains rate and tax on dividends to 15%, while at the same time failing to rein in spending and ushering in 2 costly wars without the fiscal discipline to pay for them.  Did those tax and fiscal policies lead to the same job growth under the tax and fiscal policies of the Clinton administration?  Au contraire - the Bush administration created approximately 1 million jobs during his 8 years in office, which comes to a measly 125,000 jobs per year.  And of all presidents during the last 90 years, including Herbert Hoover, job growth under Bush was actually negative during his first term in office - no other prior president had that distinction.<br /><br />In addition, the Republicans' and Bush's tax and fiscal policies during his first term in office completely squandered the surplus they inherited from the Clinton administration, and - together with the lax regulatory enforcement by his administration (basically in cahoots with industry) brought this nation to the brink of economic and financial collapse and days, if not hours away, from a second Great Depression.<br /><br />Given this legacy, why would we want to go back to the failed tax and fiscal policies of the republicans and the Bush administration?  Rather, the Bush tax cuts should be left to expire for the wealthiest and the tax rates should revert to what they were during the Clinton administration (39.6% highest individual rate and maximum 20% capital gains rate).   Per above, those sound tax and fiscal policies led to 22 million jobs creeated during the Clinton administration and a huge surplus.  Shouldn't we go back to something that worked, and worked very well?

They were going to resort to their usual distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies no matter which Democrat was elected president but the fact that the first African-American president was elected caused the right wing to go into panic mode and desperation.

Obama had a choice between huge deficits or saving the country from outright collapse, and he chose the only wise course any true leader would.<br /><br />Although the healthcare bill needs to be revised to enact more cost containment and to include more robust tort reform, the fact remains that more than 30 million Americans will have medical insurance that never had it before. That alone is an achievement that has eluded every president for the past sixty years and should be lauded, not denigrated.<br /><br />The financial reform package isn\u2019t as strong as it should be, but it is far better than anything we ever had before, and it will help enormously to prevent more Wall Street barons from bankrupting our country while they abscond with the savings of everyday workers.<br /><br />Obama is a black man and that alone has caused the right wing to go apocalyptic and predict the end of America because this black man is in the White House. The right wing in America, and the far right wackos like Limbaugh, Hannity, Beck and Coulter and the fools who drink their Kool-Aid are doing whatever they can to scare the bejeesus out of everyday men and women in America with their lies about Obama wreaking havoc on our country. They fail to acknowledge anything he has done that is bettering the lives of everyone.

He has restored the reputation of America as country that seeks multi-lateral solutions to the worlds ills rather than acting unilaterally like a bull in a china job the way Bush did.<br /><br />The right wing in the Tea Party movement and the Republican Party will deny they are racists and that Obama\u2019s race has anything to do with them working day and night to tear him down, but like most of their agenda and their beliefs, it is one giant lie they will never publicly admit. It\u2019s driving them crazy to have a black man in the Oval Office, and what they have yet to learn is that hatred and racism will not put people back to work, will not heal the sick, will not help the elderly and infirmed, nor will it restore America to be the light of nations it once was and that Obama is working hard to see make happen again.

The public cannot be satisfied, and are ready to pounce on Mr. Obama with total disregard for the facts.  Clown pundits like Beck and Limbaugh, and Republicans in general, are spewing a constant stream of invective, innuendo, and outright falsehoods designed to keep the administration off balance, and it is having an effect.  Mr. Obama is being attacked for his successes as well as his failures, and the ignorant masses are buying what they are being told.  The result is for him to become hypersensitive and defensive, and to swing at the occasional wild pitch.<br /><br />Mr. Obama is notoriously even-tempered, and has hesitated to strike back.  But on the few occasions that he has, I think people have responded positively.  I wish that he would take off the gloves and fight these insidious forces bare knuckle.

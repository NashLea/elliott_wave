To my great relief, I found out that the practice is not prevalent there as it is in Egypt and, I suspect, other Arabic nations. I came across an essay written by then PhD-candidate Meryem Fati (linked below). In it, she describes the history of FGM on the African continent before and after the advent of Islam.<br/><br/>It is going to be a long and very difficult fight to eradicate this most barbaric of practices. One way we can help in the West is by educating our children earlier and more thoroughly about the customs in cultures other than our own. We can bring greater awareness and demand from our leaders that they condition US aid upon the verifiable cessation of practices like FGM, and the acceptance of supplemental aid for education in women and gender studies to be implemented in those countries' public school systems.

Teddy Roosevelt was the \"Trust Buster\" (and a Republican too) whom modern Republicans (former Democrats from the deep south) despise. The laws protecting labor were a direct result of the Robber Baron business policies of the likes of Gould, J. P. Morgan, Pullman, and others, using child labor, company town labor camps (complete with \"Company Stores\") etc. For modern Republicans those were \"The Good Old Days\". The modern Republicans do not want modern labor (read: Black &amp; brown) to benefit from government that enriched whites. The Robber Baron Koch, et. al. are doing it again.<br/>When Hoover was president, he, and said party, let Business (Capitolism) run rampant, as did G. W.

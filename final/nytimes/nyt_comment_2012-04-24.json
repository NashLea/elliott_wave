The cylinders between the planets (we now have a new cylinder between the two end Planets A and C) will have as a center line the line between the centers of the two planets it connects.

The cylinder from B to A will now make visible on Plant A a wedge with the surface area of 4 pi r^2 * (BAC/360\u00b0).  The same amount on Planet B will now be made invisible.

By random chance, I had two classes with prominent basketball players during my time at U-M, one of which was a French language class. There's no faking it in a language class. You either know it or you don't and I can say this particular player was as prepared as any other student in the class when called on by the instructor. The other player was in a history seminar and when he showed up unprepared one week, the instructor asked him to just leave and not bother returning until he was prepared and ready to contribute to the discussion. I don't think the instructor even had any idea who he was (hint: Fab Five?) The player returned the next week and was reasonably prepared each class thereafter.<br/>That said, I recognize there have been some difficult issues surrounding athletics (hint again: Fab Five). I was dismayed when shortly after I graduated, U-M started using the \"block M\" in place of the school seal in all of its communications. That sent a unfortunate message in my view. But in all fairness, none of the current  issues at U-M suggest that athletics have substantially compromised the academic integrity of the school, particularly when compared to other universities with major sports programs.

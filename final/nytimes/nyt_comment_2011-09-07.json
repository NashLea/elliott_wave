The NYT writers like to cock a snoot and condescend to US soccer, we're not talented enough, Europeans are SOOO much better than we are, but you shouldn't take that too seriously.  <br/><br/>Klinsman is doing an excellent job.  Players who were nowhere under Bradley are now looking capable of playing on a world stage.  The Times emphasizes that we have only scored one goal in three matches, but what is more important to me is that we have only given up three.  We gave up four to Mexico in the Gold Cup final.  A flat four and no Bornstein is already working wonders.  Remember the early goals in every game in South Africa?  Where are they now? With a decent defense we are in every match we play.<br/><br/>Klinsman is trying lots of different players in lots of different positions, which is exactly what he should be doing at this point in the cycle.  He is clearly developing young and new players who will be able to join the holdovers from the last World Cup at the next one.  We played without Dempsey against Costa Rica and without Donovan today and took a one goal loss each time.  Klinsman is going to have to give up on the lone striker and go to a 2-4-4 sooner or later and the sooner he does the better the team will look.    <br/><br/>Think what our lineup might look like next spring, Altidore, Agudelo, Dempsey, Donovan, Torres, Shea, Edu, Bradley, Beckerman, Bocanegro, Cherundulo, Howard.

The food is so consistently perfect in preparation and quality.  We have appreciated the comfortably luxurious room as well as the gracious service many times.  Craft became our \"special occasion\" restaurant for the last 10 years, first in NYC and now Dallas.  We were fortunate enough to be at Craft the night the restaurant won the James Beard award.  Chef came in the restaurant jubilant and bought champagne for the restaurant.  It was really cool to see his well-earned excitement, and I'm thrilled that Craft continues to thrive.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3122382, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/dear-flofab-my-brotherboyfriendcolleague-eats-like-an-animal/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4470566, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "Patrick", "createDate": "1315354173", "userID": 14303955, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1315368970", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Francisco", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1315365370", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "I've never understood the problem with elbows on the table.

There are plenty of UMC families who don't have a set bedtime. When my own children were in preschool, several of their classmates were wined and dined late into the evening because their parents wanted to go out after work. These were not poor, underprivileged families struggling to get by, these were parents who didn't want to change lifestyle just because they had kids.<br/>You may argue with whether children should go to bed early or not, but please don't make this about \"poor\" vs \"rich\".", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3406219, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 12261462, "replies": [], "commentID": 12276287, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "AJ", "createDate": "1405278645", "userID": 51839868, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1405278666", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 6, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Jackie Gordon", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Midwest", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1405275066", "commentSequence": 12276287, "commentBody": "You say you haven't been modeling this behavior and I velieve you.

You can tell him to keep his complaints to himself. But it's a lot to ask anyone to be greatful for things they may not actually want that much.<br/>My experience is the more parents push the kid to feel greatful or act vindictively if they are not the less likely kids are going to really get to a place where they feel it genuinely. <br/><br/>And finally yes. Some of this is temperamental. Some people naturally feel and are able to express gratitude more easily.

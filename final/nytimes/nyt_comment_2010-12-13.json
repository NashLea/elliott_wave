I'm not sure that matters, because there is very little daylight between Republicans &amp; Obama anyway. As James Galbraith said in a speech at Harvard last month, Obama listens to the guys who caused many of our economic problems. He surrounded \"himself with holdover appointments from the Bush and even the Clinton administrations: ... Geithner..., Bernanke, and ... Summers. These men have no commitment to the base, no commitment to the Democratic Party as a whole, no particular commitment to Barack Obama, and none to the broad objective of national economic recovery....\" Galbraith sees Obama as Bush without the resolve; that is, Worse than Bush.<br /><br />Obama has never stopped carrying water for Wall Street &amp; big business. This week he's holding some business roundtable with 20 CEOs. It wouldn't surprise me if Obama is planning to take Newt Gingrich's hilarious advice to just ask these businessmen how &amp; when they would like the federal government to raise their taxes.<br /><br />In short, Obama &amp; Geithner made the deal with McConnell &amp; Boehner because they all largely agreed anyway. It was a deal hammered out among Republicans. It's a one-hundred percent Republican deal.<br /><br />The country would be better off if Congressional Democrats refused to take the deal. Here's why. The argument that raising taxes on the middle class would be catastrophic is a fallacy. If taxes go up for working Americans, wages will go up, too. That is what has happened historically. On the other hand, if taxes go down -- with these tax cuts -- guess what? Wages will go down, too. That also is what has happened historically. Average workers wages were highest -- what Alan Greenspan called \"wage inflation\" -- when taxes were highest.<br /><br />Particularly because estimates are that under the Obama tax deal, taxes for the poorest Americans will actually RISE, let's let everyone's taxes go up. Within a short time, their wages will go up, too. [See Thom Hartmann on this.]<br /><br />As for the other \"good deals\" Obama extracted: (1) The payroll deduction in the Obama plan is just a scam to make Social Security insolvent so benefits can be cut. (2) The unemployment benefits ARE vitally important, but I really believe enough Republicans will blink when their constituents demand the benefits be continued.<br /><br />So, Congress, just say no to the Republican deal.

And I agree that we should not be selling it as anything near the type of stimulus that is needed to get our economy moving again.  However, there other considerations here.<br /><br />First, this is about more than economic stimulus.  It is also about making sure that 2 million people do not lose their unemployment benefits over the holidays and that 7 million Americans have additional benefits over the coming 13 months.  This is critically important for the millions who would otherwise be reaching the end of their safety net.  That is why I like to call it the unemployment benefits/tax cuts compromise, rather than just the tax cuts compromise.<br /><br />Second, what is the realistic option to this compromise?  Republicans have proven over the past two years that they put their own partisan gain ahead of economic recovery, that they will hold the unemployed hostage in the name of making the rich richer, that they do not believe in economic stimulus, and that things will be even worse when they take over the House next year.  In light of this, none of the good things in this compromise could be obtained otherwise, and the tax cuts for wealthy, including the estate tax changes, would probably turn out even worse if left to next year.<br /><br />Finally, let's keep our eye on who the real culprits are here.  We may have legitimate reasons to be disappointed in President Obama, but it is the Republicans who are the real bad actors here.  If we progressives want to make political progress, let's focus our vitriol against the Republican hostage takers, not against a President who is doing what he thinks need to be done to get an extension of unemployment benefits and some stimulus for our economy.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br />  ", "recommendationCount": 241}, {"assetID": 2181786, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2983657, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "Mike K", "createDate": "1292213861", "userID": 17832318, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1292218061", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Irving, TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1292218061", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "Ian't it part of the Powell Doctrine that every resource and tool should be used to achieve decisive force against the enemy?<br /><br />In this case the enemy would be the \"stalled economic engine\".<br /><br />Of course the rest of the Powell Doctrine with it's exit strategy admonition - that's another story.<br /><br />But this clearly isn't overwhelming force.

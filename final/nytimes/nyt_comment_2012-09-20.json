The problem with piling on Romney is it ignores the real disease sapping America's strength and foreshortening our future: we're top-heavy and oscillating from port to starboard on the verge of capsizing because those who do the real work of America, those who give our money value and protect that value, are hammered mercilessly by the low cunning of elites with clean, soft hands.

The American people deserve choices. Do we continue with trickle-down and austerity policies, where we see the gap between the wealthy and everyone else is growing wider and wider, or do we put America back to work by reducing speculation and stimulating the economy?<br/><br/>The CPC\u2019s anti-austerity budget achieves deficit reduction mostly from new revenue generated by increasing demand in the overall economy. After WWII, the country made investments to grow the economy: the interstate highway system, investments in housing, conversion of military plants, the GI Bill, the NASA program. By 1978, we reduced the debt from over 120 percent of GDP to under 30 percent. That is how the country paid off its debt while, at the same time, improving the standard of living for workers.<br/><br/>Pope Francis understands economics better than most conservatives. He rightly points out that voodoo economics has been a failure:<br/><br/>\u201cSome people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world.

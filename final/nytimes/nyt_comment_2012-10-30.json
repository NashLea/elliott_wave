But let's do a little thought experiment.

Let's say that a Japanese-American lobbying group gave huge amounts of money to one or both of our major parties, in order to make sure that Washington's ties with Tokyo remained close and friendly. Frequently, they might use the language: \"we Japanese are the divine race,\" just as Jews call themselves \"the Chosen People.\"<br/><br/>This of course is not true: Japanese-Americans have always made it clear that although they are proud of their culture, they are Americans first, and that they support America's interests even when they contravene Tokyo's (I know, because I live in Hawaii, which has a large Japanese-American population).<br/><br/>Japan is a foreign state; we owe it no loyalty, although we shouldn't do its people harm.

We continue to fly/train all over the country every day to meet with university professors when it could easily be done via a video conference.  There was talk last year about letting people work from home or from community-based work places, but it never happened.<br/><br/>In my neighborhood, three houses in the last year have been knocked down and rebuilt, and the replacements were larger and with no evidence of any energy efficient building materials or architectural strategies.  <br/><br/>I do believe people are buying more energy-efficient appliances.  We are a nation of extreme consumption (people routinely line up at the department stores in Shibuya fifteen minutes before opening to buy $50 boxes of sweets or \"rare, limited foods\"), and it will always be easier to buy something new than to actually remove the appliance all together.  I can't speak for the rest of Japan, but our TEPCO rates have been raised twice in the last year.  I imagine that will have a larger impact than any government policy--unfortunately the people who will be forced into bearing the brunt of the conservation will be the poorer class.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3339718, "replies": [], "lft": 278, "assetURL": "http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/how-to-avoid-a-smartphones-bite/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7516811, "rgt": 279, "userDisplayName": "qpstore", "createDate": "1351570104", "userID": 66861939, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1351570155", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "london", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1351566555", "commentSequence": 112, "commentBody": "Intelligent mobile phone really convenience to our life, but ordinary mobile phone also have the value of existence", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3345708, "replies": [], "lft": 2439, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/us/hurricane-sandy-churns-up-east-coast.html", "parentID": 7516488, "commentID": 7516760, "rgt": 2440, "userDisplayName": "Just Words", "createDate": "1351569776", "userID": 43353477, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1351570755", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "USA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1351567156", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Good advice! and Go Beavers!", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3345708, "replies": [], "lft": 2339, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/us/hurricane-sandy-churns-up-east-coast.html", "parentID": 7516116, "commentID": 7516772, "rgt": 2340, "userDisplayName": "Laura L.", "createDate": "1351569823", "userID": 26249845, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1351570785", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York, New York", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1351567185", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "Suhail,<br/><br/>At its best, New York City is a community, so the issue is not as simple as the wind speed in Central Park.

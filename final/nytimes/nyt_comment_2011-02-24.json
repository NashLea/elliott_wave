My husband and I both attended HBCUs, and had opportunities to attend TWI institutions but preferred the HBCU. Things have worked out pretty well in our careers.  Completing school at an HBCU did not make us narrow-minded about working in corporate America. We both work in environments that are comprised primarily of more Whites than African-Americans, and we've met the challenges when they arise and moved through them confidently. That's what a strong developmental foundation  during college has provided for us in the HBCU experience. Interestingly enough, one of our children attempted college at a TWI, and failed misrably after attending mostly white middle and high schools.  Our younger children however attend(s) (ed) the best HBCU's, love(s)(d) the college experience, felt a real sense of community and belonging immediately, and are on point with non-HBCU students in terms of academically competitiveness and wage ratio. Statistics are strongly subjective, it's all in how we slice the numbers to tell the story. Like in every facet of our fallen economy, there are some HBCU's that are not doing well, but this is not a call to question the affectiveness of all HBCU's.   When picking an institution of higher learning, it pays to know where your student will perform best and achieve the results they aspire to, whether at a TWI or an HBCU.

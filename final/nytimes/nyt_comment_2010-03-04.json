The Cancunization of the entire coast is rampant.<br />If you need any more evidence of problems in the area: Tulum, Dec 2009, \"12th Journalist Gunned Down In Mexico This Year\" - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ddZ6u0\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/ddZ6u0</a> - \"It is said that Velazquez, as he was dying, accused allies of the Mayor of Tulum of being responsible for his death\"<br /><br />This was the email response from the owners after contacting them three times: \"We take all customer communications seriously and have taken time to consider the matter you brought to our attention thoroughly.  We discussed this matter with the appropriate authorities and our management team.  All parties agreed that without any evidence, we can do nothing in response\" Somehow I find it extremely unlikely they went to the Mexican Police and told them one of their waiters has been accused of drugging a customer.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1220383, "replies": [], "lft": 840, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/health/policy/04health.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1650075, "rgt": 841, "userDisplayName": "CBWHITE", "createDate": "1267675888", "userID": 35424288, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267681979", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Houston, Texas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267681979", "commentSequence": 390, "commentBody": "<br />As the product of a Northeast Louisiana Farmer, Baptist Minister, and Usher Board President. both my parents always extolled the virtue of this one old adage to myself and my eight siblings: \"Don't merely listen to what people say?\" \"No, watch what they do?\"<br /><br />This is what Utah Sen.

It is governed undemocratically with arcane and feudal rules and traditions such as the one that let Senator Bunning hold up the will of 99 other senators. The filibuster is another one of those  measures, one that kept civil rights and even anti-lynching bills from being passed for almost a century.<br /><br />Now another strange rule: the reconciliation process is being used to circumvent the stranglehold of the filibuster. Reconciliation is being implemented to allow for majority rule in this case. I can see why the Republicans are mad: they don't like the rule that lets the Democrats get around their favorite rule of the moment---though they used reconciliation to bankrupt us with the Bush tax cuts. I can see why they're mad, but their claim that it's undemocratic is completely bogus.

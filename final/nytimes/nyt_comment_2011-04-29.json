Too much information, perhaps, but it's what we've got.  On the former, following water vapor maps over a period of time shows the evolution of storms is following a pattern.  Science tries to make it clear that *no single storm* can be attributed to climate change but the *trend over time and space* is characteristic of what we can expect.  This is exploited to encourage us to ignore what we can see and feel as we reel in shock from one natural catastrophe to another.  We are ill served by this attempt to distract us from the need to look at our expanding population and consumption model on a finite planet, an irresistible force meeting an immovable object.<br/><br/>It is important to understand that increasing greenhouse gases, despite their minority status in our atmosphere (and the undoubted fact that water vapor only amplifies the effect, though that too has increased with warming), have changed the way heat is reflected outwards, and that this pattern is accelerating, so the relatively small effects so far are just a taste of what is likely.  This has increased the energy in the system, and changed the circulation patterns to a certain extent.

While at the university, he wrote a simplified systems theory for understanding general systems operation and dynamics, and developed a methodology to help understand the health of a given system. He worked, with the assistance of Dr. Jonas Salk, developing The Learning Center/PATH Project, which was presented to the US Department of Education and EDUCOM and developed the TLC/PATH project for the Reagan administrations, 'School 2000' project.<br/><br/>More recently he has conducted research, analysis and development efforts in energy efficient urban and industrial structures and was awarded a patent for a time management system he invented. John typically works with entrepreneurs and companies in early stages of innovative projects in feasibility and market identification.<br/><br/>John studied engineering and early in his career worked in the media industry in production; and for the Department of Defense while living at the NATO base in Iceland. After 9/11 he worked with Homeland Security to help bring the TSA security force up to speed.<br/><br/>He enjoys writing, and examining systems interaction and dynamics.

It should be to cut taxes across the board and purge loopholes. An untouchable loophole like the mortgage interest deduction is illustrative. It benefits the rich more than the poor (as the rich have borrowed more money for bigger houses). It causes housing prices to go up (as people are able to spend more on housing) and is really therefore only a boon to the real estate agents (a deduction for mortgage interest doesn't do much for the taxpayers if it drives the price of housing up).  However, if something like this were discussed openly, Democrats would submarine it by saying that it was a cut on benefits to millions of working class Americans (ignoring a corresponding reduction in their tax rates).

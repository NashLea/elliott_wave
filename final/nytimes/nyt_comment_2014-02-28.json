You are tracked by your phone, by your IP address, the Garmin in your car, by the street cameras, by the police scanners that record everyone's license plates/movements, etc etc etc...<br/><br/>I hate the notion that anyone can spy on me, but I know there's little I can do about it, unless I am obsessive about it.  And even then, it's futile if I'm a target worth spying on - NSA will bounce lasers off my walls/windows and record my conversations, will place surreptitious hardware in my devices and a slew of other surveillance I'm not even aware of.

Nobody can remotely plug in a camera, flip an analog switch or remove electrical tape from a laptop camera and microphone. After that, I'd say the problem becomes too large. It's just like robbery-proofing your house. If your house takes more than thirty seconds to get into, they say, there are a lot of other houses on the block. <br/><br/>If hackers or the CIA or whatever group has targets a person specifically, that's a completely different story. My philosophy is that you do as much as you reasonably can to protect yourself opportunists and idiots, and then it's up to fate. There are lots of stories about people who had life-long fear of something, did everything to avoid that kind of death, and were hit by a falling piano or something. You can't let fear rule your life.  (But it does make me look a little more sideways at my smart phone.)<br/><br/>And Paul, it's not just the NSA. It's almost anybody with the right level of hacker abilities. With training and intention/desire, anyone could hack into your home. I'm sure that's why NSA is doing this - they know what's possible, and right or wrong (sadly I think they don't know) they want to get a jump on it."}]}, "lft": 142, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/technology/british-spies-said-to-have-intercepted-yahoo-webcam-images.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11245308, "rgt": 147, "userDisplayName": "Adrienne", "createDate": "1393563122", "userID": 55989747, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1393564680", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Boston", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1393610654", "commentSequence": 11245308, "commentBody": "I've always thought the only thing that kept people from snooping on us would be the sheer amount of people and data to be sifted through.

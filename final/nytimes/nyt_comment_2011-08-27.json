The rain in wind has much more weight than snow and carries much more force against objects.  (By the way, tropical weather rain drops are actually twice the size of those in land-based storms.)<br/><br/>As snow blows and drifts, it tends to cover objects it encounters, actually holding them in place.  Wind and rain in tropical systems move and lift objects and turn them into projectiles that in turn batter or penetrate what they encounter.  Snow may overload a roof; tropical winds will tear it off and send it flying.<br/><br/>In winter, the leafless trees offer little resistance to the wind; a tree in full leaf is much more likely to come down in the wind.  In the winter, the root systems are held firmly in frozen ground.  Your soils are so saturated that the trees are going to go down, half of their root systems rising out of the ground, the other half actually pushing down into the saturated soils.  This in turn wreaks havoc on underground utilities.<br/><br/>I don't know how long a nor'easter's highest winds last, but you're going to have at least tropical storm force winds for over 18 hours in your area, without letup and with higher gusts.  Embedded in these winds will be tornadoes, if things weren't interesting enough.<br/><br/>Nor'easters don't cause refineries to shut down or cause long-lasting shortages of gasoline.<br/><br/>And I don't know of a nor'easter that has ever cut power to nearly 60 million people in 10 states.<br/><br/>In no way is a nor'easter \"basically a winter hurricane\".

It is not fair to say such things to a people who earn far far less than the average American and have to cope with stringent social mobility restraints depriving them of proper medical care and the best education (people who live in the countryside need a special permit to become a \u201ccitizen\u201d of a major city to receive western amenities  that we take for granted). China is making a concentrated effort to improve the lives of its citizens (yes, really!), and while it may not be exemplary in the eyes of the west, it is still commendable for bringing hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and supplying them with a /better/ education than generations previous...<br/><br/>2) People who I have talked to in my age group (20-30's) often think that Chinese traditional medicine is silly, out-dated and old-fashioned. They embrace western medicine and modern society and /are/ capable of thinking for themselves. They may not choose to do this publicly of course, but if the numerous protests and riots (mainly over corruption, migrant labor and the environment) that have happened over the past year are any indication, China is well on its way to a maturing society<br/><br/>3) Finally, any brutality measured against the noble animals of our planet should be met with equal condemnation but calls for an equitable response and not vitriol.

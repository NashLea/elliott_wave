And the point is that Dr. Lesser's curiosity was tweaked by a \"soft\" clinical finding, leading to further questioning and then diagnostic bloodwork/imaging.  Plus you're assuming that images of her extremities would have added any additional clues in someone with pretty early signs of acromegaly. <br/><br/>Interesting case in that she had supposedly normal visual fields - but was seen by a neuro-opthalmologist, a subspecialty that sees a fair amount of patients with acromegaly.

But there is no report of visual acuity, color vision, or presence of an afferent pupillary defect. I'm certain these were tested by both eye doctors.<br/><br/>There are no visual fields - and I suspect that they were not truly \"normal\" but instead either show a altitudinal defect or at least depression in foveal sensitivity. Fields help distinguish whether this is truly a unilateral process or a chiasmal syndrome. I suspect that the patient does have diabetic papillitis, but not enough information is given to rule out other conditions. It would be nice to know if the disc edema was thought due to this (which is what I think) or due to compression through the optic canal from the acromegaly - this is a slow process and often presents as unilateral optic atrophy, not edema. Pituitary lesions need to be quite large to impinge on the optic chiasm or optic nerves, typically at least 10mm in size, and this \"very small\" lesion would not cause disc edema. <br/><br/>This patient's past history would've bought her an MRI with contrast to rule out demyelinating conditions anyway (which presumably would've shown the pituitary lesion) given that she had an ocular motility disturbance (which could have been an internuclear ophthalmoplegia) and urinary problems. <br/><br/>I'm not disagreeing with the diagnosis, just the order in which things were presented.", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

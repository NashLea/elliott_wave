You write for most of us who are fed up and realize systemic change is needed. The tinkering that President Hope N. Change recommends -- let us know who the big donors are -- is laughable. We need to get rid of the big donors. Period.<br /><br />One of the elite groups you failed to mention in your stellar essay was The Nine, five of whom have decided that free speech means never having to say who you are but shelling out the big bucks with impunity is A-okay. Justice Scalia's stated attitude is that if you don't like it, change the Constitution. And that's precisely what must be done to \"take back America,\" as the confused tea partiers urge. We need a Constitutional Amendment initiating public financing of campaigns.<br /><br />Another establishment elite you didn't mention are the media. The media roar against such an amendment will be fierce, because the media are prime beneficiaries in the current system. Even when they offer politicians cut rates on political ads (and they do), the media make a killing during every election cycle. Not only are many media outlets now controlled by right-wing publishers like Rupert Murdoch &amp; Richard Mellon Scaife -- who operate most of their papers at a terrific loss, on, well, paper -- but whatever their editorial viewpoint, they are all beholden to politicians who help underwrite their operations.<br /><br />So we average Americans have these elements of the elite working against us: the three branches of government, the financial industry, other corporate fat cats, and the media. Our only hope is a proper, peaceful Constitutional revolt.

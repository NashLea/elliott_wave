I think Antonio Allen made real strides, and Milliner is nothing close to the bust that many critics have said he is. Cro at full strength is at best an average corner - he can be broken down by top receivers, and has been even in his best years. We can't seriously bring back Ed Reed, certainly not as a starter. So we need serious competition back there, and you can't rely on the draft for starting secondary players. You need too much instinct and recognition to play well back there, <br/><br/>Yes we can go into next camp with Geno in competition with an experienced veteran, and may the best man win. And if Geno shows signs of becoming more consistent, amen and let the growth continue. And if not, let the veteran step in, and start planning for the next franchise QB to be drafted. <br/><br/>There is no need to pay big money for a receiver, because rookie receivers CAN step in and start. And yes we need a solid pick there. Anyone who has watched Dez Bryant knows what an ace receiver can do for a quarterback. But I do not consider receiver a wasteland on this team. With a consistent quarterback, we have guys who can make plays.

They were given no followup care. They were often too weak to work, so instead of making a small amount of money they lost their entire lifetime earning capacity.

If they got kidney failure later in their life they wouldn't be able to afford dialysis, much less a transplant, so they would just die.<br /><br />Gary Becker wants to be able to buy organs if he needs them, because he's rich, rather than having to give or get them from a relative.

I fear that the process of making more organs available will also deepen the hold of a market system approach to health care in the U.S. that already favors those with heavier wallets way too much.  The vaunted \"death panels\" that Sarah Palin alluded to in her fight against the recent  health reform law already exist.  Those that cannot pay for healthcare-poor children, the unemployed, and those who just do not earn enough to have good insurance already feel the force of the \"market.\"  Third world countries already have citizens who have sold their organs on the black market.  We already are getting so little in terms of real preventative health care when one thinks of what is spent.  I really distrust the central thesis of this article:  that the \"market\" would   be able to regulate the process of organ donation in a way that would not value those people who have more money as being \"more equal\" than those who do not, or would not encourage poor people to sell parts of themselves to those richer than they are-a nightmare scenario that we do not seem very far from, judging from the on-going spectacle of patients who are not deemed \"worth\" a transplant operation dying in Arizona.   The inhumanity implicit in our current health care \"system\" is stunning.  I fear that this inhumanity will soon extend to encouraging poor people to barter their bodies for the social security that the U.S. now seems determined to deny to its citizens.  What makes this lack of compassion even more stark is the fact one can now cut taxes on the richest people in society, and then spend millions of dollars on endless war,  while at the same time asserting that one cannot 'afford' to support the growing ranks of the poor, or to improve education, or to support workers.  I fear that all too soon, the spectacle of those dying from the lack of transplant operation will change to the spectacle of people dying from botched donation operations, or from conditions made worse when they felt the pressure to donate an organ-to avoid homelessness, or to eat another day.", "recommendationCount": 39}, {"assetID": 2177107, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/nyregion/12critic.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2981085, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "anonymous of course", "createDate": "1292141819", "userID": 43996384, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1292147644", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1292147644", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "The writer says this about his cousin: \"At age 37, he got a new heart.

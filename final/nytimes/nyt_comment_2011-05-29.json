How does this happen?  Where do these people, and their ideas, come from?  I think to address this problem, and others like it, we must root out the source of the problem.  Our system of higher education has become a joke.  Colleges and Universities today are little more than baby-sitting services for kids we'd like to keep out the workforce long enough that they stand some chance of showing up to work without a hangover.  Why?  Because faculty cannot fail their students.  No matter how poor their performance, we molly coddle them until they receive their diplomas, because if we didn't, we couldn't pay the bills.  Which isn't entirely true - we could pay the bills, but the profit motive now rules supreme, an actual education notwithstanding.  And with highly regarded credentials in hand, the frat boys take up positions of undue influence, and make a complete mess of everything.

It could still become one of the most famous in history.<br/><br/>For millennia, governments struck coinage. Now they have farmed out the function to private money creators called bankers. Interestingly, for nearly 2,000 years in the West, the government created money (with a face value higher than its real value), but taxes were farmed out to private enterprises. Now it's the other way around. Why? Because the plutocrats have found money creation to be their best trick in a long time, to get ever more power.<br/><br/>The decades of prosperity after World War Two came after nearly two decades of massive equalitarian intervention of governments in the economy, characterized by massive technological and sociological development.

Physical science, over the years developed many sophisticated measuring instruments with very high level of accuracy and precision.

This pearreview process forced the deficient models or theories to change or even completely thrown out.<br/><br/>Economist have a great challenge to improve its measurement capabilities. First, it uses parameters those are not physical and most conceptual. Secondly, the method of measurement the values of those parameters are too much error prone - survey, sample survey,...As a result, many economic theories, which should be in the dustbin of knowledge, are still in use and many economists practice those. <br/><br/>Economics will never be a science unless economist address this measurement issue. <br/><br/>Biology went through this transformation after the invention of double helix.<br/><br/>Big data can give the opportunity to change this - but standardization  at international level is still big question mark.

What a shame that your mother and your family had to suffer through all that unnecessary pain and indignity. I started a career in the health care field with direct patient contact at all stages of life and end of journey situations. I soon realized that I had a very tidy and romanticized view of the death process in a medical setting. I quickly learned it was frequently not fast and many times it was dragged out mercilessly even when the hope of a return to previous level of function and stable health was gone. I think the breakdown occurs when patients and their families are not provided enough information about probable outcomes. Families and patients need an advocate in that setting who can unemotionally give them facts so compassionate decisions can be made. And they need time to process the information. Our Social Workers and Case Managers need the luxury of more time with these patients to make the transition easier.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3445006, "replies": [], "lft": 574, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/my-marriage-didnt-end-when-i-became-a-widow/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 20176530, "rgt": 575, "userDisplayName": "Ed Carlstead", "createDate": "1476814523", "userID": 77117935, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1477295480", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Denver", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1477291880", "commentSequence": 20176530, "commentBody": "Lucy:  I found your book on Amazon and bought it as a companion to \"A Grief Observed.\"  Thank you for undertaking to have your husband's book published.

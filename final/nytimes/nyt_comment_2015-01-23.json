In puzzling over your question. I think it can be explained by the policy response to the financial blow out and the following recession.  Our response was weak and the rhetoric leading up to the 2010, if I rccall was debt and deficit.  The rhetorivc was from some very serous people including a former Fed Chairman.  Then the newly elected T-Party sunk their teeth into the issue including the \"gangs of X\" and Bowles Simpson.  They even had me believe that we were going to do a double-dip recession.  So Europeans were not going to lead with monetary or fiscal stimulus, unless they were nuts.  Many of your commenters are saying that the US has not really recovered.  The Fed actions really just recovered the losses off those that had some skin in the market.  It brought up our averages but was brutal toward those who lost their job and was too old to reclaim employment.  As a result the concentratinn of income and stagnant wages has hollowed out America's sttrength.

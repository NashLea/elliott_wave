Instead, I offer a possible solution to the googol question without using logs of large numbers.<br/><br/>First, say that an even number n is the product of two even factors.  There is no trapezoidal decomposition based on this factorization (see below, this post is out of space).<br/><br/>So, in examining an even number for trapezoidal decompositions, we can only look at cases where n is an even number that is factored into one odd factor and one even, named ODD and EVEN.  For each pair (ODD, EVEN), n can be represented as a) The sum of ODD successive integers around EVEN, and b) The sum of 2*EVEN successive integers around ODD/2.<br/><br/>  But I want to discount cases using integers less than 1.

Since ODD/2 cannot equal EVEN, then either the first inequality holds or the second, but not neither.

Any hunter that needs an assault weapon to kill animals is not a skilled hunter.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe in the 21st century that some teachers now are hoping to arm themselves and I assume to take their weapons into the classroom.   What is the likelihood that a teacher, regardless of his or her training, would be able to draw the weapon, shoot and hit a sociopath intent on taking lives with an assault weapon in a moment of extreme tension and fear?   The likelihood is strong that a stray bullet from a well intentioned teacher or school personnel would hit a child rather than the shooter.<br/><br/>I admire Mayor Bloomberg for this stance, it will take someone with will and finances to take on the NRA, which becomes more entrenched in their positions as the years go by.

America has no obligation to provide anything to anyone.  What this great country provides is opportunity to everyone, enormous opportunity and it always has throughout its history.  But in order to take advantage of opportunities, one must have education and skills and courage and perseverance and intelligence and guts to take risks and be flexible.  No one gets what they want.  Everything is compromise.  No one is indispensable.<br />Every young person must learn that you must do things to make yourself better and more distinguished than others.  Otherwise no one will notice you and aid you and help you.  But you must be flexible.<br />If you are on a job on a construction project, for example, say a painter, and the supervisor comes and says lay down that paint brush, we must do some plumbing or mow grass or sweep the walks outside today, if you run your mouth that you are only a painter and will not and cannot do these other tasks, you will quickly find out you are out of work.  You will be fired on the spot.  Everyone must learn to be flexible and cooperative on jobs.  There will no  indulgence to such bad attitudes at any level on any job period.  Everyone must learn to place the interests of their employer above their selfish interests.<br />If they work hard and use intelligence, they will usually be noticed and rewarded.  If not, they will be on the street where they belong.<br />America is not the same as the old days.  Our good for nothing non representatives in Congress have sold everyone out for selfish short term gain.  However, America is still the land of opportunity.  Unfortunately our institutions of higher learning are now institutions of indoctrination and cesspools of brainwashing.  Who would want to hire one of these idiots anyway?  Would you spend your hard earned money on one of them who likely cannot even change a flat tire on his car, let alone a faucet washer in his bathroom?<br />Just to illustrate how stupid some college graduates are, only yesterday the Athletic Director of the University of Georgia in Athens who earned $550,000 per year, lost his job.  Do you know why?  He was caught drunk driving in Atlanta in his 2009 BMW with a woman sitting next to him with no panties on; her red panties were in between his legs.  He had been awarded two degrees from this so-called university.<br />Can you imagine anything so outlandish and foolish and stupid and idiotic in your life?  By the way he was a married man with a wife and children.<br />Andrew Carnegie came here as a boy from Scotland.  He began working in a mill for almost nothing probably 50 cents a week.  He struggled.  Others observed he was special.  In his lifetime he became the richest man in the world and still is in death.<br />Don't insult us with these sob stories of America.  What is wrong with America today is that the harder one works, the more of his wealth is stolen from him to pay the costs of other good for nothing bums who have the children but not the resources to pay for their costs of upbringing and like Robin Hood, have their wealth taken from them  and given involuntarily to other deadbeats.

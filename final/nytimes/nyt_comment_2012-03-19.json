Do not, however, count me as their defender.  When they do wrong, they need to be exposed and held accountable, something they try very hard to prevent. Taking criminal action, however, would be a drastic step. When people are engaged in ordinary business practices, criminal prosecution is the nuclear option. It makes future business arrangements and operations much more difficult and represents something close to lethality.  A government has ways to demand the responsible individuals be returned. They could, for example, shut down the entire operations of the company.<br/><br/>This appears to be more related to conducting a thorough investigation than necessarily making preparations of prosecutions. As such, it is the government's way of saying \"You will be held accountable\", and making certain that all the facts are gathered.

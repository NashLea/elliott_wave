I've had to be on unemployment in Ohio; so has my husband. We know precisely how it works.<br/><br/>The MAXIMUM you can collect on is $41,600. That means if you earn $100,000, you only get 50% of $41,600. That's the top salary for UI. (I am sure it's more in the expensive states like NY and CA; Ohio is a pretty poor state. It's much LESS in Florida, where I have also been unemployed.)<br/><br/>No matter what you earn, it is 50% of what you earned in the past calendar year (up to $22,300, which is 1/2 of the maximum).<br/><br/>To earn this, you must have worked for the past 6-7 months, and earned a minimum weekly salary (I think $150 a week). So you can't get unemployment just for losing your babysitting gig. it also has to be income \"on the books\".<br/><br/>You can get UI for working as little as 20 weeks in a year, but your UI check then only runs for 20 weeks (not 26).<br/><br/>You misunderstand the \"20 week rule\"; it means \"the previous 12 months\" and not \"inside this calendar year\". So if it's January, your work the previous year counts towards your benefit.<br/><br/>You also misunderstand that the check is only reduced by work you do DURING the period you collect UI checks (not before or after); you CAN work (say, part-time doing temp work) but then your UI check is reduced.<br/><br/>It does NOT mean that you can't work 5 months of the year, and then collect for 7 months, because presumably you worked all of the previous year.

Banning dormancy or inactivity fees on gift cards unless there has been no activity in a 12-month period.<br/><br/>Requiring that card issuers disclose how long it would take to pay off credit card balances if cardholders make only minimum payments each month and how much users would have to pay each month if they want to pay off their balances in\u00a036 months.", "recommendationCount": 14}, {"assetID": 3283590, "replies": [], "lft": 984, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/business/banks-to-make-customers-pay-debit-card-fee.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4610002, "rgt": 985, "userDisplayName": "DB", "createDate": "1317354048", "userID": 6919695, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1317355419", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Los Angeles", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1317351819", "commentSequence": 185, "commentBody": "How is it that we pay no fees to use checks, which are inherently more costly for the banks to process, yet we must pay fees for debit cards which simply electronically transfer money from one account to the other?<br/>\nBecause banks are for profit institutions designed to make money for the investors, we the clients are the source of the profits ... fortunately we have options, in Credit Unions the profits are returned to the clients in services and better loan rates.

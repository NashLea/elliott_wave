So, we were lucky selecting our visit on October 12, 2010.  The museum is located in the Flamino area reached by underground Metro (subway) exit by Piazza Popolo - Flamino Station.  Then by Tram #2 - 4 stops. It's a long walk from the Metro. As we walked down the street after exiting Tram #2, we were blown away by the massive 'skeleton,'  laying on its back at the entrance to the museum.  The building is beautifully designed by Zaha Hadid.  Its awesome.  There are small chairs throughout the museum to take a break.  A very small gift shop.  No postcards available.  No photos are permitted.  Woman with large purses must check them in (free). There's an outdoor courtyard near the cafeteria with a lot of chairs to relax tired feet after leaving the museum.  We enjoyed our 3 hours at the museum, especially the permanent exhibition by Italian Architect Luici Moretti, on the first floor of the three floor museum.  Luici Moretti, designed Watergate in Washington, D.C.  There's a small model of Watergate and its story but not the famous' break in' story.  There's an English version for every exhibit -- something you don't find in too many tourists sites in Rome.  Put it on your list and bring a camera to photograph the outside of the building.

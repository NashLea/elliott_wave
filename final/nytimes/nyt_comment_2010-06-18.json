Otherwise he would never write something so ill-informed.\"<br /><br />To dismiss the oil and gas industry cavalierly as a \"mature\" industry is so simplistic as to be much more wrong than right.<br /><br />Oil and gas is a mature MARKET.  But the industry itself has many facets, some of which have no equal in technological sophistication.<br /><br />Some of the smaller parts of it (production from rod-pumped stripper wells) are indeed fairly described as \"mature\" technology.<br /><br />But the largest frontier fields use pioneering exploration and production methods with enormously exciting cutting-edge technology.<br /><br />The oil and gas industry geologists and petroleum engineers produce 3-dimensional seismic maps of the earth's crust up to 8 miles deep, to a vertical resolution of 5 feet, using Cray supercomputers. They are finding hydrocarbons in granite, which was thought impossible only 10 years ago. Do you really believe their thinking is \"invariably derivative\"?<br /><br />The revolution in shale gas, which just might be the low-carbon salvation of this entire nation, required two enabling technolgies; 1) high pressure fracturing to split low-permeability shale, and 2) the ability to slant drill up to a mile away from the vertical with precision.<br /><br /> These technologies were developed by lean, hungry independent oil and gas companies like Oklahoma-based Devon Energy, Chesapeake and Anadarko.<br /><br />Think a minute as to how you would go about controlling the drill bit on a well that has gone three miles down and one mile horizontal with enough precision to hit a \"pay zone\" no wider than 30 feet.<br /><br />It was not an \"invariably derivative\" thinker who worked that one out.<br /><br />Think about what makes it possible to even contemplate drilling or producing hydrocarbons in 5000 or 7000 feet of water? These are not \"mature\" technologies; they are newer and more innovative than space travel (consider: the Space Shuttle is 1970's technology. The ill-fated Deepwate Horizon was 30 years more modern in every way technology counts)<br /><br />I personally have seen many marvels of great engineering in alternative fuels, better batteries, waste heat recovery and novel chemistry come out of oil companies. The ONLY renewable liquid fuel with any hope of commercialization is biodiesel from algae, which is bank-rolled to the tune of many hundreds of millions of $$ by Exxon-Mobil.<br /><br />It is certainly true that many of the best engineering innovations in the oil and gas industry come from hungry independents.  Indeed, Apache is one of the world leaders in deepwater drilling. Like large organizations of all sorts, big oil companies get sluggish precisely because they are big.<br /><br />But take a look at the patent count coming out of the oil industry compared to others. In 2008 Schlumberger and ExxonMobil both filed for over 250 patents each. This puts them ahead of high tech heavy hitters like Monsanto, Samsung, Merck and Pfizer.<br /><br />In 2008 Shell had a slow year for patents, \"only\" 135.  But this put them ahead of Raytheon, Daimler-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Stanford U and MIT.<br /><br />So I believe the assertion that oil and gas industry engineers are among the worst engineers, \"invariably  derivative\" and that \"few engineers in any field are creative to begin with\" cannot be supported by the facts on the ground.<br /><br />By the way, I fully support the idea of a 3rd party investigation of the sunken Deepwater Horizon.  It should happen, and when it does, it will use ingenious ROV's and high-tech inspection devices already widely deployed on the world's deepwater oil and gas drilling rigs.<br /><br />If you retort, \"If those oil and gas engineers are so smart, why did the BP Macondo well blow out?\" I think the answers are starting to come out of the various investigations on this incident. I emphasize that I speak for no one but myself here, and it is only my own untutored opinion which follows.<br /><br />But my opinion is that, when all the facts are known and all the investigations are completed, well, (how shall I say this delicately?)...BP's reputation for technical competence will not be enhanced.

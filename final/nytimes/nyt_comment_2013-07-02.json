I refused my pain, because unlike so many others who have commented, it was invisible.  Our town acted as if my mother had never existed. The wife of a prominent surgeon and World War II veteran, she broke the rules by not pretending all was well. She couldn't bear (this is conjecture on my part) his silence, his detachment, his workaholism.  Like many spouses of veterans, she manifested the fallout of the war's trauma.

I think throughout the conflict, the North's chief vulnerability was the potential for a loss of political support for the war, which the New York draft riots epitomized. That was the principle goal of Lee's invasion. Longstreet was correct that the Army of Northern Virginia could and should have found ground of their own choosing and then fought a defensive battle that could have resulted in another Fredricksburg and a defeat for the Army of the Potomac, which would have enhanced Lee's goal of undermining support for the war. Of course, as a practical matter, the victory at Gettysburg boosted northern support for the war and bought more time for Winfield Scott's Anaconda Strategy to deprive the South of imported war material.  The victory at Vickburg had the result of isolating 3 southern states and depriving the southern armies of the essential war materiel, men, animals and rations, they could provide. That left it for Grant and Meade to fight the battles of 1864 which drove the ANV back to Richmond while Sherman destroyed the South's ability to supply its army.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3375845, "replies": [], "lft": 56, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/place-with-complimentary-towels/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9365286, "rgt": 57, "userDisplayName": "Warren A.

I cannot afford the obligatory health insurance and so the little money I earn is being taken from me to the level that I can barely pay the rent and food. And I often can't. Health insurance premium is out of the question with the little money they leave me. Because the government simply blocks my earnings and bank account and takes out that premium plus a fine leaving me caught in an everlasting catch 22.<br/><br/>The system we have lacks too, when people are poor.

It could mean other things. For some it could indicate apprehension regarding their success in a new country and as a result suppress the native language in a household. Losing ones cultural ties and language so rapidly in a single generation is unfortunate. Retaining a bit of culture and at least some language is an enrichment to oneself and society. I consider cultural assimilation successful regardless of ones ability to speak your parents language.

Would you not risk everything if the children you loved were suffering in their current situation. There is no such thing as wellfare or foodstamps are traffic laws. I am sure most undocumented adults don't even realize their even breaking the law with a broken tail light. They are just happy to have a car, to go to work, and put food on the table. It is a game of survival. If it was really easy to get a green card don't you think more of the undocumented would get them. Immigration is all about money not about the betterment of people. We need a total overhaul of our immigration system. The American People are so uneducated when it comes to immigration laws because the never had to deal with them.

So, her reaction was to warn me about eating \"too many cheese burgers\"! In the following 3 years I cut out every possible offending thing I could think of, no cheese, little meat...definately no cheeseburgers.  I am a VERY youthful HEALTHY man, that has always monitored my health very closely, and regularly work out , with a tight trim body. Still,this situation was blamed on me, and my \"Bad diet\". Then one afternoon, I had a heartattack! Luckily it was a minor one, and I had a stint placed in my chest. I returned to my Clinic, with reason to believe that this situation might be caused by my meds; so I asked to be changed to another drug regime.  They just would not listen to me, so I forced the issue, and quit my meds.  Finally, I got a new regime...and you know what? The next blood work I had done my cholesteral levels PLUMMETED TO A QUARTER OF WHAT THEY HAD BEEN, and stayed that way ever since.  I know some of these Dr. are working really hard to get things right, but experience in this world of HIV Clinics has shown me that HIV has become more a cash cow for Pharmaceutical Companies, with common sense and compassion a secondary thought, far too often.

The air is a far better insulator than the earth and it can build up charge.  This can cause the local opposite charge of the earth to build up near where the air is charged.  The earth's charge is caused by electrons migrating towards (or away) from the electric field caused by the charged air.  It is this flow of electricity in the earth and build up of a static charge (this is analogous to a capacitor) that causes your hair to stand up on end, and in some cases, for lightning to strike.  This charge, per Gauss' law for conducting objects, will be on its surface.<br/><br/>In this situation, some objects -- those at higher elevations, with sharp point, and better conductors -- will build up greater charge.

My conclusion is that he is more calculating and heartless than I thought possible.  Belittled by Trump, in the most personal of attacks against his family and his wife, he still finds himself able to pull the lever for this man who may be the most dangerous of all presidential candidates in memory.  What now do we think of Ted Cruz?  Here is my conclusion.  He is now thinking beyond this election.  If there is any way to co-opt Trump's supporters after this election relegates Trump to the trash heap of history, Cruz is now thinking he can be that person.  Sad that he would sink so low, but he is nothing but ambitious.  In four years, let us consider his change of mind on Trump as his epiphany.  Power at any cost, including his soul.

For me, the remnants of my religious training can best be described as \"cultural Catholicism.\" I am, however, profoundly appalled and disgusted by the arrogance, hypocrisy and stupidity of the hierarchical Church. As far as I'm concerned no decent, semi-competent god would allow such a perverse entity to survive (I suppose that's an argument from evil). Given that frame of reference, and since the Church survives, I'm pretty much convinced that God doesn't exist. I haven't been a practicing Catholic (whatever that means) for over fifty years. I don't believe in God, have never found any convincing arguments to the contrary.

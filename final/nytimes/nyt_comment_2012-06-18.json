The high labor and benefit costs they demand would simply sink what's left of the US industrial base and do the same for other sectors if unions expanded. The reality is that the world is flat in the words of the Times own Friedman, and returning to the days of trade protectionism or the US manufacturing stuff for our own population are over. <br/><br/>Besides that the general usefulness of unions in the modern US is questionable. Unions had their place when workers were truly abused, but in todays world those kinds of abuses are rare in the US, business treatment of workers is far better regulated, and people have legal recourse that wasn't available in say 1908.

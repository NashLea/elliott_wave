Maybe it's a naive question, since they can and do purchase our bonds  in secondary markets (Floyd Norris had an article a couple of years ago about China buying US debt through banks in the UK), although that  problem too could be dealt with - they could be issued non-transferable, couldn't they?  My point is, we not only don't need the Chinese underwriting over a trillion dollars of our debt (maybe it's closer to 2 trillion now, but Professor K said foreign ownership of US debt, overall, was significantly down in recent years), but they'd be doing us a huge service if they ceased doing so.  We have more than enough of our own banks and super wealthy investors parking money in treasuries already, or investing it in risky ventures abroad. The worst that might happen if China stopped buying would be that yields might rise a little, which could draw some capital home if it rose enough; but with ten year bonds selling at historic lows, and at a low spread over shorter term T-bills, the Chinese not buying is not high among my concerns.

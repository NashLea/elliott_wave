Your disparagement-by-faint-praise of his knack for scoring on \"rebounds\" and \"lucky breaks\" is unpersuasive for several reasons. To the extent it disdains a player's capacity to seize opportunities that flash before him . . . well, you go right ahead and leave that talent off your dream team. \u2022My\u2022 ideal side won't be able to get enough of it!<br/><br/>More importantly, however, your notion that Donovan has substantially made a career on \"lucky breaks\" simply doesn't bear close scrutiny.

But it doesn't wash with a player who's consistently scored remarkable goals over so many years.<br/><br/>The old saw is, \"You make your own luck.\" As somebody who was successful in competitive athletics at a fairly high level for many years, I know just how true that is.

The handwriting has been on the wall since Landon's magical mystery tour to Cambodia and I further suspect that their relationship has been difficult, for reasons known only to them, since Donovan's failed loan experiment at Bayern under J\u00fcrgen. I suspect J\u00fcrgen decided to replace Donovan with the future-Julian Green-and a hungry, in form veteran with no baggage-Wondolowski. At least Landon can console himself in the knowledge that it took two players to replace him. He's had a great career and deserves all the accolades that are coming his way. And he is, so far, handling this with class. Whether this is a mistake by Klinsmann we will never know. Sooner or later every player is cut or dropped or felled by injury. And someone else steps in.

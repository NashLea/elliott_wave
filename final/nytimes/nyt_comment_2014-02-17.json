A year later, I was prescribed the same opioid--but this time, due to pressure on physicians by law enforcement agencies and state medical boards, my dosage in the rehab center was half what it was the year before; as a result my pain returned sooner and was never completely controlled until I returned home and set my own medication and weaning schedule.

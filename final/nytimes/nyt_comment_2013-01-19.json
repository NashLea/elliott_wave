Their main goals are self-preservation, growth of endowment, and increase in salaries for management and administrator, similar to any other large corporation.  The economic power and income from some of their endowments dwarf any educational operation, leading to frequent disagreements between faculty and administration, demonstrating the divergence of their goals.  Any education that occurs is a minor PR effort, sophisticated advertising that gets them tax-free status, exemption from anti-trust laws, tax-free donation status.<br/>\n     They are wrong in our opinion (yours and mine) because we have a different model of what they are supposed to be, in our minds.  We don't think universities should be like that, which makes our difficulty greater-- if it were as simple as \"messed up\", it would be easier to change.  A mess can be cleaned up if all parties agree.

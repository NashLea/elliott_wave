People are not stupid just because they are unfamiliar with specialized jargon and, while Washington insiders probably think that terms like deficit and debt are as common as terms like income and expenses, for most people they are not nearly so familiar. How many people ever use the term \"deficit\" when describing their own financial situation? So this begs the question of why pollsters do not clearly define their terms when they ask their questions. It would seem that they want to create the impression that the public is generally ignorant. It is my experience that a pollster will not clarify the questions even when asked to because this might skew the results. Such a system may pass the rigorous tests of statistical significance, but hardly is effective if the goal is to learn what people actually know and think.

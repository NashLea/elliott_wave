Had this conversation taken place in a bodega it would have been quite normal to speak off the top of your head, though it showed a limited thinking capacity when it came to human nature. Bu this conversation was taking place in a higher education institution and in a program teaching courses on socio linguistics, a field dedicated to the formulation and codification of concepts. Obviously, this linguist was not up to the standards required to understand how language evolves and its relationship to power structures, much less able to work with Puerto Ricans students if this was his view of the given ethnic groups. Yet, there he was in a position where he has been hired as a leader on his file but unable to apply his knowledge to specific situations.

I'm also an Army veteran of Desert Storm, so I understand a variety of the objectivity concerns.<br /><br />I don't really agree with Hersh. Really, his statement covers anything - if a reporter covers a small town's board of selectmen, he/she gets to know them on a friendly basis and will probably feel bad if a story would jam them up. A reporter who can't be objective with soldiers probably can't be objective back home either.<br /><br />During my embeds, I had it much easier than someone like Hastings. My goal was to write stories about junior soldiers, which I would then freelance to their hometown newspapers - I was not chasing profiles of senior leaders. I was providing less 'news' and more 'color.'<br /><br />However, the goal was still to be truthful - obviously.<br /><br />In most/all cases, the average E-4 is perfectly happy to vent all day long - if I wanted to only print verbatim quotes, they could look pretty bad. My job, then, is ensure I provide CONTEXT - so a soldier might say \"I hate this, this is the stupidest mission in the stupidest country, and every minute I regret enlisting,\" BUT if they say it while on their 18th hour in full gear guarding a MRAP that got stuck in a road that the tow truck can't get down...well, what would you expect them to say?<br /><br />So in that example, that quote's perfectly fine. It doesn't put the soldier in a bad light, but a human light - if anything, the reader could relate to the event that much more because of COURSE he's complaining, and it's something the average civilian reader cannot conceive. So, hopefully, the reader appreciates the situation these men have found themselves in.<br /><br />But if I just quoted that in some random part of the story? Without the explanation of the stuck MRAP? Well, obviously I'm an (expletive of choice).<br /><br />So in Hasting's case, what was he supposed to do? They took him out drinking with them! That WAS the context. So should he ignore it? Be one of the guys? He's NOT one of the guys. He's never going to be one of the guys.<br /><br />None of the officers I talked with ever made the \"mistake\" of being disrespectful to higher command. They didn't put themselves in the position of McC's staff. Would I have done something with it it, if they had? Depends on the context - I'm not going to tailor an entire story just so I can justify using an otherwise out-of-context quote.<br /><br />The only thing a soldier ever explicity asked me not to use (other than security concerns) was a dirty joke.<br /><br />Now, I'm sympathetic, so I go back and forth on finding fault with Hastings. Part of me is like, \"come on, they took you out drinking, couldn't you be cool?\" But then another part is like, \"they took you out drinking? You gotta write that!\"<br /><br />In 2007, junior soldiers I met were bitter and cynical and happy to tell me so. We were in a JSS that was mortared every day, and they sat there and took it. It was absolutely horrible. They were not believers in the reconcilation mission and were confident we would fail. They looked at meetings over chai tea in the most bitter terms possible.<br /><br />From the stories I then wrote, a couple guys got in semi-trouble with their command for quotes, and for pictures w/unauthorized stuff on their uniforms.<br /><br />It wasn't serious trouble - but ANY trouble adds a level of stress to an already awful situation.<br /><br />I re-embedded with the same unit again, two years later, and saw some of those guys again.<br /><br />They then had the opportunity to tell me - right to my face - what they thought of me and the stuff I wrote. But - they all liked the stories, and they told me they liked them because what I wrote was true; if they got in trouble, they didn't mind, because it was their words and they were telling their own story.<br /><br />And, two years removed from the awful 2007 deployment, they could now see that the meetings they hated actually had positive developments, and they could put their experiences into their own more meaningful context. They stood by their earlier words, but now understood events from a different perspective.<br /><br />Soldiers (and I was one) appreciate the truth. The one thing I definitley fault Hastings for is not using the names of the guys he talked to...what, McC can take the fall, but not his staff? If you say it, stand by it. I don't respect anonymous sources in most government stories - especially from  sources speaking from power. It's a disgraceful, cowardly practice, really.<br /><br />Having said that, I was writing from a much more limiting perspective than Hastings. So I didn't have to make the same kind of compromises. So I'm judging - but I don't have his perspective, or know the context of his conversations.<br /><br />I understand Hersh's basic point, about writing objectively about the guys (and women) who are protecting an embed reporter. But, the same could be said for reporting on police and firemen. You either want to tell a true story based on facts, or you don't.

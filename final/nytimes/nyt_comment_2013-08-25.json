Newcomen's engine was about 5% efficient. <br/><br/>James Watt and Matthew Bolton revolutionized the world by upping the steam engine's thermal efficiency to about 10% with their separate condenser and continuously-heated cylinder.<br/><br/>By the 1880's the Corliss steam engine was still only 20% efficient. <br/><br/>But present-day gasoline engines in cars are even worse, about 12% thermally efficient in combined urban-highway driving cycles. Diesel engines are about 18%. <br/><br/>Modern combined-cycle power plants can approach an overal thermal efficiency of about 55%. <br/><br/>The only energy conversion devices more efficient than that are fuel cells, which, when run on hydrogen, can approach 70% efficiency.  <br/><br/>Reducing wasted energy is the constant occupation of all good engineers.

But in the long run the costs of burning fossil fuels and of nuclear energy are the unacceptable ones:  fossil fuels because they destroy the environment, and nuclear energy because it will poison the globe for millennia.  How could humans be so stupid as to create nuclear waste with no plan for what to do with it?  Even animals know not to foul their nests (don't defecate where you eat and sleep).<br/><br/>All energy on the Earth comes from the sun.  Some came years ago and was stored as fossil fuel or geo-heat.  More comes every year.  Currently we are using more than we harvest from annual sunshine so we're dipping into past reserves -- and using them up rapidly, at ever greater environmental cost.  We need to move towards a situation that is more in balance, ie where total energy use is closer to annual solar harvest.  That means increasing \"renewables\", yes, but it also means cutting total use, and I don't see us as likely to do that unless world population declines dramatically.<br/><br/>Are we serious?  I don't have the figures handy, but I remember a study that said the US could cut it's energy use significantly by two simple measures:  turning off lights that are not in use, and cutting speed limits to 45 mph.

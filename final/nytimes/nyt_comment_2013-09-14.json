Her article is a reminder to be' In the Moment' and being 'Mindful' with people and animals you love and care deeply for.<br/>Its  not about being a  privileged white girl or getting a dog from the shelter.  We all make mistakes in our lives and we have to say sorry to people/animals we have hurt and  this is her way of saying sorry to her beloved Bad/Good dog.<br/>Love your article Rachel and I deeply sorry for your pain.

Same concept with the mailman at the door. Dog is reacting from fear. The dog will keep repeating this behavior unless you teach them otherwise. Reinforce good behavior by teaching your dog to sit and stay and using treats. You can do this with anything your dog reacts to, just need to start far enough away and decrease the distance gradually. I got my dog at the shelter 4 years ago and she had no idea how to walk on a leash.

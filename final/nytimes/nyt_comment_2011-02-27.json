Col. Quaddfi did alot for his people. So did the Italian geographers and geologists, British petroleum interests, Aramco, etc. If he, as legitimate head of state of Libya, cannot put down a rebellion, the origin of which seems somewhat obscure, then what does that say about the countries and organizations which oppose his doing so. Do they act  in the interests of those aforementioned entities as though they were creditors foreclosing upon a long-due debt? Or is the answer more pragmatic? Again the question of the peculiar commodity looms large. Maybe he is an anachronism; all this pressure, if it continues, will surely make one of him.

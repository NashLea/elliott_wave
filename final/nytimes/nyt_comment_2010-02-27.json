The man is \"entitled\" to \"straighten out\" the woman or \"she was asking for it\" or it's \"a private matter.\" Just because laws have changed in the past 20 years doesn't mean attitudes have, especially among police.<br /><br />According to the audio tape of the woman's petition for a restraining order, the judge in the case observed that the woman -- who sounded terribly despondent or fearful on the tape -- had bruises on her arms. Obviously, this woman was physically abused by someone. But the State Police still thought it more important to protect a male aide to the governor than to protect a woman who was afraid for her physical safety. No wonder she didn't show up for her appointed hearing. A call from the governor, no matter how \"conciliatory\" or \"sympathetic\" he pretended to be, would set off alarm bells for any woman, especially one who had been \"counseled\" by State Police about her \"options.\"<br /><br />Any way you look at it, this was a terrible case of domestic abuse &amp; a worse case of an attempted cover-up of a violent crime against a woman in the presence of her child.<br /><br />That this particular governor has made the pretense of being a champion of victims of domestic violence is not just ironic. Because violence was involved, Gov. Paterson's hypocrisy exceeds that of the Larry Craigs &amp; David Vitters &amp; John Ensigns.<br /><br />In his press conference today, Paterson had the audacity to use his wife as a \"family values\" prop while he asserted he was doing a great job for New Yorkers.

We have taken in almost a million refugees since 9/11, I don't recall any banks being broken. Can you point to any fiscal hardships?

Not too much.  Much of this work is outsourced to groups like Catholic Charities and furniture, etc. is largely donated. The government resttlement period is six months and most charities do not help more than three or four months. I helped some families get settled through Catholic Charities, and the refugees I met were eager to jump in to American society, start working and start building their lives.  Many of them have family support or support among their ethnic group.  And the government gives each refugee less than a grand to get settled.<br/><br/>The bottom line: refugees are forced to flee.

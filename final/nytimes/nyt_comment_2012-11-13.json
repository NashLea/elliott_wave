I was lucky that my parents could afford to send me to an Ivy League college with minimal debt 15 yrs ago.  However, after 4 years of medical school, 6 years of residency and 0.5 years of fellowship, my alma mater is an interesting factoid of my life, but not much more than that.  My much younger sister is applying to college now, our parents are significantly older and with less earning power, and I've told her time and again it doesn't really matter where you go to college, as long as you avoid the trap of insane debt, pick a major with proven earning potential, and work hard wherever you go.  The farther you get from college, the more you realize that the name of your college simply isn't critical enough to risk your financial future and that of your parents.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there's intrinsic value in preserving and teaching liberal arts.  It would be a terrible shame to lose knowledge for practicality.  However, there's a reason I majored in biology and not linguistics, as much as I loved the latter subject.  I ran into my favorite linguistics teacher my sophomore year, and what was this Ivy League professor who knew 15 languages doing?  He'd resigned and begun working for the local pharmaceutical company as an English advisor to foreign employees.  If college were free, by all means major in Russian lit, but if you're taking on debt, you have to be practical.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3347469, "replies": [], "lft": 846, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/business/some-parents-shouldering-student-loans-fall-on-tough-times.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7638207, "rgt": 847, "userDisplayName": "Eugene Gorrin", "createDate": "1352782850", "userID": 55726510, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1352783508", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Union, NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1352783508", "commentSequence": 180, "commentBody": "Remember the advice Mittwit Romney offered a group of college students this past April: If you want to get an education or start a business, borrow money from your parents.<br/><br/>Romney, a wealthy former investment banker who has struggled to soften his image as a member of America\u2019s super elite, was discussing ways of achieving the American dream at Otterbein University.

It turned out to be more interesting than I expected.<br /><br />I grew up in Manhattan, in Washington Heights, but I\u2019ve spent most of my life living in Minneapolis.  We raised two daughters in our house in Minneapolis and now it\u2019s just us -  two 78 year old senior citizens living in a 2000 square foot house.  It\u2019s a nice house, built in 1922 in a very nice neighborhood of well kept homes.  A major feature of our neighborhood is a large, very popular city lake at the end of our block.  The main change to our neighborhood over the past 40 years has been the replacement of our huge elm trees with young maple trees.  There has also been a general upgrade of almost all of the houses.  As I said, this is a nice neighborhood, very attractive to families. The best elementary, Jr. high and high schools in Minneapolis just happen to be in our district.  A recent change is what we call \u201cturnover\u201d: couples with small children replacing old folks like us.  It happened when we moved in, it\u2019s happening now.  We are very pleased; it\u2019s fun to hear children again. The assessed value of the houses in our neighborhood runs between $600,000 and $800,000, with ours right in the middle.  Real estate taxes run from $5000 to $10,000 per year.  Minnesota State income taxes average about 60 to 70 per cent of federal taxes.  This is not an inexpensive state to live in.  But it\u2019s a very nice place to live, and it\u2019s our willingness to pay taxes that makes it so.  In terms of quality of life, neither NJ nor Brooklyn comes anywhere close.<br /><br />It was clear as I looked at the numbers that the cost of housing in NJ was higher, while the cost of living in the high rise in Brooklyn was lower.  We were right in the middle.  Using the old fashioned, but now fully vindicated, formula that housing should consume 30 to 40 per cent of income put us right in the $175,000 per year income class.  But I have never even dreamt of earning as much as $175,000 dollars per year.  What\u2019s going on here?  I know we live as well as any of our new neighbors.<br /><br />A look at the numbers and all becomes clear.  The numbers assume a family with children buying a home with a 20% down payment and a 30 year 5% loan.  Such a family has a mortgage and social security taxes to pay, a need for life insurance and has the costs of raising children.  They also need to set aside some earnings as savings.  My budget includes none of these.  We have no earned income, so no SS; we have no need for life insurance, no need for savings (actually, a third of our income comes from savings) and no children to raise.  But the big number is that we own our home; no mortgage expense.<br /><br />Try it. Just eliminating mortgage expense dramatically changes the picture.  The fact is, the ratios are real.  Eliminating mortgage expense implies reductions in other expenses as well.<br /><br />These numbers are real.  We actually spend around $70,000 a year to live; our new neighbors across the street with their two cute children really need $175,000 to live as well as we do.  These are the numbers that make retirement for the middle class possible.   As we are, others will be \u2013 including that nice family across the street.

Speaking from experience,child care/pre-school etc. costs much more in the city than in the suburbs. In many neighborhoods the park is an asphalt paved lot (and in the case of my old Queens school it is partially covered with trailers). I also found food prices to be higher in the city, though that is in part due to being unable to buy in bulk. Finally, once little ones showed up, we really stopped caring about bars and great restaurants, aside from child friendly ones, and started caring about a washer and dryer (or swing set) that we didn't have to take an elevator to and could use whenever we wanted. I'm not even going to start on the schools.<br /><br />There are trades every day and life and my wife practically took me screaming and kicking from our apartment.

I worked my tail off year round, was the grateful recipient of Pell Grants, more scholarships than I can count, and a University Fellowship at Syracuse.

I nabbed a tenure track position as a college professor at a large state research university in the midwest.  My starting salary in 1999 was $39,000/year.  Loan repayments choked me nearly to death.  I was able to defer them for seven years (while I struggled, in general, to pay my other bills) BUT THE 7% INTEREST CONTINUED TO ACCRUE.  Before I knew it, I owed ten thousand additional dollars in interest.  Currently, I am in good standing but for every $434 I pay each month only $82 goes to the prinicipal.  The rest just keeps my head above water in interest payments.  I am NOT interested in visiting bankruptcy court.  There must be a happy medium.

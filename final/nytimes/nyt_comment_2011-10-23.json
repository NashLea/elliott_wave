What exactly did you think was going to happen when you emigrated? You made your children Americans! They will always question authority and think as individuals.<br/><br/>Many American women find it difficult to report to Indian men in US corporations: They are spoken to in a patronizing or dismissive way. And the inverse is even more troublesome: Indian men having difficulty reporting to American female executives. This has set the equality movement in the US workplace back about 25 years.

My own inkling is that the carpet would remain at 20' even at infinite steps. I think there are three ways to support this perspective,<br/><br/>1. The magnification argument. Dr W makes this nicely in #65 and perhaps in #64: as the steps decrease in size you can just increase magnification correspondingly and always see the same picture. The carpet will therefore never change in size.<br/><br/>2. The larger staircase argument: instead of being confined to 10x10 feet you keep the steps the same size and allow the entire staircase to grow to infinite length. Carpet required for each step would remain at 2' even as steps reached infinity.<br/><br/>3. The break-the-steps argument. The initial ten stairs could each be broken into the step and the riser; connecting all risers then all steps would give you a ten foot vertical surface followed by ten feet of horizontal surface, which in total would require the same twenty feet of carpet. Even infinite steps could be reassembled into this configuration, therefore infinite steps continue to take the 20'.<br/><br/>I think the tricky thing in this problem is that if the original set of stairs would placed on a plank and continually subdivided the area between the stairs and plank would approach zero as the steps got smaller and smaller (Dr W's point, I believe).

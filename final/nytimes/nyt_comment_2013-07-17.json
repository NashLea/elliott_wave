Secrecy is a physical condition, and it no longer exists in our modern world. It existed to some degree by virtue of physical separation, when we were an agrarian society.

Digital technology makes everything available to everyone, images included. This can be delayed and thwarted to some degree, but in the end, anyone can acquire any data with a modicum of skill and motivation.<br/>   b. Data are valuable. There is simply too much money/power/control/ whatever in possessing data to be denied. It is the cocaine of the flat world.<br/>4. What can be done?<br/>   a. Accept reality, and stop wasting time pining for secrecy - it's impossible.<br/>   b. Make data less valuable or interesting where possible. Individual medical data loses value with community rating - when everybody pays the same for insurance no matter what, individual data have no value. Make your data uninteresting.<br/>   c.

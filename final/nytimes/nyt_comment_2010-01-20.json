There is a great chance that on January 20, 2012, Sarah Palin will be inaugurated President of the United States. And if you think there cannot be a repeat of Florida 2000 again, get real. Everything that happened then can happen again, and a lot worse, too.<br /><br />Palin was behind Barack Obama 20 points last summer. Now she is behind him 6 points. She is the favorite of conservatives, the dominant faction in the Republican Party. Now she has a program on Fox. There can be little doubt that she will be the Republican nominee in 2012.<br /><br />Seeing the complaints by so many liberals, and indeed the hard attacks on Obama by so many liberals, I am mystified. Do you really think he is the problem? Have you looked at Glen Beck lately? Have you looked at the \u201ctea baggers\u201d lately? They are extreme, vicious, violent, and growing.<br /><br />Political ideology, especially in its most extreme form, and advocated with great fervor, is a lot like addiction. It\u2019s irrational, and it cannot be addressed by rational argument. It\u2019s certainly an obsession to those who hold it. As Morris Berman said, \u201cAn idea is something you have; an ideology is something that has you.\u201d The problem is always some other group. The nation is threatened by enemies, within and without. Blame is always laid on others. Facts are disputed, distorted or denied to suit the agenda of the ideologue. (That is called denial.) The world abounds with conspiracies, all aimed against the ideology. No respect is shown for anyone whose viewpoint differs.<br /><br />I thought, after the Bush administration, the war in Iraq, starting with falsified evidence, over 100,000 killed, and a trillion dollars wasted, and the events of last fall, when our economy almost collapsed, that American had \u201chit bottom\u201d on the American conservative movement and the political right. I thought we had learned that we had to pay attention to reality, to facts, that we could not pray our way out of problems, that the world out there is not created by our desires, and that we do not create reality by our actions (as one member of the Bush administration said).<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Glen Beck advocates a fascist program. He has stated explicitly that he wants, \u201cto bring us all back to the place we were on September 12, 2001. The day after America was attacked we were not obsessed with Red States, Blue States or political parties. We were united as Americans, standing together to protect the greatest nation ever created.\u201d Bush had 91% approval ratings just after 9/11, but that does not mean that we as a nation had decided to stop thinking.<br /><br />The nation united as one, without differences, is the essence of fascism. It is the fascist ideology in a nutshell. It\u2019s inherent in the fascist symbol, the fasces, which derives from the Roman Empire. Pieces of wood were bundled together as one, to strengthen the bundle and hold an axe, for use as a weapon. Hitler and Mussolini were quite clear on this point.<br /><br />The ideologue will say or do anything to advance his ideology. He or she will attack the opposition by any means available. So, we liberals are \u201cnot real Americans.\u201d We are \u201ctraitors.\u201d \u201cLoyal to other countries.\u201d We are too \u201cintellectual,\u201d meaning that we don\u2019t fit in with the real America. In America today, we have people who seriously believe that Obama was not born in America, that he is a Muslim, or that he sides with other nations against our own.<br /><br />Another tactic that extremists use is to project their worst traits onto others. Hence you see Glen Beck\u2019s show running newsreels of the Third Reich, or posters of Obama with a Hitler mustache.<br /><br />Robert O.

The divide between rich and poor falls decisively along educational and societal lines, this divide has grown wider and continues to grow at a faster rate as the economic direction of the country accelerates into a technical and trade based economy. The greatest shift in personal wealth from the many to the few has taken place in the last thirty years in an ever increasingly technical society and the change in economic policies favoring the wealthy.<br />  This is just a small example of those left behind by failed educational policies and a culture that does not understand the monumental shift taking place. While the right focuses on \"culture wars\" fomented by they're wealthy backers as a distraction from reality and the left fumbles rudderless and clueless in the face of adversity the country suffers from a lack of will to take on the difficult core issues that plague us, and will for years to come.<br />    These people are the ones on the outside looking in with no clue as to where to start or how, they are just a small sampling of the permanent underclass we have created. Don't excoriate them for not possessing the skills and ability to climb out of the cycle of poverty they exist in when the tools and education to do so were never offered.<br />     If you started miles behind the poverty line, even getting to it is a difficult and daunting task, it takes generations to exceed it, then once on the ground floor real progress can be made. Education is the future, period, if we don't offer it to the widest segment of society in equal amounts we will be strangling our own future. Throwing stones at these families is like trying to make ourselves feel powerful by beating a person half our size, it's a hollow and shallow response to a growing problem.<br />    I speak from experience, I have worked my way from poverty to a very comfortable existence, one where I too have reached the level of income favored by the current finance and tax laws. Unfortunately I find many of my contemporaries spending too much energy attempting to keep others from attaining those same milestones, in the end it only hurts us all. What kind of society have we become? Is it one we can feel truly proud of?<br />    True humanity requires humility, a quality that seems out of place these days.

We are not responsible because our intentions wer good, well sort of good. History will assure that the world to come knows two things about us. We fueled the slave trade that de-populated Western Africa to the tune of maybe 40,000,000 and we created a human buchery machine in the land that Abraham left 3500 years ago that swallowed up a generation of Iraqi kids.

The people of that town surrounded the building and prayed for them much to the amazement of the foreign leaders. I think it would be good for those so led to form an invisible circle around these leaders and pray for peace.

Often I would have joined the most cynical commenters here. These maddening negotiations have failed the world again and again. But, we still must try to turn the cynicism off.<br /><br />Netanyahu and Abbas may not seem capable of achieving peace, but it must happen. There is no lasting peace for anyone in the Middle East and no demographic future for a Jewish Israel without it. And, now that we are engaged in Middle Eastern combat, we can not disengage until this peace is in effect. We will remain at war until this peace works.<br /><br />This is the Middle East and these negotiations will succeed when they have to. Not when we wished they would. Not when we wanted them. Not when we demanded them. Not even when we needed them to succeed. But, we are close to the time when they will have to work. The alternatives are becoming unthinkable and they are approaching.<br /><br />I've been a news junkie, since I was a kid and I've been ringside at this fight for nearly half a century. I've cheered and booed both sides and I've watched as an apolitical cynic. Something is happening that I've never seen before and it does't have a neat description.<br /><br />It's more of a feeling that things that must happen for peace must happen now or very soon or they will never happen. I am not alone in feeling that the place is here, the time is now and there won't be a later.<br /><br />When peace is made, it's usually made by weak flawed men who rise above themselves for the good of their people. Even then they must be forced to face themselves by strife and time and disillusion. We should pray in any religion we hold dear that Netanyahu and Abbas are the weak flawed men that will do this for us all. They will both have to yeild on many more points that will put their careers and lives in danger.<br /><br />While hope still lives , we should try not to bring our hatreds and cynicism to this peace table. It's a waste of time. The table is overflowing with both.<br />", "recommendationCount": 2}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

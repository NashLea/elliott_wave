To me, the reason why most Americans aren't all that concerned about climate change, or won't sacrifice to achieve it, are entirely rooted in their own personal economics. It's easy to support fuel taxes, for instance, if one lives in a place with enough density to take a train to work. Conversely, if one's economic situation dictates that one has to commute 50 miles to work each way, then the idea of raising fuel taxes because it will somehow delay global warming comes off like a kick in the teeth. So it's going to require more than moral scolding to actually do something about this: it will require concrete solutions across the board, and where any sacrifice is so widespread it doesn't seem like a direct hit to a person's wallet. For instance, if we want to cut down car traffic, we'll probably have to build a lot more housing in places (such as expensive suburbs) where zoning restrictions don't generally allow for it.  If we want everyone using power-sipping LED bulbs, we'll have to subsidize it (someone on relief may not find it easy to spend $80 on LED bulbs). Climate change is solvable - but only if most people realize benefits from the policies put in place, as opposed to being force-fed policies that come off as if they'll be the only ones to pay the price for them.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 3440562, "replies": [], "lft": 1005, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/science/intolerable-heat-may-hit-the-middle-east-by-the-end-of-the-century.html", "parentID": 16480681, "commentID": 16480899, "rgt": 1006, "userDisplayName": "Mike M.", "createDate": "1445916350", "userID": 14901733, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1445918759", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Chapel Hill, NC", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1445915159", "commentSequence": 16480899, "commentBody": "Kirk--so you're cool with mankind going through an apocalypse where some survive.

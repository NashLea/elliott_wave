First, what Wisniewski did has nothing at all to do with the post-lockout rules. I do think that some of what has occurred in the way of high speed hits does result from the absence of obstruction in that legal hits (as well as illegal hits) are more damaging than ever before. But I don't buy the notion that so much of the escalation in dangerous play is a consequence of the rules. I think it has something to do with the a greater degree of parity and having more at stake in the average game, which heightens the demands put on the players. Retaliation for perfectly clean body checks has nothing to do with the post-lockout rules.<br /><br />Second, and related to the previous point, I think that there is actually more checking, more body contact today than before the lockout, which is contrary to what lots of traditionalists believe.  Yes, the battles in front of the net -- which were very obvious and very entertaining -- are nothing like they used to be, but the lack of obstruction is causing much more body contact in open ice and along the boards. .<br /><br />Finally, I know it is also fashionable for traditionalists to blame the media for some sort of softening of the game but the change in the rules is something the GMs debate and advocate and I can assure you that is one group that is not greatly influenced by the media and whatever opinions are expressed in it. Additionally, the players have an increasing amount of say in the way the game is played and the rules through the NHLPA and on things like the Competition Committee. It is flattering to think that those of us who have opinions on the game carry some sort of weight in these matters but I tend to think we have far, far less impact than some believe.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1272146, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/n-h-l-scoreboard-bruins-beat-on-cooke-but-lose-badly/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1719116, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "kingfarouk", "createDate": "1268973584", "userID": 59984026, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268991093", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new york", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268987493", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Thornton's getting the better of Cooke in that one instance is hardly avenging the Bruins' honor.

But here's the stats, and take them for what they're worth. Playing for the Wild, Gaborik led or tied for the team lead in GWGs five straight years, including seasons when he missed significant games due to injury. In a sixth year, he finished second. Twice, he was among the top 10 in the NHL in GWGs.<br /><br />Once Jokinen developed into a consistent scorer, he led the Panthers in GWGs four straight years and finished second in the fifth.<br /><br />In all these seasons, these two players were most often the leading scorer on their respective clubs<br /><br />GWG's is not always a precise stat, but I think these stats does indicate that that these two played essential roles in whatever success their teams had.

Sure we can't compete with some of developing nations, but it would be very difficult to increase productivity. We have already reduced wages, especially when you combine them with increased productivity. Many, many salaried workers have had wages cut and have been required to do the jobs of two or more people. When you have one worker doing the job of two, that means wages have technically been cut in half. Insofar as retail workers are concerned, wages have remained stagnant while workers are doing more work in less time with hours being cut and benefits being slashed or done away with all together. Again, a form of lowering wages. All of this is happening while many companies post record profit after these same companies destroyed our economy with devious business practices.<br/><br/>There isn't much more workers can do.  Working more for less money just isn't going to make a majority of us richer. It's going to make us poorer and more stressed out while the top 10% keeps raking it in. We have to find away to wrestle some of the money away from the top 10% and funnel it back down to the middle and lower classes so we can put it back into the economy, create demand, which creates more jobs, etc... Trickle down has been nothing but a dismal failure, so trickle up is really the only major option left.

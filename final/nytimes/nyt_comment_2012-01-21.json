What a wuss!  Sorry folks, but that is a form of child abuse we should never tolerate in any elected official, let alone the President of the United States.  Newt had no regard for how he treated his wives, and has less regard about how he treats his daughters.  In this sense, he would have no regard in abusing any power handed to him in an election.

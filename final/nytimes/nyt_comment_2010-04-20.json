If you consider the reduced tax rates for investment income and that  the wealthy pay no income or social security taxes on their large tax-free accounts and on unrealized capital gains, you see how labor income can end up being taxed at rates 5-10 times investment income and gains.  This economic distortion and our ongoing wealth concentration creates  a situation in which  too much investment money chases too few worthy investments ... bubble...burst.....recession, in which the poor and middle class end up suffering the most.  An alternative would be to do away with taxes on investment income and gains and instead tax wealth directly.<br /><br />[A VAT, especially one that replaces all or part of income taxes, will do just the opposite. The poor middle class spend almost all their income, so they get almost all their income taxed.  The very wealthy spend a small part of their income and so they get only that small part of their income taxed.]<br /><br />The cry will go up that investment and a wealthy investing class is needed to create jobs. (Supply side trickle down.)  Look at recent history:<br /><br />In 1993 under President Clinton, taxes on upper incomes were increased. Many Republican congressmen predicted this would lead to a recession, \"kill jobs,\" and so increase the federal deficit. There are many influences on the economy. That said, this tax increase on the rich was followed by:  the US's longest peacetime economic expansion; the creation of 23 million new jobs in eight years';  an increase in the median household income by $6000 over eight years; high tax revenue, elimination of the federal deficit, the first surpluses in 40 years; and low inflation.<br /><br />In 1997 President Clinton signed a law giving investment gains favored tax treatment over income from work. Perhaps this economic distortion contributed to the \"irrational exuberance\" dot-com stock market bubble. That bubble burst 4 years later, which in turn contributed to the 2001-03 recession. Two-thirds of President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts went to the top 5% incomes earners. They gave further favored tax treatment to the investing class. He said the cuts would stimulate the economy, create jobs, and so increase tax revenue. His tax cuts for the rich were followed by: a choppy economy (average GDP growth a low 2.5%); only 3 million new jobs (1/8th of Clinton &amp; the lowest rate among last 11 presidents); widening economic disparity between poor and rich; a decrease in the median household income by $1000 over eight years; a large drop in tax revenue with doubling of the national debt; and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930's.<br /><br />For more see:  <a href=\"http://fairsharetaxes.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://fairsharetaxes.org</a>", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1382466, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/obama-raises-funds-for-boxer-d-n-c/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1874261, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "wied0038", "createDate": "1271735183", "userID": 33358096, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1271736741", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Francisco", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1271733141", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "The San Francisco Chronicle is quoting a pool report stating that the President's remarks were interrupted by protesters urging the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" I certainly think it's relevant to the story. <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=61678&amp;tsp=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sfgate.com...</a> ", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1379754, "replies": [], "lft": 90, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/reduction-is-theme-of-presidents-next-act/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1874262, "rgt": 91, "userDisplayName": "CBWHITE", "createDate": "1271735207", "userID": 35424288, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1271736741", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Houston, Texas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1271733141", "commentSequence": 38, "commentBody": "Anatomy of a Clean-up Man \u2026Take #1.<br /><br />First and foremost, it\u2019s a messy job, but someone had to do it.

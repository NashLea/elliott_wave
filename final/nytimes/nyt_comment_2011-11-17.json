Most Americans rightly decry our country's malaise yet look to China with wide-eyed fascination, without any clue as to what the country is like.<br/><br/>China is not some benign country with no intention to bully its neighbors or curtail our interests in the region.  In the past few years it has used its economic and military clout to confront its neighbors, from South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, to Vietnam, in a series of provocative territorial skirmishes, many of which have cost the lives of the citizens of our allies in the region.<br/><br/>This move is exceptionally modest; 2,500 Marines is not a large force and is not likely to cost much.  It is not a grand realignment of US forces, nor does it entail expansion of the \"military industrial complex,\" whatever that nebulous concept may be.<br/><br/>Over 5 trillion in trade is conducted through the region's sea routes, with over 1 trillion owing to US trade.  The area is of vital commercial interest to our economy, and sending a signal that we intend to protect our economic interests is needed. <br/><br/>In the past few years nearly all of our allies, from Singapore, Australia, to Japan have requested an increased military presence in the region.  Even countries not aligned to us have driven home the point that they want a stronger US presence.  This presence is not some new development, anyone familiar with Australia or the Philippines knows that the US once stationed troops in the region and once had a stronger presence, in just the last decade.<br/><br/>The US needs to reassert its Asian presence, both through the use of increased diplomacy, as SOS Clinton has admirably done, and to reorganize its military presence to leave a symbolic mark.   The debate is whether or not this move is the right decision, not that it signals an intent to vastly expand military  power.

The evidence also makes it clear that once an individual is obese, it is very difficult for them to lose that weight permanently. The vast majority do not succeed in losing the weight and of those that do, most regain it within a few years. Complicating the issue further is the fact that the scientific evidence also indicates that very mild weight loss for the obese (~7-8% body mass) can have very positive effects on other aspects of their health, and that it might not even be necessary for them to lose it all. Finally, some obese people have genuine metabolic disorders or gain the weight as a side effect of medications for other illnesses. My concern is that a company policy that penalizes the obese with increased penalties will not take into account the complexity of the issue.<br/><br/>I'm fine with higher penalties for smokers, but not the obese. A better strategy to paying for the increased health costs of obesity would be taxes on soda and juice.

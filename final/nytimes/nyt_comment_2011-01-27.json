I am not clear if they are two separate conditions or if one actually causes the other.<br /><br />I agree that hair loss can be devasting when you're young and female. My first bout left me with a perfectly round bald patch the size of an egg on the upper back of my head. For many months, until it was completely grown back in (had cortisone injections), I rigorously applied a set of bobby pins to hold my remaining hair in place to cover up the spot. The second bout was a host of diffuse spots that were not noticeable without moving my hair. I consider myself lucky.<br /><br />Last year I had chemo and lost every hair on my body, but at 50 (and after everything else I've been through with lupus), it wasn't so hard to deal with.

Planes need expensive high purity fuels, and with oil prices going ever higher, the sky evermore crowded, and commuting traffic to and from airports increasingly bogged down and expensive, the financial drawbacks will rapidly be reduced and prospects for train travel enhanced in view of the convenience and hassle free environment it provides. Fuel efficient cars will help the cost aspects, but the ever increasing traffic and slowing down of new highway construction will make commuting nearly intolerable. And forget about electric cars, the first few million will be OK, but we don't have the power generation and distribution structure to accommodate the tens of million of cars needed to even make a moderate impact on our oil consumption ( I guesstimate we probably have in excess of 150 million or more cars and trucks on the US highways).

I am sure the victims of that conflict feel assured that the NYT corrected the record.  You should be embarrassed by that whole paragraph.  Again, self-serving.<br />But it's ok because you stood up to GWB on warrantless wire-tapping, in his own office no less.  Huh, I bet Assange has never been in the White House.

The NYT preaching to us once again about its high moral journalistic standards. (\u201cI\u2019m the first to admit that news organizations, including this one, sometimes get things wrong.\u201d) What a laughable understatement! Do you really think we\u2019re do dumb that we\u2019ve so quickly forgotten how culpably wrong you were and so recently on the Weapons of Mass Destruction? How gung-ho you were on the invasion of Iraq? And ask us to forget historically all those years the NYT spent pimping for the deluded Henry Kissinger (who can forget  his incriminating self-description to Oriana Fallaci as John Wayne, the sheriff facing down the bad guys all alone on Main St.)  while he installed murderous  military juntas from Saigon to Santiago, to El Salvador? Do you think we can forget how you so quickly sold out your own reporter Ray Bonner to the Reagan administration on the 1981 El Mozote Massaacre\u2026the list is long, dark and venal, Mr. Keller.  So c\u2019mon,  we all know you\u2019re making a ton of money off Assange and WikiLeaks and really that\u2019s what is all about. And in that your\u2019re no better than Rupert Murdoch. So lay off  the trashy fashion notes on Assange transformed from  a \u201cbag lady\u201d to trendy dresser and  \u201ca kind of cult figure for the European young and leftish\u201d (what a snide small-town put down that conveniently leaves out all the youth of North America who admire Assange.)  Find some humility in your situation. And just try not to screw it up too badly this time.<br />P.S. Oh, yeah..and thanks for the laugh about Assange being \"arrogant'\".

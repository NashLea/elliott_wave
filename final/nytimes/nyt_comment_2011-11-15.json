Perhaps you either need to get out more or think more before writing these posts.<br/><br/>I also object to you labeling of liveable streets advocates as the bike lobby. Go ahead and have a look at what TA and Streetsblog have done and have lobbied for (BRT expansion, ped plazas, traffic calming, sidewalk widening, neckdowns, ped refuges, safe routes to school, safe streets for seniors, fighting service cuts, fighting fare hikes, a long hard fight for congestion pricing). These are off the top of my head, I could go on an on. Yes, advocating for bicycles is a part of that, including opposing measures that have been shown to dramatically reduce cycling. In a few cases those organizations have lobbied for ped improvements that come at the expense of cyclists. Times Square was a prime example of that, and I dare you to find a single instance of Streetsblog or TA doing anything but lending their full and unwavering support of that project. I also dare you to find a single instance of a cyclist describing how much nicer it is to bike through Times Square now. Sure, there are a lot of cyclist involved in those organizations, and cycling has been a big issue recently. However, calling them strictly bike organizations, and lamenting the notion that NYC doesn't have a ped organization is simply disingenuous.<br/><br/>I appreciate the historic perspective that you brought with this article, but I think your rhetoric serves to add fuel to flames, rather than begin real dialogue.

The Dhaka declaration accepts a low-carbon future for their economies which is a crime against humanity. The coming climate catastrophe that this is supposed to prevent  is a pseudoscientific delusion. The last IPCC report predicted warming of 0.2 degrees per decade for this century. We got zero warming for 13 years. Comes from using climate models that are invalid. Ferenc Miskolczi has shown, using NOAA weather balloon database that goes back to 1948, that the transmittance of the atmosphere in the infrared has been constant for the last 61 years. Carbon dioxide at the same time increased by 21.6 percent. This means that addition of all this carbon dioxide had no effect whatsoever on the absorption of IR by the atmosphere. And no absorption means no greenhouse effect, the foundation stone of IPCC models. If you look further you realize that no observations of nature exist that can be said to verify the existence of geeenhouse warming. Satellites show that within the last 31 years there was only one short four year spurt of warming. It started in 1998, raised global temperature by a third of a degree, and then stopped. It was oceanic, not greenhouse in nature. The only other warming in the twentieth century started in 1910 and stopped with World War II. Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg sees it as caused by solar influence. He is probably right because you cannot turn carbon dioxide on and off like that. Between these two warmings temperature went nowhere while carbon dioxide kept going up. This leaves just Arctic warming to explain. It started suddenly at the turn of the twentieth century, after two thousand years of cooling. It cannot be greenhouse warming because carbon dioxide did not increase in synch with it. This covers the last one hundred years and as required by Miskolczi no warming within this time period can be called a greenhouse warming.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 3290598, "replies": [], "lft": 46, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/complexity-and-climate-extremes/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4885069, "rgt": 47, "userDisplayName": "Wang Suya", "createDate": "1321323594", "userID": 40342008, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1321334040", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Japan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1321334040", "commentSequence": 22, "commentBody": "I  think that climate confusion could not avoid by just aids.

Negligible means negligible and \"relatively small compared to natural variability\" means something else.  Black's quoted the report as  using \"relatively small\" and S. Fred wrote negligible.  The difference is important.<br/>\nYou may take comfort in the fact that the sign for the next 20-30 years will be uncertain because of the relatively small signal of AGW over that time frame compared with natural variability.<br/>\nBut if you had honestly reported on the rest of the BBC report, you would have noted that as the century progresses and GHGs accumulate, then the report projects that:<br/>\n    \"It is very likely that the length, frequency and/or intensity of warm spells, including heat waves, will continue to increase over most land areas...<br/>\n    \"It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls will increase in the 21st Century over many areas of the globe...<br/>\n    \"Mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is likely to increase...<br/>\n    \"There is medium confidence that droughts will intensify in the 21st Century in some seasons and areas...<br/>\n    \"Low-probability high-impact changes associated with the crossing of poorly understood thresholds cannot be excluded, given the transient and complex nature of the climate system.\"<br/><br/>These projections are pretty much what has been discussed since IPCC AR4 came out in 2007.

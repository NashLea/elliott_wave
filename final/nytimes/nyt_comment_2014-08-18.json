That money, when first loaned would have been \"printed\" by the lending banks, (not the Fed) and thus put into circulation  -- added to the money supply.<br/>In this scenario we would be facing a monetary contraction of $5 trillion per year.  Seeing this, the Fed decides to counteract this loss of money supply by making its own loans -- buying treasuries (Lending to the treasury). So what they do is perfectly rational, stepping in to lend (create money) when the banks stopped doing so and thereby maintaining (not increasing) the normal money supply.<br/>They are \"easing\" ( the opposite of tightening) the \"quantity\" (supply) of money  (hence \"quantitative\") to counteract the non-lending banks quantitative tightening.<br/>All banks \"print\" money. The cash printed by the Fed in the form of Federal Reserve Notes is a relative drop in the bucket of the total supply of \"money\". Lending is what creates-- \"Prints\" as skeptics call it-- most of the money there is.

Salient issues, such as solving the tax code, cannot be solved by a single sentence you post as a comment on an article. As a science degree holder you must know it requires empirical data:  <br/><br/>Usok, if you really believe that a simple flat tax minimum of income of 50,000 would be the panacea to the tax problem, you should seriously reconsider your position. Setting a 50,000 income would have a tremendous regressive nature that would eliminate any minimal, basic progressive nature that a tax code  must have. The top-income bracket would not pay any sizable proportion of their income for revenue, while in contrast the middle to low would be be burdened with a extremely larger proportion of their income.

Faced with that reality, Republicans are doing whatever they can to gin up \"voting fraud\" controversies so that they can limit voting among Democratic leaning populations.  <br/><br/>Conservatives have engaged in numerous efforts to try to suppress the Democratic vote, including:<br/><br/>    * Caging, which involves sending letters marked \u201cdo not forward\u201d to voters, compiling a list of all of the letters that are returned as undelivered, and then challenging the voters on that list when they show up to vote.  This approach ignores the fact that the letters might be undelivered because of a mistake in the address list, or because the voter is a college student or in the military, rather than because of a problem with the voter\u2019s qualification to vote.  The tea party and other conservatives were found to be planning a major caging effort in Wisconsin for the 2010 election, and caging has been carried out by Republicans in Florida, Ohio, Philadelphia, and other areas in the 2008 and 2004 elections.<br/><br/>    * Misinformation \u2013 There has been a long string of examples of information targeting Democratic or minority voters with misinformation designed to reduce their voting.  Such misinformation includes phone calls announcing that polling places have been moved or fliers informing people of the wrong election day or that people with unpaid traffic tickets will get arrested if they try to vote.  Such misinformation targeting Democratic or minority voters was found to be \u201cwidespread and deliberate\u201d in the 2006 elections in Virginia, and an organization known as Womens\u2019 Voices has engaged in such misinformation campaign in numerous states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and North Carolina.<br/><br/>    * Polling Place Challenges \u2013 Polling places in urban areas (which tend to be heavily Democratic), often have too few voting booths, leading to long lines that can discourage voters.  These lines are made even longer by deliberate efforts to conservatives to challenge the qualifications of virtually every voter that shows up, with the intent of discouraging both the challenged voter and people who leave the line after staying in it for a few hours.<br/><br/>While Republicans attempt to justify such voter suppression efforts on the grounds that there is purportedly widespread voting fraud occurring, a five-year long investigation by President Bush\u2019s Department of Justice found \u201cvirtually no evidence of any organized effort\u201d to fraudulently impact federal elections and other analyses have similarly found no evidence of fraud.  <br/><br/>In other words, this latest GOP legislative effort is a \"solution\" in search of a problem.  One has to wonder what it says about today's GOP that so much of their electoral strategy relies on restricting the number of people who get to vote. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 471}, {"assetID": 2671311, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/opinion/27wed1.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3741191, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Marvi C.", "createDate": "1303871785", "userID": 39599569, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303878718", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Pottstown, PA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303875118", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "What are these republicans afraid of?

Another way insurers can control costs is by attempting to select healthy customers that are least likely to pose risk.<br/><br/>This is standard operating procedure with most kinds of insurance, with insurers actually refusing to provide coverage - be it life insurance, flood insurance or until recently, health insurance to people who represented great risk.<br/><br/>Even with laws preventing insurers from discriminating against sick people, there is no motive to actually provide high levels of service to people who are going to cost more than they pay in premiums. Thus the need for some serious regulations requiring insurers to cover the same set of services or have insurers get extra reimbursement for taking sicker people, as is done in Europe.<br/><br/>I don't know what rules, if any, there are regarding deductibles, but via deductibles, insurers can effectively charge more to people with preexisting conditions.<br/><br/>In short, I think your hopes for competition providing greater value at lower cost are somewhat misguided.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3349124, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7736000, "replies": [], "commentID": 7740187, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "don a", "createDate": "1354034965", "userID": 42447319, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1354053460", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Timeout", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "MPLS, MN", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1354053460", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "My Latin is rusty but  I think it's - Habeo Deum ergo sum."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7736000, "replies": [], "commentID": 7741238, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "don a", "createDate": "1354041620", "userID": 42447319, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1354053461", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Timeout", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "MPLS, MN", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1354053461", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "So then are we to be simply - god's petri dish."}]}, "lft": 1258, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/an-imperfect-god/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7736000, "rgt": 1263, "userDisplayName": "Timeout", "createDate": "1353992837", "userID": 63329137, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1353992896", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Pct,AZ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1353992896", "commentSequence": 364, "commentBody": "So many thoughts about a \"perfect\" God, and why?

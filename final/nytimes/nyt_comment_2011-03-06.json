The brilliance of the Obama Administration's approach in Egypt and Tunisia is that our President cast off the old way of doing business.  In the face of popular uprisings against dictators in those two countries, President Obama neither became a saber rattling cheerleading spouting off about \"regime change,\" nor attempted to prop up the dictators in the name of security.  Instead, President Obama overruled his advisers, and ignored critics on both the left and the right, and decided to stake a public position in support of the will of the people of those countries, and to privately use diplomacy to curb any inclination by the governments of Egypt and Tunisia to violently crush those uprisings.<br /><br />I agree that we need to find a way to implement a similar approach in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Unfortunately, the Obama Administration's decision to step up drone attacks in Pakistan and to increase troop levels in Afghanistan were the wrong things to do.  Those approaches simply prop up corrupt dictatorships and further alienate and anger the people of those countries.  Instead, we need to make clear that we will strike at any terrorist organizations that pose a serious direct threat to us, but also reduce our military presence in both Afghanistan and Pakistan and shift our focus to supporting the will of the people in those countries.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.facebook.com...</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 164}, {"assetID": 2483083, "replies": [], "lft": 24, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/opinion/06friedman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3483416, "rgt": 25, "userDisplayName": "Jim S.", "createDate": "1299371370", "userID": 12433842, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299397266", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Cleveland", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299397266", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "But after the corrupt crony capitalist Arab regimes are replaced, what will remain?

There is no reason today for the United States of America to support - to the tune of hundreds of thousands of troops and $110 Billion - such egregiously corrupt regimes as those in power in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  At the same time we are bolstering these Near Eastern countries with money we desperately need here at home to rescue our failing American economy, we are lauding the Arab revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt,and many other Mediterranean rim Arab countries where the saber rattling and cries for democracy and freedom can be heard from Tahrir to Jordan.  The writing is on the wall. Mene, mene, tekel, Upharsin (\"we have been judged and found wanting\").<br /><br />Bloody civil war is taking place today in Libya under the mad despot, Ghaddafi. That Ghaddafi ordered the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, that Ghaddafi engineered the release of Al-Megrahi, the convicted bomber on death's doorstep in the UK a few years ago (the terrorist has not not yet shuffled off this mortal coil, let's hear it for miracles), are reasons enough for a coalition of willing forces to forcibly pluck the lunatic Colonel off his perch in Tripoli. Is there no one on this earth who can bell the crazy Libyan cat?  Is there no one who can scream \"the emperor's naked as a jaybird!\" about the treasury of US monies being poured down the money pits of Afghanistan and Pakistan for no reason at all?  What a strange world and in what strange times we are living, Dr. Friedman!  Would that your words would resonate in the Administration's wisest brains and spur our powers-that-be into action to rescue the Libyan people from their demented ruler and rescue the America people from paying taxes that are being poured into bloody unending war and corruption in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Hopefully the realities of the present day surprising and exciting turns of history (cf Tahrir Square) will force America to rethink and redirect her antidiluvian foreign policy, and bring those 110 Billion Dollars back home to do some good in America, instead of doing bad and worse in those two miserable and moribund countries we have been propping up for too long.

As a result, the army and its favored child, ISI have been able to create and nurture the impression that they are the only ones that have interest of the country at heart. The politicians are not just corrupt they are incompetent and disorganized. So any uprising that occurs in Pakistan will be against the regime of the day. The army will then proceed to engineer the installation of another puppet government. Needless to say they will ensure that the new regime is 'democratically elected'.

But that was then, in the Cold War.<br/><br/>As McPhee reported, Taylor saw the big picture and realized that nuclear proliferation could not be enforced by secrecy, since any competent nuclear physics graduate student, with financial backing, could build a primitive \"gun-type\" weapon (the Hiroshima bomb).  By controlling access to special nuclear materials, many countries (and a number of other groups) could be prevented from building devices that, although likely to fizzle, would cause radioactive damage and mass hysteria.  He was able to convince the US government of this, and the US carried the ball further into international agreements.<br/><br/>This book is not for the technological elite, although the reader will learn what the title means, a thing to know.  It's more about people and processes at the time that McPhee wrote the book in 1974.

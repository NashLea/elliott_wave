The author is factually correct that a mother should never leave her child so early. Not to be a pedant, but I highly suspect it's stasistically correct that 99.9% of the time children are \"unharmed\" when left at daycares or at the care of others in scenarios similar to the one described by Karl's mother. \"Harm\" is wideranged from extreme cases like Karl's to something \"innocuous\" like minor scratches here and there from diper changes or other things. So it's more than you think.<br/><br/>Also, women (or rather mothers) are natural caretakers because the survival of children depends on them and their nursing (and also their instincts) and when work or anything comes between this (required) nursing it's really a problem. <br/><br/>The issue is really this: should a mother (or I suppose father in a reversed role, if the mother earns more or is 'bread winner'), HAVE to leave her child with someone else in the name of trying to pay bills. My answer is no...a mother should have the existential right to choose between taking care of her children or working. Or both (which is what many 'choose', or are forced to choose; unfortunately with terrible consequences at times). <br/><br/>So when the choices don't really exist, then yes, we must ask the next question: what is it about our culture or society, or way of life in general that deprives our women from having this fundamental choice?", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 3441949, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10336", "parentID": null, "commentID": 16678660, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Ben", "createDate": "1447650025", "userID": 65824742, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1447650069", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": 65824742, "userLocation": "<br/>", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1447650069", "commentSequence": 16678660, "commentBody": "Seared the outside for a little more flavor before rubbing in the herb mixture and poaching.

As a gullible young man I bought into it 100%.<br /><br />Somewhere around 32 I came to realize those little engagements were agenda driven drivel. All movements target the youth as they have not lived long enough to understand that many are misled or agenda driven. The other odd thing about all those engagements was they always tended to be on the pessimistic side. Of course it's easy to be pessimistic.<br /><br />My parents never talked to us about these types of things so me and my siblings were a bit unprepared to say the least. If you are old enough to know then you know in the 60\u2019s &amp; 70\u2019s the attempts to \u201cengage the youth\u201d were rife on all sides. There was much open talk of molding our youth. It is tough to do as few remained molded as the engagers envisioned.<br /><br />My offspring and my sibling\u2019s offspring are far more aware than me and my siblings were. After our young mass media onslaught we learned that there was a need to teach them to be skeptical of those that would seek to engage them.<br /><br />I know skeptical on this forum is a derogatory term but the opposite is gullible. I think you will find the bulk of today\u2019s youth much less gullible.<br /><br />Perhaps you should concentrate more on us that are getting older as our mental capacities fade me may be more gullible and easier to engage. We will certainly be more receptive to dooms day scenarios as we will be facing them head on.<br /><br />Not sure about anyone else but I was bullet proof when young. I wanted everything to be fair because it wasn\u2019t clear that can never be the case, for instance.  There are of course countless other examples of the workings of our young minds. One of the ones that I have the fondest memories of is LBJ\u2019s Great Society to eliminate poverty in our time.  The reason is that I was exposing the virtues of this to my dad. He gave me that look that always said \u201cyou haven\u2019t thought this through\u201d. Being older and wiser though he didn\u2019t try and explain it to me instead he made the comment \u201cson some people want to be poor\u201d. Needless to say I didn\u2019t buy that but it made me think. Guess you could say he engaged me. So in the end of that process I realized that it was his way of letting me discover for myself that you cannot drive other people to success.

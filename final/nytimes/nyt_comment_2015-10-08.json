There is no reason why it is a given right. Last Saturday in usually peaceful Toronto a confrontation between a rowdy party crowd and the police broke out at the annual art festival Nuit Blanche. The police was outnumbered by the riotous mob. Several officers were injured. China\u2019s security police faces similar hazard, but many times more dangerous because their crowds are so much larger.

To secure the right to \"bear arms\" for all (male) citizens was an important statement about the organization of the new, republican form of government. It had NOTHING to do with personally owning a gun. At the time, in a largely agrarian society, guns were a common tool; one would no more enshrine the right to own one in the founding document of the nation than one would enshrine the right to own a shovel. That an agenda-driven court has decided otherwise changes the law, but it doesn't change the fact. No one would read that phrase that way in that period in any other context--it's as bad a one-off decision as Bush v Gore, and at least as pernicious. Hypocritical too, since the same justices who wanted that outcome were committed to something they pretend to call \"originalism,\" so they had to make up a fraudulent reading of the phrase to adhere to that (equally misguided) doctrine.

For starters, it's not like Brewer was taking a massive amount of outside shots.  Based on your chart, he essentially shoots as many outside shots as the league average.

He was forced to be a 1st or 2nd option and that's not who he is.  Just look at what he did at the Univ of FL.  He's at his best when he's asked to be an offensive contributor rather than the focal point.  He was badly mis-used at Minn and his stock fell b/c of it.<br /><br />Brewer's body is long and he's a quick, agile SF by NBA standards.   He's a model specimen for D'Antoni's system.  The knock on him is he can't shoot, but he does everything else well.   Considering the fact that 3 of the Knicks starting 5 have no problems taking 15 shots a game, is it really so bad to have a guy like Brewer playing defense, getting boards and looking to slash?

The amount of stress and work that is put on each and every teacher to \"teach\" someone else's child to be an upstanding citizen, while also teaching important subject matter, is not an easy task.

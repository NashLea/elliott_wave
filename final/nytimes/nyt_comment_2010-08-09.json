Joe Romm and Gavin Schmidt are widely respected in the scientific community, and their attention to detail and devotion to accuracy is well known.  They are also quite open about publicly acknowledging their own occasional errors, which is the hallmark of good scientists.  Your labeling them as propagandists is just name-calling, with no basis in fact.<br /><br />The question of whether the emails were hacked is immaterial to the validity of climate science.  The main point is that the emails reveal nothing other than the normal ebbs and flows of vigorous debate and the frustrations of scientists who were being harassed by people who kept bringing up long-debunked talking points over and over again.   I\u2019d be annoyed too if I was faced with those people all the time, although I\u2019d be more circumspect about how I expressed my frustration than were some of the scientists responsible for those emails.<br /><br />And the fact that Joe Romm refers to \u201chackergate\u201d is irrelevant to whether his scientific arguments make sense (they do).  You simply can\u2019t infer that Climate Progress is a \u201cjoke\u201d from Joe\u2019s use of that term.    Joe has a Ph.D. in physics from MIT, and he knows his stuff (although he can sometimes be quite flamboyant in his choice of language).<br /><br />Nature and Science are the two most respected scientific journals in the world.  You may not like Nature\u2019s use of the term \u201cdenialist\u201d in Nature\u2019s op-ed, but that use of language is separable from the substantive points that op-ed made.  The emails revealed nothing of consequence about the science, and you should focus on those arguments, not on a semantic argument about whether the term \u201cdenialist\u201d somehow links those disagreeing with climate science to people who deny the events of the Holocaust took place.<br /><br />The quotation from Gene Gordon is an accurate description of some of the limitations of peer review.  Like all human processes it is imperfect, and I would never claim otherwise.  But over time, peer review weeds out beliefs and statements that are inconsistent with reality. The rewards system in the scientific community and the personality traits of most scientists consistently push towards more accurate descriptions of the physical world.<br /><br />And the weight of peer-reviewed evidence comes to bear when scientific bodies (like the National Academy of Sciences or the IPCC) summarize that evidence in periodic reports.  That review literature, while also imperfect, does its best to summarize the preponderance of the evidence, and right now that evidence all points towards the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere being \u201ca serious problem that will not solve itself\u201d, in the words of the Yale economist William Nordhaus.<br /><br />As far as the investigations of the \u201cemail incident\u201d, I haven\u2019t heard of any credible organization that has investigated those emails finding that there was anything there.  That includes the independent work of the AP (  <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=9319400\" target=\"_blank\">http://abcnews.go.com...</a> ).

It is one thing to believe that technological innovation will increase our ability to understand and fix problems over time, and will do so rapidly, assuming there are no discontinuous disruptions of human civilization (N.B., such disruptions are a possibility that we cannot discount).   But there are strong reasons to believe that our technological prowess will not increase at a rate sufficient to fix the climate problem after the fact, and that it will be cheaper and easier to avoid that problem in the first place.<br /><br />First, technological prowess is both a source of solutions and a source of problems. So the fact that human knowledge increases rapidly cuts both ways\u2014it both increases our ability to solve problems and our ability to mess things up.  Simon had FAITH that our knowledge of solutions will accrue more rapidly than we create problems, but just because it has arguably been true for many such problems in the past does not imply that it will always be true in the future.<br /><br />And the fundamental reason to doubt Simon\u2019s extreme optimism is that it\u2019s easier to make changes in technological and environmental systems than to foresee the consequences of those changes. Our understanding of causal links and feedback loops will always lag behind our ability to alter them, as David Bella points out:<br /><br />\u201c...changes can be accomplished one at a time as if they were essentially in isolation from each other.  Moreover, only a small part of the environment and only a few environmental properties must be understood in order to produce a change.  In contrast, to foresee the consequences of change requires that one examine the combined effect of many changes (Bella 1979).\u201d<br /><br />Second, waiting until consequences occur can be dangerous because of the irreversibility of important technology-related environmental effects.  Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for about 100 years, which means our actions in the next few decades will affect the world for many decades yet to come. In such a world, \u201cwait and see\u201d is a very dangerous game.  As I said above:<br /><br />\u201cHumans are affecting the climate now, but the real worry is what happens in the future as humans get richer and more numerous.  Any reasonable estimates of GDP growth, population growth, changes in energy intensities, and changes in carbon intensities of energy consumption lead to doubling, tripling, or quadrupling of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in this century.  And using any reasonable climate sensitivity (the expected average temperature change for a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations) yields substantial changes in average temperatures that will cause serious disruptions of human and natural systems.\u201d<br /><br />The reason why we are concerned about the next few decades is that the earth\u2019s climate is sensitive to CUMULATIVE emissions, not just annual emissions, because of the long residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere.  That\u2019s why I and others have long advocated a focus on cumulative carbon budgets as a way to think about this problem (see <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2009/12/06/copenhagen-two-degrees-warming-target/\" target=\"_blank\">http://climateprogress.org...</a> and Meinshausen et al. 2009 for details).  The insights from that approach inform Gore\u2019s and Hansen\u2019s well-placed sense of urgency.  And there\u2019s no real prospect, given that the 2nd law of thermodynamics is what it is, that pulling CO2 from the atmosphere is going to be a solution that can get us out of this mess in time to avoid the risks of our current approach.<br /><br />Third, the one good recent example of the world fixing a global environmental problem (ozone depletion) is not one that came about because of Julian Simon\u2019s postulated wellspring of technological innovation.  Instead, science discovered a problem, and we created political and social institutions to solve the problem.  Technological innovation helped once we started down that path, but it wasn\u2019t an inevitable choice\u2014instead, we as a society made it, informed by reason and evidence.  We decided that we\u2019d rather make changes now to prevent this serious problem than take the risk of it becoming even more serious later.  And that\u2019s exactly what we need to do with climate.<br /><br />REFERENCES<br /><br />Bella, David A. 1979. \"Technological Constraints on Technological Optimism.\"  Technological Forecasting and Social Change.  vol. 14, June. pp. 15-26.<br /><br />Meinshausen, Malte, Nicolai Meinshausen, William Hare, Sarah C.

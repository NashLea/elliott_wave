First, sociologists are not as uniformly liberal as this article makes it sound; political causes alone could have made some explanations unpopular, but they would not have driven them out entirely.  The reason cultural explanations of poverty had disappeared entirely was a general 15- or 20-year absence of culture from sociological theory.  While the Moynihan return certainly contributed to this, the absence had as much to do with the behaviorist logic of describing human action by reference to outside stimuli (the reason such explanations are appealing is that they rest on objectively measurable and easily quantifiable features of the environment, and can thus provide for more convincing explanation).  The second major omission of this article has to do with the reason for its return.  While generational change undoubtedly contributes, it too corresponds with a general shift in how sociologists view action.  Paralleling a shift from behaviorism to cognitivism in psychology, sociologists since the 1980's started developing a cognitive understanding of culture works.  The earliest work in this tradition saw culture as a cognitive product that can be created, transferred and used like a tool in a toolkit (\"like a piece of software\" would be a more familiar contemporary metaphor).  It is the work in this tradition that brought culture of poverty back to the table--and indeed, its insistence that culture is something that \"people use\" instead of \"people are\" can seem like pussyfooting around the topic.  But the more recent incarnations of this theory are far more straightforward: they view cultural learning as something that gradually alters fundamental aspects of social cognition, such as what seems desirable or moral.  Research by scholars like Stephen Vaisey shows, for example, that moral values explain a large portion of adolescent drug use even when all the major economic and social differences are taken into account.  So, this is indeed something of a return to where sociological theory was decades ago, and where lay intuition always remained.  However, this does not mean the discipline went full circle: both structural explanations and \"cultural toolkit\" explanations are still powerful, and will remain on the scene.  But it does mean that quantitative sociologists are having to figure out new ways of measuring beliefs and values-- culture is far harder to deal with objectively than something like socioeconomic standing.", "recommendationCount": 42}, {"assetID": 1968102, "replies": [], "lft": 52, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/us/18poverty.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2697504, "rgt": 53, "userDisplayName": "patygr", "createDate": "1287374319", "userID": 61442589, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1287374611", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1287371011", "commentSequence": 19, "commentBody": "Culture of Poverty is a Lie!

The biggest cost driver is defensive medicine-ask any doctor. This plan does nothing to solve that problem. Our current tort system is a travesty and is unjust. Who would design a system that takes 5 years for a payout, spends 60% of the dollars on lawyers and administration and doesn't reduce malpractice. As a doctor who has been dragged through this process I can tell you it does not deal with all of the facts nor have I been sued for anything other than bad outcome. At the end of the 5 years, when the court has ruled in our favor we win nothing but 5 years of sleepless nights and legal bills paid for by our patients with health care dollars. In addition, the out of court settlements are never counted and last year you paid for a 75,000 dollar bruise from surgery because it was cheaper to settle than defend a case that was not malpractice but rather a known and recognized risk of surgery. There has to be a better, less costly system to protect patients but our legislators are supported by trial lawyers or are trial lawyers and the status quo is maintained. If true tort reform occurred we could better spend our health care dollars and more would have access.

I do not condone what Kouwe did\u2014it was plagiarism and his termination was warranted\u2014but in his sanctimonious analysis of the incident, Mr. Hoyt does much to reveal the anachronistic shackles that the old guard continues to impose on the Times. One paragraph from his piece encapsulates this perfectly:<br /><br />\"Everyone I talked with at The Times agreed that the practices described by Kouwe and Posner were unacceptable. 'If you are writing your own story, you shouldn\u2019t be downloading this stuff,' said Jack Lynch, the news editor of DealBook. 'That\u2019s asking for trouble.' Amen.\"<br /><br />\u201cAmen\u201d?!? Plagiarism is unacceptable. But to condemn the process by which Posner and Kouwe did their background research is to reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how journalism is practiced today as well as a prejudice against online sources as valid texts. There were obviously flaws in the way Kouwe and Posner organized their research, but to say they \u201cshouldn\u2019t be downloading this stuff\u201d is to reveal yourself as a geriatric crank. I suppose in Mr. Lynch's view, the process would have been less reprensible\u2014though the result no less so\u2014had Mr. Kouwe consulted books rather than this nefarious \u201cstuff\u201d they found on the intertubes. Consulting other texts is called research; that the \u201ctext\u201d in question originated online is immaterial.<br /><br />In aligning himself with Lynch and other old-Timesers, Hoyt ignores what should be his priority: initiating a more clear-eyed investigation of the paper\u2019s evolution. Has the combination of staff cutbacks and the faster pace of the web eroded quality? Should there be a qualitative difference between items published in the Times\u2019s blogs and those published in the paper? Is a more rigorous editing process needed for online? Are old standards too expensive or impractical to uphold?<br /><br />But while Hoyt includes vagueries about \u201cconversations worth having\u201d with regard to online and \u201cmore oversight\u201d for Dealbook, what he\u2019s really interested in is a full accounting of Kouwe\u2019s offenses because, as always, his main purpose is to draw attention to the paper\u2019s august reputation and sacrosanct standards, in this case by casting out an unworthy. But such self-congratulation solves nothing; Mr. Kouwe is at fault here, certainly, but magnifying his fault doesn\u2019t exculpate the institution.

I was in a cult that was and is still in place in Dahlonega, GA.  We had a property of 50 acres with a nice lodge on it.  The leaders were very nice and loving and great at telling bible stories distorted to control you.  At first  it seems harmless to move there, they have jobs ready for you.  They sell spa products and naturopathic medicine.  We were doing great, but unbeknownst to us the leaders were making all the businesses their own, transferring  donated money from nonprofit businesses  to profit business( they had both).  It is hard to explain because a few years ago, the leaders pretty much kicked alot of people out and had already moved to other houses in Gainesville, Ga.<br />There is a website  called <a href=\"http://whathappenedtodeerfield.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">whathappenedtodeerfield.wordpress.com...</a>  that gives the stories of many people of this cult, about the leaders that are still operating.  or look up Grant Clarke, or Gregg Hake  or Energetix or Anakiri or Spa on Green Street in Gainesville, GA.   these are a few of their businesses now and two of the leaders.<br />Just remember that people join these cults not knowing it's a cult.  They bring people in and brainwash and make you feel good and it sure is interesting how they did it.  I went in broke so I couldn't donate much but there were people who were in their 50's and donated their 401k  and they let him go(by the way this guy is a brother of one of the leader).   Any ways,  I wouldn't badmouth anyone in a cult until you know how they get people to join and their techniques.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1230815, "replies": [], "lft": 882, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/us/07scientology.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1664176, "rgt": 883, "userDisplayName": "John", "createDate": "1267971025", "userID": 46339558, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268025321", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Houston", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268025321", "commentSequence": 392, "commentBody": "I expected to see references to Catholic priests even though there are over 400,000 priests worldwide and less than 1% have been child molesters.<br />Out of all the known major religions, only the founder of the Christian religion died a horrible death.

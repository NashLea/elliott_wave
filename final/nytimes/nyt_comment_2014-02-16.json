The fact is that it what most wrecked the US auto industry were Big Three corporate management decisions that ignored global competition and continued to build inefficient, gas-guzzling vehicles that fewer consumers wanted over time, something that Patrick mentioned below.<br/><br/>Unions had nothing to do with those decisions.<br/><br/>The bottom line to a solid bottom line is that business must offer products the consumers want and, for years, very poor Big Three management decisions led to very poor products. Interestingly, the successful German model shows that unions are integral to industrial decision making along with corporate management and other community stakeholders.

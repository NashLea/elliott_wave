Has anyone ever attended a book club or other nighttime social event where there weren't desserts and appetizers, even though it's 8pm, and presumably everyone has already had dinner?

If you take energy from the reaction you get entropy, so you would have to keep adding fuel. <br/><br/>The sun is so large that it will remain in its current state for a few more billion years, but how much space would you need for a reactor that would supply a city? The energy released by fusion, is certainly enormous, just a fission bomb only takes about a kilo of material, but a sustained fusion reaction will have to be contained by artificial gravity. In this case it is assumed magnetic fields can do it. It is possible there would be an event horizon as you would be trying to create a miniature black hole.<br/><br/>So again, you confine fusion within a tokamak,how do you use it, without liberating it?", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3436207, "replies": [], "lft": 139, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/upshot/fafsa-follies-to-gain-a-student-eliminate-a-form.html", "parentID": 15871858, "commentID": 15875203, "rgt": 140, "userDisplayName": "Ellen Griffin", "createDate": "1440395054", "userID": 71724087, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1440395349", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Missouri", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1440391749", "commentSequence": 15875203, "commentBody": "You can file an estimate, however, they will not process your paperwork based on that at least at the community college here.

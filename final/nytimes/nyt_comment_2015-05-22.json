It is a political decision to steal less profit from a healthy enterprise than demanded by competing special interests.  <br/><br/>In Alice in Wonderland the Red Queen insisted \"Words mean exactly what I want them to mean when I say them.\" <br/><br/>So it is only in the Red Queen's infinitely flexible lexicon, now adopted by the IMF, that \"failure to tax a commodity vital to modern economic life at rates sufficient to assuage environmentalists' ever-shifting fears of possible climate catastrophe  at some ever-retreating unknown future date\" becomes<br/>a \"subsidy\". <br/><br/>The Red Queen would understand, because to control the definition of the terms to be debated is to seize control of the debate. <br/><br/>I reject this attempt to redefine reduced government theft as \"subsidy\" and I urge you to reject the IMF's bizarre line of twisted logic.

Now that Russia is entered the theater, arming secular moderate groups will not only not succeed, but prolong the war, further destabilize the country and cause more unimaginable suffering to the Syrian people. Syria, because of it's longstanding relationship with Russia, is a natural battleground for two old cold war rivals, and I believe that some of those calling for Assad's removal really just want to stick a thumb in Mr. Putin's eye in the spirit of rivalry. Sure Assad will commit atrocities if we wins back his power, but he may also be coerced into an amnesty deal. Given all the horrible choices, perhaps this is the best we can expect. If we oppose Russia in Syria today, as we did in Afghanistan in the 1990's, will end up with another Afghanistan? Do we detest Russia so much that we would provide arms to anybody willing to take them on? Are we doomed to repeat our mistakes?

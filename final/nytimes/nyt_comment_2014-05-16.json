Even with planning and good intentions, we still end up getting into ruts and making the same recipes over and over again (especially if it's easy and the kids seem to like it).  We try to expose the kids to new foods, but when we deviate too far from stuff they are used it does not go well. One child is particularly picky and often will hardly eat dinner at all. We are determined to keep working on it, especially because we want to expose our kids to lots of different types of food and move them away from having such limited/picky diets.

Two identical seasons, one leads to a SB, the other leads to no playoffs.  What's the one single thing that shows week after week?  The single most unimaginative, most predictive offense in the NFL.

Both SB victories under TC were possible because the D stopped a prolific offense, kept the score close and allowed Eli &amp; Co. to make miraculous plays to pull out the wins.  And why?  Kevin Gilbride, the worst offensive mind in the history of the game.  How bad is this guy?  Two SB rings and never a single sniff at another job, no horrible team looking for a new coach has ever even interviewed this guy.  After SB XLII, the Raiders supposedly asked permission to interview him, but immediately denied they were interested. He's a bum, always been a bum, always will be a bum.  Has any other offensive coordinator ever been punched in the face by his fellow defensive coordinator?  On the sideline, during a game?  See Houston Oilers and Buddy Ryan.  The Giants get at least 2-4 wins a season more without KG.  How does he stay employed?  Get rid of this guy.  The Giants owners owe the fans accountability for the pitiful play of this team.  They say you can't fire all the players, so the bottom line is to give TC an ultimatum, change your assistant coaches or lead them out the door looking for a new job.

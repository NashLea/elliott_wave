However, they also mean fewer babies born dead or with brain injuries.  By the time a stethoscope can pick up fetal distress, most of the time damage has already been done.  Some of the c-sections done for fetal distress are unnecessary, some of those babies would have been born safely.  But wouldn't you happily accept a routine surgical procedure to spare your child the risk of brain damage or death?<br/><br/>Epidurals do not increase c-sections.  The clearest evidence is this:  During the 1990s, many hospitals increased their epidural rates dramatically in a single year as the procedure became more available.  No detectable change in c-section rates.<br/><br/>No, it's not about greed and convenience.  It's about risk aversion.  Decades ago, babies were born dead or birth-injured significantly more often.

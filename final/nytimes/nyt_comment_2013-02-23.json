As I see it, though, the issue here is not what happened at Shane Keller's apartment. It is whether this image is what a reasonable viewer would take it to be. In the context of the portfolio it had to be seen as a document of a high crime inner city neighborhood in Rochester. The World Press Photo submission which includes it is titled \u201cThe Crescent\u201d and the text describes that area of Rochester and its problems. Indeed, Mr. Pellegrin\u2019s text claims that the images were made there, which in the case of Mr. Keller\u2019s image was not the case. Shane lived in a suburban town about 20 minutes away from the Crescent. He was not associated in any way with that area or its problems. <br/><br/>If Pellegrin was trying to make a point about the connection between gun culture and inner city violence this is not evident from the edit, captions, or supporting text. The image looks like the same kind of documented moment captured in the other eleven images in this story. It is not that, and Pellegrin's response never claims that it was.<br/><br/>No later explanation can eliminate this gap between what the image was claimed to be and what it objectively shows. I regret that we did not contact the photographer, because of the distress it may have caused and because the debate over this issue distracts from the real question.

How difficult is that?  I know that everyone knows this, but somehow, politicians are praised for doing something that they are not.  When they actually produce income, instead of just taking and spending tax money that they collect, is when they should be applauded. When they work for  minimum wage, instead of being in the 1% and working half of the year, is when they deserve kudos.  They are mostly lip service, telling us what they believe will garner our vote.  If the current bashing, finger-pointing, demonization, name calling, and all out hatred of the opposite party continues, this country will forever be divided.

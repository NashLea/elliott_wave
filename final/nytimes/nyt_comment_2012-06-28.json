Limits set for GHGs to protect the health of US citizens and the natural environment from the effects of climate change is really no different than setting MCLs (maximum contaminant levels) for such constituents as benzene and arsenic for the NPDES (national pollutant discharge elimination systems) for surface water.<br/><br/>Essentially MCLs are based on empirical and analytic observation and mathematical models, respectively. The science to calculate MCLs is pretty much accepted, but with our evolving understanding of biochemistry and genetics, MCLs may come up for argument. We saw this with arsenic MCL  in the 2000s.<br/><br/>Now GHG limits will be established scientifically in the same light as MCLs for water. Acceptable levels will be argued back and forth between the government scientist and its consultants and industry and its consultants. And eventually levels will be set. <br/><br/>On a legal level the EPA as an entity would have to be unconstitutional - not its practice of setting discharge levels - since it has been doing that for over 40 years without constitutional challenges.

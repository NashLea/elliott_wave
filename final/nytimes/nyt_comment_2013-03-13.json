My father was an advisor at the local university and 25 years ago, he would advise students away from degrees that would put them in the pickle so many California students are in, desperately waiting for course availability. He also pushed for credit for life learning, knowing that a college degree was a ticket to success for people from a variety of backgrounds, including older and foreign students.<br/>With community colleges overcrowded, online colleges charging exorbitant rates despite being unaccredited, and our local U's quality of ed having taken a nosedive because they're desperate to take any student who qualifies for loans, I'm more than ready for a revolution.<br/>My son, who has a learning disability, thrives on online learning and is highly disciplined and motivated. His school resists having him do even one course online, which would allow him a Khan-style flipped approach that he finds enormously superior to the \"listen to lecture, instantly regurgitate material on worksheet\" approach they use for everything, including science (no money for labs) and math (no option for nonconstructivist curricula).

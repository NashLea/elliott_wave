At the present, 73 years later, the investment in the fixed capital is much higher than in the variable capital hence the productive forces are hugely larger than in 1938 and, as a result, the labor productivity much larger as well.\r<br/><br/>High labor productivity means high profits but low growth. In 1938, the labor productivity was not as high as it is now so that profits were lower and growth rate higher than now. Due to higher growth rate, the 1938 recovery was solid and the recession within a Great Depression ended earlier than expected. The war in the earlier 1940s also boosted the employment.\r<br/><br/>The masters of the universe together with the masters of Washington, D.C. have overly relied on tweaking of the fiscal and monetary policies as the only tools for securing a recovery and therefore failed miserably because they do not understand the fundamentals of the political economics of capitalism of lateness.\r<br/><br/>The policy changes might have worked in 1938 but are no longer working now. The only working remedies at least on a temporary basis these days are, heavy debt incurred upon the households to boost artificial demand, outsourcing investments and jobs overseas to help alleviate and compensate anemic domestic growth, and large-scale, heavy war expenditures to dissipate unused or surplus capital and labor power. \r<br/><br/>Each of these remedies has enormous drawbacks, as extremely negative by-products, which are inimical to a decent recovery. \r<br/><br/>The only correct approach is the transformative approach \u2013 to transform private into public profits in the economy by levying heavy (from 61% to 75%) taxes on the wealthy 2% and corporations.

It turned out that I used somewhat less because I had access to the WI-FI. When I returned, AT&amp;T reduced my cost somewhat for the unused data portion.  They had said they would do that before I left, but I had been skeptical that it would really happen.<br/><br/>I also took travel expert Rick Steve's advice on an earlier trip and purchased an unlocked cellphone and local SIM card. My husband felt we wouldn't need it - who did we know to call? - but humored me. When our rental car broke down 2 days later, we were able to call for a replacement with that phone.  For this trip I purchased a SIM card from a company which caters to students abroad and offered English-language customer service.  It turned out that we couldn't get the phone number for the SIM card until we got to France. (We flew in and out of<br/>\nSpain.) When my husband and I got to France and got the phone number I tried to confirm some reservations in Spain. The calls would not go through. I called the company, which confirmed the numbers were blocked \"because of potential fraud.\" After 3 days of this, with all my calls blocked, I persuaded the company to make an exception to their policy and refund my money in return for a promise not to identify them.

I've been thinking this one through.<br/><br/>No, hear me out. When they assign homework during the school year, there are typically two assignments a day - an English assignment and a math assignment. And then there's a weekly Spanish or science handout.<br/><br/>It's not exactly the most inspiring work ever, but it's clear and predictable. Every day we sit down and each kid picks two worksheets of her choice from the homework packet and if nobody whines or dawdles it's all done in half an hour.<br/><br/>And then for summer they make a slightly-longer packet. <br/><br/>If they gave as  much homework for summer as they did for eight weeks of school, it'd be easy to get done. I'd just say  \"Every day, right after swimming we do our homework.\" It'd take half an hour out of our day, and none of us would really like it, but we'd have a routine and we'd do it.<br/><br/>But instead there's no way to dole it out evenly, because it's about a week's worth of work (or a day's if you do more than one page at a time), and you feel silly having them do half a page every Monday or whatever. So instead you do it all the last day of school and then lose it under the couch, or intend to do it all the last day of vacation but instead lose it under the couch. (Or somewhere. It's not actually under the couch, which is a problem, but we've been doing our own work during the summer anyway.)<br/><br/>If they're going to assign dreary worksheets over the summer (something which they can grade, unlike anything useful and interesting), they might as well go whole hog and give us enough to do it right.

My general impression of the comments is that they are made by people who probably never heard about Libya until the recent uprise. For those who haven't yet figured who the 'rebels' are, these are ordinary citizens facing extinction by Gaddafi war machine if they don't fight. They are sunni muslims. there is no Alqaeda, since Gaddafi has destroyed it in Libya long ago (the only good deed in his entire life). There is no tribal war, fighters from all tribes are in the same battle fighting together. We are fed up trying to explain to the world the tribalism in libya is a social curtain not political in any way!<br/>\nFor those thinking that going to Libya resulted in escalation of killing, I am again sorry to say this is wrong. I would suggest looking on you tube for the convoys of heavy weapons and artillary that Gaddafi sent to Benghazi. this convoy was more than 20 miles in length and with the orders to WIPE OUT Benghazi city (1 million population). these are not my words but the confessions of Gaddafi's soldiers and battle leaders about there orders. Don't you think this has saved many lives?<br/>\nDue to the geographic area of libya, most of Gaddafi's forces are concentrated in the west and hence resistance is suffering a bigger hit there.<br/>\nFor those asking for withdrawal at this stage, what do you think will happen then. I guarantee that more than half of the libyan population will be extinct in few weeks by Gaddafi, especially with the help of those rogue regimes that still support him like Syria, Iran &amp; Algeria.<br/>\nFinally, they are not rebels.

For the long term investor, a stock should be valued at what it can bring in during the next 10 years, not the previous 10 years.  During periods of economic downturns, future profits are expected to be higher than an average growth figure of the ten years.  Lok what happened after the great depression, or even the last large recession of the early 80's.  Both these periods were charcterized by positive slopes in the S&amp;P valuation trend.  Some of the long term anomalies that you see are strongly effected by this.<br/><br/>The second effect that is not accounted for is the advent of 401Ks.  With 401Ks, more money went into the stock market, so a higher P/E ratio should be expected.  While the next 20 will see money removed from the stock market as baby boomers retire, there will still be more money entering the stock market from 401Ks than there was before 401Ks started.  So a different slope should be used after the advent of 401Ks.  While the bubbles that we've experienced for the last 15 years tend to hide this, even discounting the bubbles shows an overall trend of higher P/E ratios that pre-401K years.<br/><br/>IF you are a short term investor, I wouldn't begin to tell you where the market is going to be in 1 day, 1week, 1 month, or even 1 year from now.

Anything corporations earn ultimately goes to people.\" Millard Foolmore Romney<br/><br/>Millard there is trying to pretend that the \"people\" corporate earnings go to are workers like you and me and that Iowa heckler. No, they're not. As Paul Krugman pointed out in a blogpost last week, \"... the corporate profits tax isn't a tax on these organizations. It's a tax on these organizations' profits -- the share of their income that does NOT go to workers and suppliers.\" <br/><br/>As any number of pundits, not to mention your own common sense, will tell you -- the \"people\" corporate earnings go to are executives and shareholders. These people are disproportionally rich. While the taxes corporations pay vary widely, corporations pretty much all pay at a lower rate than a middle-class taxpayer does, and some corporations pay no tax at all: GE, for instance, paid a negative tax for 2010 -- they GOT $1.1 billion from the taxpayers. Overall, corporate earnings taxes are at a near-historic low. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the effective corporate-level tax rate ranges from \"29 percent on computer equipment to a negative 2.2 percent on petroleum and natural-gas structures.\" <br/><br/>No wonder Millard stands up for corporate \"people.\" He is one of them. He loves that corporate welfare. If Millard were to become president, he would benefit financially from his own policies. That's one clear difference between Millard &amp; Barack.

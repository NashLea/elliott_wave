The compass needle pops again in an accidental observation that electrical currents alter magnetic fields. Maxwell provided the mathematics for the relationship between the two and realized that light was an electromagnetic wave. Einstein published his special theory of relativity in a paper on The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies to solve a problem in Maxwell's equations for moving observers. When he generalized it to include bodies accelerating under gravity he developed the General Theory of Relativity.

Shortages arise from the preference of physicians to practice in more densely-populated areas and to eschew primary care in favor of more lucrative specialties.   To the poor and uninsured, it hardly has mattered whether good regular medical care was unavailable because there were no appropriate doctors available or because their services were unaffordable.   The ACA now makes medical care affordable, and had Republicans not stood in the way, a single-payer system would have done it more efficiently.  <br/><br/>And, by the way, Malthus was proven to be dead wrong long ago.  Economic resources, certainly in America, are not so limited that it can't support more people.  People and technology create resources and wealth from economic activity, when well-governed, as proven by the enormous growth in the U.S. population at the same time as GDP per-capita has increased. <br/><br/>A local college likely offers an introductory macroeconomics course, and you might enjoy learning the basic principles, as well as the means of acquiring reliable data.

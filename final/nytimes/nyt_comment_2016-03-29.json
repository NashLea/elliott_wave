Factoring in other commitments, such as time spent preparing for standardized tests, or writing applications for summer programs and college, it becomes clear that students have no choice but to stay up late. Reporting for school the next day at 7 or 8 am becomes difficult, and even for students who never appear tardy at school, the previous night's hard work and fatigue often catch up to them and lead to decreased attention in class, thus forcing students to stay up even later in order to self-learn the information.

Science is a system of thought based on observable evidence in conjunction with other systematic forms of thinking, like logic and mathematics.

No religion allows itself to be revised that way because God doesn't volunteer for experiments. <br/><br/>Judaism has a tradition of rigorous study of religious texts (for men, anyway), with the goal of testing faith by asking difficult and mostly unanswerable questions. Doubt is what creates true faith; without it, \"faith\" is just blind acceptance of somebody else's professed authority.

A \"non-believer\" doesn't have to be against religion, but may believe that questions about God are irrelevant to  morality or philosophy (since they get muddied up with religious politics and traditions), or that because they are unknowable to humans, they must always be questions rather than answers.

Once the phone is unlocked, it is straightforward to see what is there.<br/><br/>What is so tough about figuring that out?

As a composer and performer with a particular interest in improvisation, I am always aware of the huge difference between expressing something in the moment vs. careful practicing and memorization of pre-existing material. I prefer to accompany silent films by improvising and just experiencing that moment in time, even with films I know very well, because I am not the same person that I was the last time I played for the film. On the other hand, I have also spent long hours meticulously scoring films so that the score matches the action and emotional flow of the film to as precise a degree as I can envision. Somewhere in between is probably a happy medium. When performing my own notated music, I invariably make changes each time, too, and I suspect that other composers like Chopin, Beethoven and Mozart and Bach would have found the idea of mechanical reproductions of their music, always the same, never varied in tempo or nuance from one listening to another, silly.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2682980, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/dont-stop-believing/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3757534, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Marie Burns", "createDate": "1304123366", "userID": 4461145, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304136922", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304133322", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Tomasky &amp; Remnick are right, but I think the motive is even more sinister than they suggest. The purpose of the birther -- and now the where's-the-transcript? movements aren't just to appeal white people who may be easily moved by conspiracy theories, race-baiting &amp; fear-mongering. The appeal is to ALL white people.<br/><br/>When Barack Obama was running for president, I told some white Democrats who, to put it nicely, weren't too keen on having a black president not to worry about it: \"After a short while, you won't think of him as the black president,\" I said, \"but as the president.\"<br/><br/>The racist implications of the birther movement -- and now of the college records challenge -- are clear, and a lot of writers have commented on how these movements are attempts to delegitimize President Obama by \"proving\" that he isn't qualified to be president. But I think there's another goal. After all, good college grades are not a Constitutional requirement for the presidency. And how you got into college doesn't matter either: a number of presidents (e.g., Dubya) likely got into college because they were legacies -- their fathers attended the schools before them. <br/><br/>The real idea behind these movements is to continually remind white people that President Obama is black. The perpetrators want white people to think of Obama as \"the black president\" and not as \"the president.\" I know these efforts work on me. I never think of Obama's race when the birther nonsense isn't in the news. But I am reminded of his race when racist remarks or efforts are in the headlines. It's impossible not to realize the president is black when somebody is pointing it out. So the effect of these racist campaigns is twofold: it \"justifies\" the loons' belief that President Obama is somehow not qualified or not worthy to be president, at the same time it highlights his race to people who find the racist remarks disgusting. <br/><br/>Donald Trump is really hoping that deep-down, I'm a racist, too, and that if he keeps pointing out that Obama is black, I'll eventually realize that Obama really is \"different\" from me. The ploy won't work on me because -- like Stephen Colbert -- I don't see race. But it may well work on some white voters, voters who otherwise would have got over any misgivings they had about voting for a president of another race.<br/><br/>Donald Trump is determined not to let you forget that President Obama is black.<br/><br/>The Constant Weader at <a href=\"http://www.RealityChex.com\" title=\"www.RealityChex.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RealityChex.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 255}, {"assetID": 2682980, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/dont-stop-believing/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3757557, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "mickeyrad", "createDate": "1304124517", "userID": 42837060, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304136934", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Centerville Iowa", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304133334", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "What do you think FDR would have done if people had questioned his citizenship?

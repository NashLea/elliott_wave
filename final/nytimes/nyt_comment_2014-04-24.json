Many Moldovans speak Russian as a second language and take advantage of their fluency by going to work in Russia and then send much needed money back home. <br/><br/>Some of the older generation have fond memories of the Soviet Union. They will argue that life was not perfect then, but in some ways it was better than now.  Some of these same people will also call Putin a bully.

It is not hard to see the Moldovans' point-of-view.  Our Peace Corps medical doctor advised us not to eat fish caught in any body of water in Moldova because they were all polluted.  Infrastructure was in desperate need of repair.

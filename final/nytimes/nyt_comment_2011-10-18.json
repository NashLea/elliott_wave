It's time to put the brakes on the Javerts of education.  Sure you have the flagrant offenders, those who supply the answers or those who tamper with answer sheets post-test, but seriously, does warning about a question warrant such a draconian punishment? The fate of Ms. Kim is a clear example of a politically motivated stunt to deflect any whispers of tolerated cheating.  Cheating at a charter school?  No, that only happens at public schools. We'll just let one go to show how serious we are.<br/><br/>Sure, fire the flagrant offenders, and punish the other transgressors. But the punishment must be proportionate to the offense, otherwise, what are we teaching the students?  We don't live in a black and white world, and our education system should reflect that.  Even the multiple choice exams reflect that:  \"choose the BEST answer\".  The \"best answer\" is never going to be a statement along the extremes.  The \"best answer\" usually does not feature strongly polarizing words such as \"always\" or \"never\" or be as black-and-white. But the education system has made such a choice and a bad one at that. <br/><br/>\u201cAlthough we had no hard evidence, the soft evidence led us to make a decision to let her go\"<br/><br/>Wow. Such boneheadedness is why I rarely respected school administrators.  Firing Ms. Kim was clearly not the best answer here.  At least she had the courage to take the risk to warn the students because she gave a damn about their future. The administrators cowered behind their zero tolerance rule.  The Times should go back to Promise Academy and ask her former students the following question:<br/><br/>Under what circumstances will you warn students about a tricky question on a test?<br/><br/>A) Never.  Giving warnings or hints on a test is cheating.<br/>\nB) It is OK to do it out of care because the students need the help.<br/>\nC) It is OK to do it out of care, but just don't get caught.<br/><br/>What do you think they will really answer when it doesn't count for a grade?", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3286256, "replies": [], "lft": 176, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/nyregion/how-cheating-cases-at-new-york-schools-played-out.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4715517, "rgt": 177, "userDisplayName": "Dilys", "createDate": "1318911657", "userID": 55970454, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1318912665", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1318909065", "commentSequence": 75, "commentBody": "I can't decide if Thomas' subject and predicate (in his first sentence) are in agreement.

While participants are not monitored throughout their lives by the court, these courts get people into treatment and incentivize them to stay in treatment instead of going to jail.

Plenty could be said about flaws in Hillary's career ... but I have observed enough iceberg-deep, even unconscious prejudice from men towards talented women that I've been forced to conclude that women -- over half the human race -- are the most systematically discriminated-against group in the world.

In many respects the world is in a backlash as far as women's rights go, not a progressive phase. To elect our first female president in this climate would speak volumes. That said, I certainly agree with Frank that gender, race, sexuality, etc cannot be the only criteria. Competence -- ideally excellence -- trumps all.

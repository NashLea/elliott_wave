Anyone who wants to give Carter any credit, give him credit for making our situation worse. He created the Department of Energy during his administration, and our dependence on foreign oil has been increasing ever since. Poster 47 is absolutely correct, it will be decades before alternative energy will be truly viable on a large scale. We need to use the resources we have available now. To those like Bolger who claim the new oil reserves won't be productive, they really need to get out of their little world. Perhaps a trip out to the oil fields in ND, where oil production is booming in the Bakken Formation would change his mind. Not likely, because facts are inconvenient truths. Then there are those like \"plus6sigma\", who want to nationalize our energy industry. At what point do you just admit you want socialism so those who want to do nothing have the same amount as those who have worked hard their whole life?<br />For those who claim rising energy costs won't hurt the economy, take off the rose colored glasses. $4.00 gas did a large part to destroy the economy the last time, and it will take a huge toll this time also. Eugene Gorrin's points were just the tip of the iceberg. Everything that is produced and processed uses energy in the process. Everything will cost more, taking dollars out of the pockets of consumers. To the posters who keep talking about raising gas prices even more and forcing many to use public transportation, that is not feasible either in the majority of the country. The US is a vast country, unlike Europe, which has a much denser population covering a much smaller land mass. Instead lets build more nuclear plants and use the reserves we have in this country that are not tapped while we give out incentives to create truly feasible alternative energy sources for our future needs.<br />By the way, poster 1, Adam, was right. When gas prices rose last time, there was a huge cry blaming Bush for allowing the prices to rise so high and the oil companies making profits. Where is the outrage now? Bush is no longer in office. It is Obama's issue, and he is doing nothing to change it. I just want to see some of the same ones who blamed Bush call out Obama on this.

If these judges faced Congressional re-confirmation every 6 years or so, then they could be held responsible for poor decisions such as in Snyder-v-Phelps.<br /><br />In addition, I don't understand why Americans think that the evil 1st Amendment is something beneficial. For instance, Canada and Australia have no similar law, and yet both nations are better societies with a higher quality of life than the United States. America could use another Constitutional Convention so it can terminate the hideous 1st Amendment, as well as the many other poor laws and undemocratic institutions in the Federal Government. The Federal Government needs a sunset law, so that laws (and existing Constitutional amendments) have to be re-confirmed every 25 years or so by Congress or expire. The Supreme Court would be a good choice for an earliest possible expiration date.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2469393, "replies": [], "lft": 506, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/magazine/06berenson-t.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3468266, "rgt": 507, "userDisplayName": "Natalie", "createDate": "1299130802", "userID": 63090636, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299131744", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299131744", "commentSequence": 188, "commentBody": "I am a Colombian citizen and I understand the plight of the Peruvian people.  It's heart breaking when people, who really don't understand the complexities of our countries, say they \"understand the freedom movement\".

From their comfortable apartments in the United States and Europe, in an arrogant manner, they tell us that we don't have \"democratically elected governments\" and that's why they've \"chosen\" to come free our people.  Free us from what?  No one has the right to take up arms to kill, extort, kidnap innocent civilians.

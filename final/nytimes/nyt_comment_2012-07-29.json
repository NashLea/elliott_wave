There was no parallel sudden increase of carbon dioxide and this rules out the greenhouse effect by laws of radiation physics. Its most likely cause is solar effects, a continuation of coming out of the Little Ice Age.\"<br/>\nGreenhouse gases are not the only forcing at work on climate.  If you look at the amount of energy added to the climate by greenhouse gases (1500x10^21 joules since 1960 - if memory serves), it is far in excess of what is needed to account for the observed warming.  This means that other forcings or feedbacks are in play and have reduced the net amount of energy absorbed by the surface/atmosphere.  Changes in clouds, changes in amount of energy going to the oceans, changes in aerosol are all candidates.  Around 1940, great increases in industrialization probably resulted in lots of airborne particulate matter that may have changed albedo enough to account for the changes - improvements in air quality later in the century may have allowed warming to resume.  I do not think that the data on global air quality are good enough to prove that.<br/>\nYour insistence that warming track CO2 concentration exactly is simply not realistic and is wrong.  These other factors will impact the timing and intensity of the resulting warming (climate sensitivity).

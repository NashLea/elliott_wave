The controversies will not go away. Atleast Obama was less prone to blunders as Clinton is and if she wins, they will not let her rule. So folks, 4 more years of fighting in the senate. If Trump wins, I cannot say because I do not know what he plans to do.

In this case, there is nothing to replace it with except Trump and Putin, not USA and Russia leading to a new social contract, but Trump and Putin.  Perhaps Mr. Trump fantasizes himself and Pres. Putin as something out of the old WCW/WWE story line.  If that's the case, then this is further evidence that he and his core supporters can't see the difference between fiction and reality.  This is the real world you are staging your melodrama in, Mr. Trump. The set is earth and the actors whose fate you alone want to decide, everyone on it.  To view the presidency as a position of such power is not consistent with our long-held ideals.  To take such a responsibility frivolously and selfishly, as you do, is an act of infamy, even if you lose and never see the inside of the White House again."}]}, "lft": 294, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/upshot/clinton-has-solid-lead-in-electoral-college-trumps-winning-map-is-unclear.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 20369812, "rgt": 297, "userDisplayName": "jwp-nyc", "createDate": "1478394702", "userID": 50396067, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1478406310", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "new york", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1478402710", "commentSequence": 20369812, "commentBody": "Trump is just trolling for his Nazi magic and depending on henchmen Lewandowski and Giuliani.

The CO2 emitted by plant life annually does totally dwarf the emissions from burning fossil fuels. But plants are taking up a larger amount than is emitted.\"<br /><br />This is not entirely correct. Important for the uptake of CO_2 by vegetation are two processes: The tranfer of CO_2 through the stomatas and the CO_2 uptake inside the stomatal cavities. It is rather difficult to quantify these processes.<br /><br />The stomatal resistance of the foliage, for instance, is a function of the photosynthetically active radiation, the distribution of the leaf area density, the water vapor deficit, the leaf temperature, the soil moisture content, and the ambient CO_2 concentration. The quantification of this stomatal resistance is based on a crude parameterization scheme. It becomes more crude if in a numerical model of the atmosphere like the atmospheric module of a GCM the stomatal resistance for a patchy landscape has to be quantified.<br /><br />What is the stomatal resistance, for instance, in the case of a GCM grid element of about 60 000 km^2? How can the uptake of CO_2 inside the cavities be quantified in such a case? These questions cannot be answered in a reasonable manner. Any attempt to quantify the uptake of CO_2 by vegetation is mainly guessing using crude parameterization schemes.<br /><br />Even if someone has 100 bottles of wine in his cellar it does not mean that his consumption of wine does increase.<br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />Gerhard ", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 1983632, "replies": [], "lft": 26, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/winter-extremes-seen-for-northwest-southwest/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3145588, "rgt": 27, "userDisplayName": "Ben McCall", "createDate": "1293656840", "userID": 46746186, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293686558", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Palm Desert", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293686558", "commentSequence": 12, "commentBody": "Andrew Revkin needs to start a new career.

Carbon contamination of the atmosphere, as RayP points out is characterized by enduring and increasing damage to the Earth, and those who inhabit it.

To be consistent you have to use a negative discount rate for that.   The result certainly balances out way lower than +3%, and most likely is negative.<br /><br />The general rubric for dealing with this goes under the name of the social discount rate, and is not a cost of funds, but an attempt to calculate harms and benefits to future generations to balance against those in this generation.<br /><br />Using a simplistic financial discount rate  as Lomborg does, is as Steve Bloom pointed out on a different question, characteristic of the freakonomics school of argument, where each chapter contains a fundamental sleight-of-hand that requires a degree of expertise to spot.

The unfortunate term \"global warming\" is about air pollution, energy policy, and land use. For those who believe that air pollution is good (and that our limited atmosphere can absorb unlimited amounts of carbon dioxide), please feel free to conduct your own scientific experiment. Put your car in the garage, close all the doors, and turn the engine on. Of course, we all know that such an act is suicide. Pumping infinite amounts of toxins into the confines of our atmosphere also is suicide because the atmosphere is like a big balloon that traps everything inside. Contrary to some popular thinking, air pollution doesn't escape into space. In fact, significant amounts of toxins precipitate back into our water supplies on the earth's surface (such as mercury).<br /><br />Secondly, global warming (climate change) is about our energy policy. Since when is wasting energy and propping up the profits of oil companies and utilities good for everyone?  Since when does that make most businesses more profitable? Is propping up the profits of hostile regimes really the patriotic energy policy? Ask our 9/11 first responders what they think about the issue.<br /><br />Finally, is deforesting the world and reducing the planet's ability to absorb carbon dioxide really a good idea? Are we afraid that those trees provide hiding places for terrorists and wild animals who want to attack us? Are we to believe that cow pastures, parking lots, coal mines, and oil fields are what god meant to do with this planet? And how about all of those other pesky creatures like polar bears, dolphins, whales, wolves, tigers, and eagles. Why did god put them in the way of human progress?<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2213411, "replies": [], "lft": 174, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/lomborg-replies-to-dot-earth-readers/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3146266, "rgt": 175, "userDisplayName": "Sere", "createDate": "1293676254", "userID": 8066901, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293686652", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293686652", "commentSequence": 81, "commentBody": "Louis,<br /><br />Let\u2019s not be so wordily disingenuous.

An article that appears to support Global Warming while stating that the climate is getting colder is exactly what sells newspapers (or attracts web traffic.) But the article uses our own inexact, non-scientific sense of \"colder\" or \"warmer\" weather to imply something that the facts don't support. It especially exploits the fact that most people who are not scientists assume heavier snowfalls MUST occur along with colder weather.<br />  I would like to reiterate the point. Winters in the northern U.S., northern Europe and east Asia have shown an INCREASE in high snowfall events over the last few decades, and this makes sense under the theories about Global Warming. But they are NOT getting colder, and this is supported by factual evidence. By conflating the two, Mr. Cohen gets the attention and satisfaction of people who (against the great majority of climatologists) believe there is no Global Warming. Just as importantly, he talks about the planet clearly getting warmer so that the people who believe in Global Warming look at it as supportive of their views. But the article contains a subtle insistance that winters in the most heavily populated corridors of the U.S., Europe and Asia are getting colder due to Global Warming. As another reader commented here, if that's true than we don't need to care. But that is NOT true, and we do need to care.<br />  The saddest part of this is that the NY Times, the \"paper of record\", which I have read and admired for over 40 years, is publishing an article that makes incorrect statements stated as fact on an extremely important issue.

Some fairly high-powered scientists think it will persist into 2030-2040(Easterbrook, Tsonis, the Russian academicians) but there is no guarantee of any such thing.<br /><br />If and when global warming resumes, as measured by a clear rise in OHC, then it would be appropriate to work the puzzle on why cold winters would appear in a warming world.<br /><br />Until then, there is no need to tax the brain to resolve such a contradiction, because the underlying premise of the conundrum-that the world is warming- does not, at present, appear to be operating.", "recommendationCount": 21}, {"assetID": 2208658, "replies": [], "lft": 58, "assetURL": "http://projects.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/12/19/why-remarry/think-of-the-children", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3146221, "rgt": 59, "userDisplayName": "Lucy", "createDate": "1293674591", "userID": 60680831, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293686723", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293686723", "commentSequence": 28, "commentBody": "\"Surveys show that Americans tend to form new partnerships after a divorce faster than people in most other wealthy nations.\"<br /><br />Probably because it's practically impossible to live in this country without two incomes.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

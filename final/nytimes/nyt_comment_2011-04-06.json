The downside to all of this (besides me giving up a 9.15 pack a day habit, only joking) is the jailing of these entrepreneurs. Yes, I rather have someone like Lonnie dealing this vice than going back to robbing. The city and state governments have got to find a way to work with such individuals. Evidently he is reformed but can't find work. So he makes it and what does the government do? Arrest him again and again. So there's the lost taxes (me paying for his arrests, too)  that could be made by having Lonnie &amp; Co. pay for a sellers license or whatever pertaining to cigarettes.

Please accept my apologies in advance: I'm a law student.<br/><br/>If you think some affable guy should be able to sell loose cigarettes in blatant disregard of the law, you are saying that some especially attractive girl should be able to sell her body, some rakish strip miner should be able to rape the earth and affect his neighbors' health, that some organic poppy farmer should be able to produce boutique heroin for tasteful aesthetes, or that some otherwise-upstanding truckdriver should be allowed to usher illegal immigrants into our country. I'm all for stripping unnecessary oversight, but this not an example of that...there are good reasons for not having anyone who has access to cigarettes being allowed to sell them as they can.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the tax on cigarettes subsidizes the services that NYers enjoy, and NY's legislature is unwilling to tax more sensical things like corporate earnings or the profits hedge fund managers make. In this tricky political climate where things HAVE to get paid for and no one is willing to make the people who have money step up, the poor cigarette smokers are getting milked...but it wouldn't work if they didn't smoke, and the fact that they choose to smoke impacts the NYC public health system.<br/><br/>You might think that $12.50 is ridiculous, and I agree...but only because my first pack of cigarettes was $2.00, and I bought it when I was 16. I quit after my first pack.  However, I look forward to the day when cigarettes are a curious relic, like bloodletting. It's a stupid, horrible, addictive habit, and I was horrified that Obama got the FDA into the business of policing their standards as they have no positive attributes to justify their place in our society. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Lonnie is selling something without oversight...we can assume he is not selling cigarettes to minors because he seems so charming, but who really knows? He flirts with women, saying they shouldn't smoke..and then sells them Newports, with their fiberglass additives. Does he do the same with teenage basketball players who want a butt after practice? Along these lines, can we assume that he reports and is being taxed on his black market income? <br/><br/>I think Lonnie is an engaging person, but there is no reason to wish that such people are allowed to skirt employment and engagement with society that falls within its prescribed norms.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2597662, "replies": [], "lft": 320, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/nyregion/05loosie.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3646844, "rgt": 321, "userDisplayName": "Todd", "createDate": "1302050960", "userID": 61709219, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302062456", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Diego", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302058856", "commentSequence": 142, "commentBody": "Legislating morality inevitably leads to so-called criminal activity such as this.

I can personally attest to the failure of this online learning mode for remedial students in a skill-based course such as writing. From 30 original students, only 9 have actively survived to this week. The rest have disappeared for various reasons, including illness, accident, learning disabilities, laziness, inability to function online, and disinterest in our work. These 9 students may or may not pass; none passed the in-class mid-term this week. I see them only 2 hours/week in this \"hybrid\" course, and it simply isn't enough to help students who struggle in the mostly under-class (first in their family in college, born of immigrants, over 30 years old, etc.). They need my personal help and aren't getting it. Even though I am on-line 7 days/week via email to answer questions, and they have a decent textbook, it isn't enough. They need personal attention, hand-holding, guidance and yes, teaching, and it isn't happening. Every teacher at my school whom I ask says they would never teach such a class if they could help it. The dean, an old friend, tells me confidentially she knows this doesn't work, but the administration insists this is the \"wave of the future\". Good luck to all of you teachers in this mode, and all of your students, who if they are anything like mine, are struggling. For those who want to make policy and financial decisions about the value of this education, I invite you to my class to see the results: there aren't any. I suppose 3 or 4 of my students may pass this semester, a high investment of my salary for very few successes. I'll never teach this kind of class again, and I am ashamed I can't help my students more.", "recommendationCount": 358}, {"assetID": 2602262, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/opinion/06Weldon.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3647448, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Patrice Ayme", "createDate": "1302061042", "userID": 35921939, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302062996", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "High Mountains Somewhere", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302059396", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I have written extremely condemning comments about Saif Al Islam Qaddafi.

That to avoid the sort of situation as in Ivory Coast, where an unelected president still refuses to leave, 10 years later. And the possibility to use force to remedy such an evolution, should it occur, as is finally presently done in Ivory Coast.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://patriceayme.wordpress.com/\" title=\"http://patriceayme.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://patriceayme.wordpress.com/</a> \r", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 2602262, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/opinion/06Weldon.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3647458, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "DGH", "createDate": "1302061242", "userID": 30711961, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302062996", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seattle", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302059396", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "If those Libyans had an ounce of sense they would let US take care of the whole shebang!", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 2602086, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/estimating-medicare-taxes-versus-benefits/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3647573, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "LV", "createDate": "1302063010", "userID": 9136410, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302063306", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302059706", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Great find.<br/><br/>It seems to me that, on an actuarial basis, Medicare should be required to balance its budget. Wouldn't such a requirement be a great negotiating position for Medicare to bargain with providers so that only proven, effective treatments are covered?

Over time, such care transitions from a novelty to a necessity.

Places inevitably change, I know.

I'd say, though, that most of the people who go there, including the many gay people who make it a summer residence and have given it a third identity, are there with an attitude that appreciates and respects the history and character of the place.  I question whether an influx of cruise ships may bring huge numbers of people who, even if they wish no harm, will be stopping for a day, at one stop of several on a cruise, and will be insensitive to the different places they visit for a moment -- how can they be?

Our Constitution enshrines the principle of balance among our three branches of government. And when it comes to our personal finances, we know that the family checkbook must balance.<br/><br/>So when we hear that the federal government hasn't balanced its books in more than a decade, it seems sensible to demand a return to that kind of balance in Washington as well. But that would actually be a huge mistake.<br/><br/>History tells the tale. The federal government has achieved fiscal balance (even surpluses) in just seven periods since 1776, bringing in enough revenue to cover all of its spending during 1817-21, 1823-36, 1852-57, 1867-73, 1880-93, 1920-30 and 1998-2001. We have also experienced six depressions. They began in 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893 and 1929.<br/><br/>Do you see the correlation? The one exception to this pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the dot-com and housing bubbles fueled a consumption binge that delayed the harmful effects of the Clinton surpluses until the Great Recession of 2007-09.<br/><br/>Why does something that sounds like good economics \u2014 balancing the budget and paying down debt \u2014 end up harming the economy?

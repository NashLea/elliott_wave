That is the date that Nouri Al-Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq made his first official visit to Tehran. During a meeting with Ahmadinejad who is the enemy of our country it was decided that they would resolve their differences and the two countries would form a partnership that would share the development of the riches oil fields in the world which lay on the border between the two countries. The question was raised about United States occupation of Iraq. Both parties agreed that they did not need to anything but simply let the United States stay in Iraq until December 31, 2011 when the occupation of Iraq was set to expire according to the contract made by George W. Bush. The renewal of this contract would be non-negotiable. The news of this agreement was in newspapers and media around the world but received little if any attention in the United States.  Very few oil contracts were issued to US companies to develop this oil.  At least one oil company was told that they would have to have permission from Iran in order to to secure a contract for development.

But if we take that number for what it is, we get: $10 million x (4,400 American soldiers + 103,100 Iraqi citizens) = $1,075,000,000,000 or $1.075 trillion.'<br/><br/>That overlooks the fact that the value of human life varies according to its distance from America.  For example, for the price of a pizza, you could probably save the life of one Bangladeshi child or something by contributing to a charity concerning itself with -- say -- water filtration systems.<br/><br/>However, you'll get the pizza.  You would even resent it if the government proposed taking away your pizza money for the purpose discussed.<br/><br/>Your text's calculations probably assumed it was an AMERICAN life that was in question.  That might be worth ten million dollars.  On the other hand, a Greek life, for example, might be worth two million.  An Iraqi life?  Maybe five hundred dollars.<br/><br/>So we get $10 million x 4,400 American soldiers + $500 x 103,100 Iraqi citizens) = $44,051,550,000 or about $44 billion.'<br/><br/>Still not peanuts, but hardly the most significant component of the cost of the war.<br/><br/>Unless of course you happen to be one of the Iraqis in question.

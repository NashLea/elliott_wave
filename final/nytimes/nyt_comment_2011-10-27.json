This movie is a product designed for a night of family fun. Nonetheless Mila Jovovich and Christoph Waltz are capable of better. Usually if I don't see this delivered from good actors I hang the medal around the Director's neck. The performances on the whole just serve to make the script move. I would have preferred to not hear any of the characters speak but have Mathew Macfayden's rich vocal arsenal narrate the whole thing. Yet it was refreshing to behold a female swashbuckling character a la Jovovich in full 1700s French noble regalia execute aerial acrobatics through not one but two old standby booby trapped tunnels of peril to snatch that good old treasure and later fight off 15 swordsmen with more magical levitation and floatation. I always like to see one movie try something like wired fight choreography and then 150 other movies do the same exact thing. One more thing I can check off the list when choosing my entertainment. Special Thanks Hollywood for learning something from Chinese filmmaking and milking it to death. The swashbuckling factor however was pretty good in my opinion, as far as 3 Musketeers movies go.  <br/><br/>And to their credit the filmmakers were courageous in choosing the new Alexa digital camera by Arri instead of film or the Red camera. But for 3D the picture was not sharp and bright enough as with many films selling 3D. That is more due to 3D currently being an embarrassingly  terribly implemented technology. If you like paying extra for a picture that is not as bright and is less sharp than the regular non-3D version then pay for the 3D and go in with the hope of seeing a few shots that depict some poor excuse of an illusion of depth. 3D is an empty promise and waste of money on 99% of movies.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3287671, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/technology/personaltech/windows-phone-is-back-full-of-great-tricks-state-of-the-art.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4768914, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "Steve", "createDate": "1319687619", "userID": 30297861, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1319688472", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Westchester", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1319684872", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "Good for Microsoft, congratulations!<br/><br/>Now they need to go full-out supporting creation of apps, and planning for the versions of windows that will come out over the next 10 years.

Here is a possible framework for negotiation.<br /><br />1. Standard: He should be paid based on his market value going forward. A vehicle for rewarding him for past performance is discussed in 7 below.<br /><br />2. Elements of Value: His market value includes both playing and non-playing contributions.<br /><br />3. Playing Value: The playing contribution is unknown. We know that in general position players aged 36 perform worse than they did before. The reasonable approach is to pay based on his 2010 performance, with bonuses for reaching standards, perhaps 200 hits, .330 batting average, .450 slugging percentage, .400 on-base percentage, 20 home runs, .850 OPS+, and some fielding criterion (not the Golden Glove). So start by looking at what other shortstops are getting who are negotiating this year and had similar years. It appears that is well below $15 million per year for three years. Then look at players under contract. Hanley Ramirez (27-30 in 2011-2014) in comparison is getting $11 million for 2011 and ($57 million for 2011-2014). Jimmy Rollins (32 in 2011) is getting $8.5 million. It stretches credulity that Jeter could be worth much more as a player in 2011 than either of these all-stars.<br /><br />4. Non-playing value: The non-playing contribution is substantial. This is much more if he is a Yankee than if he is with another team. First, it is reasonable to conclude more tickets to Yankee games will be sold with Jeter as a Yankee (and that increment is greater than if he was with another team). If you assume 1000 tickets at $50.00 per ticket, that is $8,100,000 for 162 games. Some of that should go to Jeter. Second, his presence will help the Yankees sell more merchandise. How much more? The parties should be able to estimate and allocate some share to Jeter. Third, he improves the performance of the other players. How much? 5 games per year? 10? I don\u2019t know. But Jeter and the Yankees know roughly, and he should be compensated for that. If his performance declines further, all these contributions will shrink. Do these add $5 million to his value? $10 million?<br /><br />5. Babe Ruth: Per ESPN, Close told the New York Daily News on Sunday, \"There's a reason the Yankees themselves have stated Derek Jeter is their modern-day Babe Ruth.\u201d I Googled this and could not find the Yankees stating that. So I am assuming that is Mr. Close' opinion.<br /><br />Jeter is a Hall of Fame player. And I understand he is superior (from my perspective) to Ruth regarding alcohol and philandering. But doesn\u2019t Mr. Close realize that only Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio were close to Ruth in their value to the team?  A good analogy is saying Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski was a modern day Ted Williams. Equally absurd. There are levels of greatness and Jeter is in the second tier of Yankees. It is more accurate, and no small praise, to say Jeter is similar to Mantle and Berra in his value.<br /><br />6. Phased reductions after rejection of offer: If Close asked for $23-24 million for 4 or 5 seasons, it is a rejection of the Yankee\u2019s 3-year @$15 million offer. I think it is far more money than the above criteria indicate is reasonable. As a prior commenter suggested, the Yankees should reduce their offer by a fixed amount each week until agreement is reached. Based on the framework above, a base of $12 million for three years, plus incentives, is reasonable. (If disincentives were allowed, it would also be reasonable to reduce payment for failure to reach lesser goals.) As Cashman said, Jeter should test the market. Then he will likely return to the Yankees because of his greater value for that team.<br /><br />7. Trust fund: The Yankees paid him for prior performance. If not in violation of MLB rules or the collective bargaining agreement, the many fans who believe he should be paid in 2011 for his prior contributions could set up a trust fund or other facility to compensate him. 50,000 people could pay $100 per year for $5,000,000.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2120888, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/florida/fort-lauderdale/60055/pelican-grand-beach-resort/hotel-detail.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3082859, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1290927851", "userID": 942153, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290927851", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "userReview", "updateDate": "1290959951", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Oh no!

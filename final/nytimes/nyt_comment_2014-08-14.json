This effort has been unprecedented in size, scope and planning in American history. The amount of money spent is staggering, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, some of which went to \"encourage\" the tea party in 2009.<br/><br/>The gridblocking of the US House of representatives has but one purpose: the nullification of the election results of 2008 and 2012. It is designed to make Obama look weak and ineffective so that the opposition can go around complaining that he is weak and ineffective.<br/><br/>The attack on \"Obamacare\", likewise, has been unrelenting. Never before to my knowledge have elected US Senators taken an active role in trying to defeat passed and signed legislation, as happened when some Republican senators, in but one of many such moves, tried to stop the NFL from helping to provide information about the health care law. This was gross interference in executive authority.<br/><br/>On top of all this, we have an intelligent, capable president who seems to lack the ability to project executive authority (at times), instead talking about limitations and incremental change rather than sounding like the commander-in-chief.  When strength of will and action are needed, like now with the Israeli/Gaza war, Obama speaks of what we can't do.

So rare these days!  Universities now serve the purpose of sorting people into those who will do as they are told and those who won't.  Give up on yourself and study business (a process invented and evolved over time and then developed into the corporate model by people like Rockefeller Carnegie who did not go to college) and you will be a safe hire.  Programing a computer does not require education.<br/><br/>But despite having some insight, NK buys into the devaluation of education and the overvaluing of such things as smartphones and tablet as enrichments to our world.  Time will tell whether these things are neutral or, more likely, a distraction and detriment.  Schools interested in education ban students from using them.<br/><br/>To improve the economy we need to close the business schools, and put educated people back in charge, people with liberal educations in history, languages, literature, philosophy, mathematics, music, art.  A profound knowledge of medieval history from a rigorous liberal arts  BA is a better employment qualification than a prestigious MBA in Finance, and that includes for jobs in the financial sector.<br/><br/>And that is just a minor point.  Most importantly we will be better individually and as a society if we get back to real education.<br/><br/>So, Nick, good for you.  Try not to despair.  Maybe the universities can still be saved.

To me, it seems a bit of a replay of .the media's negativity towards her in 2008 as they swooned for Obama.  She's a smart and skillful politician and we could do much worse than having her as our elected president in 2016.  All of the negative commentary makes me wonder if the NYT and the commenters really would prefer that a really right wing Republican be elected as the next POTUS.

The would-be Emperor's policy plans, specific details, personal tax returns, or reasons why his personal money is in 23 offshore accounts, remain guarded mysteries. <br/><br/>Beyond partisan differences, and the huge leverage of money, the rabid extremes of the GOP base, something is deeply distributing about both Romney and Ryan. Their flaws are ignored by a media that doesn't challenge them and a public denied a voice in what is a one-sided conversation. Both silence and noise hide their desire for power without process. The substance of their campaign is a hollow promise: we have plans we refuse to disclose until we are elected. They are eager to use democracy to conceal their intent. They offer no covenant with voters. The keys to the national treasury and oversight of all of the nation's regulations and the protections of opportunity, merit, and aid in an open society are sought by default.<br/><br/>The party of voter ids is issuing policy blindfolds. Having no jobs bill or policy, they blindly want voters to believe that their tax cut policy will lift demand (without raising wages!). They propose government by chimera and charade.

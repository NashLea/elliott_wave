Well, it is my hope that if I work hard and write a solid dissertation, I will end up with a decent position at a college or university and a salary high enough to afford the monthly payments.  As for whether or not Columbia should have told me I was in \"deep doo doo\" - well, I worked hard to be there and I would not have listened.  Not to counselors, not to my parents.  Sorry, but I worked hard to get myself to Columbia and I felt special every time I set foot in a classroom or library; it was not an option to walk away for not being rich.<br /><br />I am confident that some day I will be debt-free, and after that point please believe I will be donating whatever I can to help students in the same position as I once was.  As for where to place the blame, I don't consider myself in need of \"blame,\" though I take responsibility.  It would also be nice if the government could cut us some more slack somewhere, be it with interest rates or tax cuts.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1503885, "replies": [], "lft": 574, "assetURL": "http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/assigning-responsibility-for-high-student-loan-debts/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2051561, "rgt": 575, "userDisplayName": "emu", "createDate": "1275103577", "userID": 35429727, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1275107850", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "VA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1275104250", "commentSequence": 262, "commentBody": "Well.... I had a similar major (Cultural Studies with a concentration in Philosophy (Continental) and Sociology (Women's Studies track))... but from a small state school where I incurred less than $20,000 debt.  I lived at home, worked two part-time jobs, had several scholarships, but still could not afford the tuition.  I also have a single mom who was financially incapable of paying for my education.  Yes, I was accepted at Smith College but chose not to attend because I knew I could not afford it.   But my education was invaluable and I do not regret studying a degree that is not marketable.<br />What am I doing now?  The economy sucks, I work part time as a home health aide while I'm in graduate school deferring student loan debt and gaining more education and job skills.  I hope to study Occupational Therapy next year, and when I graduate with a second MS degree I will have a decent enough salary to make a living and repay my debt.  I plan to take advantage of the IRB and to work with older adults or children with disabilities in order to minimize the years I have to repay (10 years, or 120 payments, versus some protracted repayment plans).<br />There are options out there, but you have to search for them.  Being 24 years old, I\u2019m not too worried \u2013 yet.  But I know I won\u2019t be able to afford a home, let alone children, in several years.  That is a sacrifice I am willing to make because (and perhaps this is selfishness on my part) I\u2019d rather feel fulfilled as a person and feel that I am assisting those in society who desperately need help than trying to make a million dollars in the financial sector by screwing over other people.  The meek shall inherit the earth?  That is something that Ms. Munna and I could both discuss eternally \u2013 and probably with a great deal more intelligence, compassion, and thoughtfulness than those contributing such harsh, judgmental \u2018advice\u2019.

Now, more than three decades later, I have still not found employment because of my college education, but rather through networking, self-taught skills and initiative.<br />My personal experiences have taught me to avoid debt and my recommendation to the younger generation is to proceed only with caution.

This is all about moral hazard. The reason why the banks don't care whether you can pay your loan back is because the government says you can't charge off student loans. They are basically the best kind of debt to invest in. We need to change this law. If you can charge off student loans in bankruptcy then the loan amounts will be much smaller and they will look at the student's ability to repay. If you give someone the ability to borrow unlimited amounts of money, they will always take it. Same with the colleges. Within the next 10 years many will begin applying for debt restructuring because no one will be dumb enough to pay their insane tuitions.

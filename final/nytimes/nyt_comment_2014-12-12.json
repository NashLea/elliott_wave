The proposition passed by a relatively narrow margin, the tipping yes vote coming from the eastern part of LA County -- Boyle Heights, El Monte, East LA -- 70-80%.  Those voters are largely Latino and Catholic, and Spanish language media (nearly a 50% share in the county) was flooded with a \u201cSi en Ocho, Protectar su Familia,\u201d (Yes on 8, to protect your family) message meme that propelled the passing.  If you take those precincts out of the equation, Prop 8 would have failed.  I never heard a Spanish language ad begging for a \u201cno\u201d vote.<br/><br/>There is a correlation in the current debate on policing in communities where people of color are targeted by aggressive law enforcement personnel.

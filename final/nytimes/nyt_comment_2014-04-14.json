In fact, I even acknowledged it with my questioning.  Is it the only patent ever issued to have an unlimited duration?  Obviously, the answer is no, as all patents have a limited lifetime.  However, whether or not a company decides to produce the invention protected by the patent, it will still be public knowledge.  In the vast majority of cases, these patents do not cover a period greater than the two decades following filing (and none are unlimited), and therefore, there will come a time when anyone, RoughAcres' father included, may freely make the invention described therein.  That time may even be now.<br/><br/>The realm of finance is very different from the realm of intellectual property covered by patents, because patents are intended to, and do, have a limited lifetime.  The knowledge the public gains from the publishing of patents lasts as long as we maintain a copy of the patent, the right of the patent holder to enforce the patent is not extended ad infinitum.

Having grown up in Europe myself, it was strange to find that, as a volunteer in their school, I found situations that I was not prepared for and didn't handle well.  Children were bussed in from other areas of the city, and they were hugely resentful and difficult, but their parents seemed equally concerned and involved.  Our problems start much earlier than any school.  The social strata, history and policy in the US will set some children back for generations to come, especially in certain states.  These states will drag down our statistics, and they do not seem interested in looking at their problems constructively on the state level.", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

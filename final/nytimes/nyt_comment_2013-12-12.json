Inequality is the severity of the gap between the poor and middle, and the middle and rich. Today, those who work the hardest are often paid the least, while those who work the least are paid the most (even when we exclude those in Congress). We have seen decades of upward wealth redistribution, and the results are seen in the dramatic deterioration of the US in virtually every respect. As much as it offends our egos, the US is no longer a world leader. While corporate profits have soared, the overall quality of life in the US has fallen from #1 when Reagan first took office, down to #11, and it's still falling, making the nations collapse likely. Why do you think that it isn't the poor who lose? It is impossible to address inequality/our overall economic condition while excluding the huge portion of the population in poverty.

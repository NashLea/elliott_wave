There are no losers here folks, as this is all voluntary.  Having played club and school at that age, I speak from experience as I'm sure others do.  My Div 1 college career didn't suffer, but I would have loved to see how good I could've been.  I'll never know, but these kids will find out if they have what it takes.

Neither will play high school soccer.  Both these boys want to play soccer in college.  The Academy is the best way to be seen and recruited by college coaches.  It has been estimated that 80% of today's college players come from the Academy system.  I have talked to several college coaches and they don't attend high school games... they go to major tournaments (Surf Cup, Dallas Cup) and Academy matches to find their recruits.  That is a simple fact of life.  With a few exceptions the high school teams are a mixture of player skills.  The elite players get frustrated on high school teams and the injuries are greater (in my experience) at the high school level than on the Academy teams.  If you are really good in high school you will get hacked.  Second, the Academy teams get top rate coaching.  High school coaching is inconsistent at best.  So, if you want to compete at the highest level, get recruited by a good college and play in a D1 program you play on an Academy team.  If you want to make the local newspaper and be a BMOC, then play high school soccer and hope that you don't get your ACL blown out..", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3309386, "replies": [], "lft": 385, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/sports/soccer/soccers-all-year-model-forces-high-school-players-to-choose.html", "parentID": 5664182, "commentID": 5665372, "rgt": 386, "userDisplayName": "giacomo carletta", "createDate": "1330892386", "userID": 31724800, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1330923734", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "A pretty decent planet, normally", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1330923734", "commentSequence": 42, "commentBody": "Aaron, well said, can't deny any of your points, but remember that there are several potential paths to success in soccer in the US.

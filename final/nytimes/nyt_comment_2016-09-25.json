In the 3-part description, one element was the traditional use of the tree's wood to make longbows. Therefore, I wrote YEW on the answer sheet without consulting my teammates. Why? Because YEW appears in crosswords as an archer's wood. Is YEW CROSSWORDESE? Not to me. Our bill was over $100 with tip. Another team member had also offered to pay, in honor of our teammate who was moving back to SF the next morning, so our pre-arrangement was that I would pay $90 and my teammate could pay the rest.<br/><br/>We won by one point. That point was for YEW. I saved 22% off my $90 contribution after the team voted that I should reap the benefit of the SCRIP.

Even were we to overlook the contributions of his staff and other corporate officers, the fact of the matter is that it was Mr. Trump's father who built that company from the ground up and who passed it along as an inheritance to his Donald and his siblings. Has anyone ever heard him even mention his old man?  How many of us, whatever our political convictions, would take credit for the accomplishments of our parents?<br/>Suggestion# 2: Lie.  Kind of.  If things get really tight Monday, why not do what The Donald himself does virtually every time he opens his mouth? If it's okay for Mr. Trump to have libeled the incumbent President of the United States with the falsehood that he was born abroad even after he presented his U.S. birth certificate, why not simply announce that your opponent has paid absolutely no taxes for a period of, say, ten years?  More than likely, this allegation would prove accurate. In any case, the only way it could be shown to be false is via the submission of Mr. Trump's tax returns. Let's get real: there's only one reason why The Donald hasn't released them by now. Either he accepts Hillary's allegation or he submits the t/r's.

Foreign words are always tricky, I think acceptance as an answer depends on how widespread the usage, and even that can be questionable. Rucola (Italian for \"arugula\") didn't make the cut in the Times' answer key and I'm ok with that. In earlier Bees, rigatoni, cannelloni, and celli (plural of cello) did make the cut, and I agree with that. Similarly, coloratura describes some of the most famous sopranos of all time...Beverly Sills, Kathleen Battle, Maria Callas, Joan Sutherland, et. al., and one need not be a classical music buff to have had reasonable opportunity to encounter that word...although I did take special pleasure when I found it in the Bee."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 19332580, "replies": [], "commentID": 19487601, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Judith", "createDate": "1471205261", "userID": 62593687, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1471205286", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "MTF Tobin", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "<br/>", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1471201686", "commentSequence": 19487601, "commentBody": "Please, please, please print Spelling Bee.

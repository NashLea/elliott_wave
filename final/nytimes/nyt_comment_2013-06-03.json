This narrow hold on power, combined with the phony filibuster rules in the Senate, gives the Republicans a partial veto over legislation. They have expanded that minimal power by roadblocking the most basic laws needed to continue American govt., but the voters have not punished them because, one, the media has misreported the story and, two, the voters have been fed a steady stream of misinformation about the national debt. <br/><br/>Combined with the rise of thousands of right wing talk radio stations, right wing only websites and the clear distortion offered as news by the Fox News channel, and we are in deep do do, to use an expression George Bush the first seemed to like.

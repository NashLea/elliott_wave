But my grands and parents knew I was supposed to go to school and would have punished me if I cut.  My father may not have been able to help with homework but he knew I should do it and made sure I did.<br/><br/>Frazier's mom is not so naive not to know he should have been going to school.  She lied about her rent to put sports above academics. I have great empathy for kids who grow up in an environment that does not value academics.  They have it harder than affluent kids.  But they know right and wrong regarding school.  They have teachers willing to put in extra hours to help them succeed.  <br/><br/>My kid was no academic star, either.   He went to school in the worst-performing school system in the state.  But he had math and science teachers who tutored before and after school. I forced him to go. I encouraged the best preparation for any life endeavor:  READ, READ, READ  Public libraries are free. Couldn't Frazier's mom and he, himself, have used them? Lots of complicity here. Blaming only racism is itself racism that sells kids short without forcing them to try.

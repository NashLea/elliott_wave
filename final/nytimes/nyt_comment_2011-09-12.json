Everyone should know this.<br/><br/>My favorite is when Gallup polls \"who makes up the tea party.\" It always comes out that they are wealthy, very well educated people. Have you ever seen who is bussed into a tea party rally? Let's just say they are the people that most need government assistance to get back on their feet. They rarely comb their hair and they wear sandals with socks, true marks of a Harvard education.   <br/><br/> Gallup's Frank Newport doesn't like President Obama and so he wrote the most whiny article I've ever read. At one point he said something like \"the President must think the American people are too stupid to understand this policy.\" Now please, how could he have any idea what the President is thinking. The hallmark of a Newport article is petulance. It is embarrassing--for me--to read him. I just cringe at a grown man being so obviously such a petulant child. Are his \"questions\" ever going to be neutral?<br/><br/>The larger picture is--do we want people in Congress to be trying to figure out how not to look so obstructionist? No--we want people to be figuring out how best to fix America. There is no sign that republicans, if back in power, will put America first. There are zillions of signs that they will just continue as before the \"great interruption\" known as Obama. <br/><br/>A big fundamentalist goal is marginalizing women--the fundamentalist evangelicals that populate the tea party want no birth control. Forget abortion, they would stop the manufacture of birth control. Think no one would stand for this? The Catholic church allows no birth control. Our only hope in that case would be a powerful drug company lobby. How ironic. Not to mention that I think a majority of Supreme Court justices are now Catholic. Only one more justice needed for complete control and we're back to women with 12 children. <br/><br/>Thanks again Nate, for a great read.

Barca can play this (and often do even when they don't line up that way) because their defense is conducted in the opponent's half. Zanetti, Lucio, and Samuel are strong defenders but are just too old and slow these days, especially for a 3 man defense, and so is Cambiasso screening. On the other end, the 3 person attack was barely 2.5 since Forlan was hardly involved, but if and when he does get involved that means that the squad is going to get stretched front to back (since the slow back line cannot press high) and there will be huge gaps all over the place. This was a problem Rafa and Leonardo never solved. Only Mourinho figured out that his only viable option was to sit deep, pack the defense, and play the counter (and that was with a 2 year younger back line). They really needed to get some youth in defense, and all they have is Ranocchia, who isn't quite ready yet. They got a ton of money from Eto'o and Pandev, and didn't fix a problem that's getting on three years old now. <br/><br/>I was also confused by the Zarate business. I can only guess Gasperini was sitting Sneijder and Pazzini for the CL match Wednesday against the world power that is Trabzonspor. Then again, if they play like this, Trabzonspor might give them more than they bargained for ...<br/><br/>On the plus side, that was a, um, reJuvenated Juventus Saturday.

He has also said many wonderful things about Djokovic. You have to recognize his press conference was almost immediately after perhaps the toughest loss of his career, which was made tougher because he lost like this 2nd year in a row! Given him a break rather than parse his every word (when he was clearly upset at the loss) and judge his character on its basis. Frankly, both players deserved to win but there can be only one winner. Even Nadal said in his press conference, Federer was very unlucky not to win after having 2 match points on his serve.", "recommendationCount": 11}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

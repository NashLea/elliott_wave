Yes you have to buy medigap or part D, so get over it. Medicaid is supposed to take care of the poor. Nobody including Obama has a viable replacement. The US simply cannot embrace Universal healthcare where everyone is cared for. Too too many interest groups. AMA wants to keep their income levels, INsurance companies thrive on not approving claims , hospitols group together to improve earnings. Am sure there are more as possibly independent test labs. Very very big business. With all the boomers heading into the social security bracket the medical complex will only expand.

So he thinks we should open health savings accounts and squirrel away dollars for the \"end\".  We also have to save for retirement and our kids college educations, too.  Since the government will no longer pay for that, either.  <br/><br/>That means only the wealthy will die in hospitals, have their kids go to college, or retire before they die.  <br/><br/>The rest of us will die in our beds (or give birth there or bleed to death on the street after an accident), work till we die and never go to college.  <br/><br/>Whee!

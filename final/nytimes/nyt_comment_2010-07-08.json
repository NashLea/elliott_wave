I predicted (in the Letters Pages of the Southampton Daily Echo 8th July) that Italy would win on penalties (I\u2019ve posted this letter separately). This year German morale has collapsed. Germans are tired of supporting the failing Euro and Germany is close to leaving. The whole future of the Euro and the EU hinges on a German victory. The stakes are enormous! To stop Germany leaving the Euro, the EU must boost German morale URGENTLY. Germany MUST win. There is no other outcome.

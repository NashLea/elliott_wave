There are many alternatives for reducing cardiovascular disease risk than drinking alcohol.  On the other hand, all cancer authorities, including the World Health Organization, have identified all forms of alcohol as a carcinogen.  (One criteria for being a carcinogen is that higher intake or exposure results in higher cancer risk.)  Researchers have known for years that alcohol can cause breast cancer, along with many other cancers.  While the focus of the low heart disease rates in France has been on the consumption of wine, few discussed the high breast cancer rates among males (in France).  Like other cancers, breast cancer affects both men and women.  Alcohol is a part of our society and is not going away.  If a person chooses to drink any form of alcohol, it would be a good strategy to keep the intake small and infrequent.  Additionally, a good strategy would include reducing other cancer risks, such as smoking, consuming, inhaling, or absorbing known carcinogens (check World Health Organization for list).  Disease risk reduction is a personal matter.  It would be nice if everyone could avoid cancer, heart disease, alzheimers, etc. throughout their lifetimes.  However, many people believe that bad things always happen to \"the other guy\".  Some people also never want to hear what can be considered as \"bad news\" and they need a reason to continue doing what they like. Cancer is the most expensive disease a person can get, given the cost of drugs and lengths of treatment.  It seems that family members should have some say in a person's lifestyle if it may lead to negative financial consequences at a future date?  Even the most lucrative pension may not be enough to pay for treatment if a person is lucky enough to live with cancer.

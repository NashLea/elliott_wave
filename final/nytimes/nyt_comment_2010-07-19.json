The beautifully haunting pictures remind me of shining my own  flashlight on the faces of people I would meet at night.  I have come to call the moon (whenever I see it here in Brooklyn) an African moon because I know it is lighting up the lives of my family and friends in Ghana when there is not electricity to do so.

Given that we've produced 90% of carbon in the atmosphere that is now warming the planet, it is we who must make act with no delay to solve the problem. Of course, inherent in any effective solution is implementing diverse, integrated and concerted approaches that must be continually renewed regardless of administration changes. Approaches should include conserving a lot and generating a lot of what we must use from the sun and the wind.<br /><br />But first, we as a nation must be convinced that we are near the beaker's boiling point. I fear your readers and commenters are not representive of mainstream thinking on this topic which has been as other commenters point out heavily influenced by the Bush legacy of denial and inaction (really worse than inaction, but that is another topic).<br /><br />What will it take to change the way people think about energy consumption, and its impact on today and tomorrow's weather? And to convince individuals that they have a meaningful role in curbing consumption of energy and switching to alternate fuel sources where possible?<br /><br />The classic Health Belief Model states that people must believe they are susceptible to a threat and that the consequences are serious. Yet in order to take action, they must also believe the barriers to action (like using less electricity) are easily overcome and that there are immediate rewards to taking a desired action (like an energy rebate, as Mr. Kristof suggests).<br /><br />There are several missing links in establishing the global warming threat in the minds of many Americans. It seems like a partnership between industry and non-profits could launch an educational campaign to reinforce the (immediate) threat that all people are quite susceptible to (shrinking glaciers = hotter summers in 2010, and increasingly extreme storms that kill people). If people saw the images that Mr. Breashers sees at regular intervals, on TV, on buses, on billboards, more people would be willing to acknowledge that global warming is clearly happening now at a very rapid pace.<br /><br />To be effective, campaigners conveying this serious and tangible threat must use them alongside a menu of actions that can make a difference. Action should include policy changes at the national level (global players are also important to avert future warming, but let's get real--Americans are responsible for nearly all of the climate change now occurring). Action should definitely also include changes at the personal level because that is how people come to realize they can use less energy, and it's really not that hard. Small actions pave the way for supporting bigger, meaningful reforms in the way we as a nation utilize energy.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 1661782, "replies": [], "lft": 192, "assetURL": "http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/the-roof-of-the-world-melting/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2275283, "rgt": 193, "userDisplayName": "Frederick George", "createDate": "1279510350", "userID": 33751998, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1279512485", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Portland,  Oregon", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1279508885", "commentSequence": 92, "commentBody": "I've said to many that DENIAL is not only a trait shared by people for millennia globally but common enough today.

Since the beginning of 2010, 124 rhinos have been killed in just South Africa.  5 of the 124 rhinos were Black Rhinos, which are on the endangered species list. As of right now, rhino poaching has passed last years total of 122 .This article got  me thinking about what people are doing to stop this increase in rhino poaching.<br />Some national parks in South Africa have upgraded their equipment to keep up with poacher\u2019s technology. The national parks now have night-vision equipment, modern radio equipment, and sometimes use tracking devices on the rhinos <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/south-africa/100714/south-african-rhinos-under-fire?page=0,0))\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/south-africa/100714/south-african-rhinos-under-fire?page=0,0))</a> .Krueger National park is one of the hardest hit parks in Africa, they have lost 33 rhinos.<br />The National Wildlife Crime Reaction Unit (NWCRU) was developed to get a handle on this increase in rhino poaching (<a href=\"http://www.sanparks.org/about/news/2010/may/rhino_poaching.php).\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sanparks.org/about/news/2010/may/rhino_poaching.php).</a> The NWCRU is made up of people from the SAPS (South African police service) Organised Crime Unit, SAN (South African National) Parks Environmental Crime Unit, the Provincial Conservation Anti-Poaching Unit and Prosecutors at a national and provincial level.  The NWCRU was developed to help speed up the prosecuting process of suspected poachers. Right now there are about 25 suspected poachers that have been arrested (<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2010/05/29/poaching_of_rhinos_in_s_africa_on_rise/).\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2010/05/29/poaching_of_rhinos_in_s_africa_on_rise/).</a><br />The most recent conviction was that of Xuan Hoang. On March 29, 2010 Hoang was arrested at Tambo International Airport for possession of 7 rhino horns. Hoang was convicted on June 30, 2010 . He was sentences to 10 years imprisonment (<a href=\"https://www.givengain.com/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&amp;cause_id=2347&amp;news_id=89308).\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.givengain.com/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&amp;cause_id=2347&amp;news_id=89308).</a><br />The head of Endangered Wildlife Trust\u2019s Rhinos Security project Faan Coetzee, works with private land owners on protecting their rhinos. He suggests that land owners should have some one who will watch over the rhino\u2019s full time (rhino monitors). These rhino monitors should not keep the same patrol patterns; this will make it hard to poachers to learn their patterns. Because the price for rhino horns is so enticing, rhino monitors should be watched carefully because poachers may try to bribe them.  Also, Coetzee suggest that landowners and rhino monitors keep a camera on them at all times to be able to collect evidence if needed. Pictures may be needed to convict a poacher.<br />Another step both private land owners and reserves are taking to protect rhinos is dehorning them.  They believe that by dehorning rhinos decreases their chances of being targeted by poachers.  Unfortunately, Dehorning does not fully protect rhinos from poachers, because the horn cannot be entirely removed. Also poachers work at night, so sometimes poachers cannot tell if the rhino has been dehorned or not (<a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/south-africa/100714/south-african-rhinos-under-fire?page=0,1).\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/south-africa/100714/south-african-rhinos-under-fire?page=0,1).</a><br /><br />-Jana Caine", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1664039, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/opinion/19krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2275044, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "EXPATRIATE AMERICAN", "createDate": "1279505440", "userID": 60716343, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1279513842", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "TIEN SHAN MOUNTAINS, KYRGYZSTAN", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1279510242", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Paul, it is not a one or the other proposition.

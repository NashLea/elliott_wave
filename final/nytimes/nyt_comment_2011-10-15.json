Just as it seeks to dispell the \"orthodoxy\" of Moneyball thinking, however, it's wrong, and more flash than substance.<br/><br/>In fact, what Moneyball and its following era have done was simply to reinforce a fact in baseball that, for a time, was overshadowed by the big-market, spendthrift thinking, namely, that the crucial element in putting together a great baseball team isn't money or statistics or scouting, but, above all, a shrewd, experienced and skilled manager.  Billy Beane didn't prove that one can always put together a winner with limited resources; he proved that the best managers can do far better with far less than just create losers.<br/><br/>As Tim Elas and others have pointed out, the Rays have continued to succeed in a tiny market, mainly because of the skills and acumen of their managers.<br/><br/>The Baseball Prospectus article linked to is fascinating. However, it only reinforces the argument that smaller payrolls handicap teams and, beyond that, it points this out as a historical phenomenon, dating to the turn of the 20th century. In other words, it provides evidence directly controverting Mr. Mahler's thesis. <br/><br/>None of the teams in the current playoffs would have got here if ownership hadn't been willing to increase their payrolls to improve the teams midway into the seasons. In other words, the owners's support was necessary (but not sufficient) for the teams to get further.<br/><br/>The real takeaway from all of this is that a team which doesn't have the support of its ownership is likely to continue to fail. In addition, no matter how much money someone throws at the problem, this won't necessary solve systemic deficiencies or poor decision making by GMs. The Mets failed not because of a lack of resources, but because Minaya didn't know what he was doing. Guess how orthodox and conventional this all sounds?", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3285936, "replies": [], "lft": 618, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/us/kansas-city-bishop-indicted-in-reporting-of-abuse-by-priest.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4701534, "rgt": 619, "userDisplayName": "Woz", "createDate": "1318636349", "userID": 824517, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1318653796", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1318650196", "commentSequence": 199, "commentBody": "It's the same as the unions that protect their members, police, teachers, local, state and federal goverment officals.

How about the ill, the elderly, and people who've suffered grievous injuries? Nope, they don't count. \r<br/><br/>Repubicans side with the for-profits, because they lack the insight to recognize that they, too, might one day be old, or ill, or injured--or that this could happen to a family member of theirs.

And then you are a Medicaid patient with little clout.  States are enacting \"look back\" laws so you can't give your money/assets to your kids to avoid truly being indigent.

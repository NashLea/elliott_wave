However, despite some conservative rhetoric, we have a living Constitution - even aside from the amendment process, the interpretation of the text changes over time to meet the needs and understandings of new generations.<br/>The interpretation of the Second Amendment is an example of how this works: at the time it was written, and up until quite recently, it was understood to be about militias - if individuals were permitted to own guns, it wasn't because of any constitutional right, it was simply because nobody wanted to take them away. Then, recently, the amendment was reinterpreted to refer to personal self defense, instead of militia service, and that is how the matter stands now. And in fact, this seems to reflect the general view of the American people, so as a constitutional issue, it makes sense.<br/>We might wish that people thought differently about how self-defense works, but that is a different question.<br/>Talking about old-time militias would only be relevant if you were arguing with someone who was a real fanatic about the \"original intent\" of the writers of the Constitution.

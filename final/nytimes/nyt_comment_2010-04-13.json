After a while most apps will be developed through Adobe CS5 since it is convenient for developers. Adobe is not just the manufacturer of flash, they are much more than that with very big ambitions. They want to have developers developing with their meta layer, so they control the app development platform for many run time platforms without having to do anything regarding the run time platform, its design or distribution and popularity of it. Assume CS5 is the de facto app development platform for Android devices, Google is subservient to Adobe and they need to make sure future Android is compatible with CS5 so as not to piss off the consumers.<br /><br />Again, this may all be fine with Google since all they seem to care is have their little space to put their ads.

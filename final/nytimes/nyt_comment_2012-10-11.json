Even though I sat still and behaved, I lost all my personality and became very obsessive. Docs diagnosed any side effects as other disorders. I feel that being on Ritalin for that long has also given me long term, treatment resistant depression. Depression started in fourth grade and I was on anti-depressants by the time I was fifteen. While doctors may brush that off as a comorbid disorder, I would like to point out that drugs that act similarly in the brain such as cocaine and meth can cause the same result with long-term use. Studies on rats done in 2003 suggest that Ritalin use during the juvenile years may lead to depression later in life. In these studies, researchers from Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital and the University of Texas Southwestern administered the drug to normal juvenile rats and discovered that depressive symptoms and decreased ability to experience pleasure could be found in these rats in adulthood. The medication seems to permanently alter the animals' brains, leading scientists to speculate whether the same thing might happen to children who take this drug.

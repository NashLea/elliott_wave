When the first explosion happened at the Fukushima plant, they didn't even report it to the goverment. When the PM saw the explosion on TV, he reportedly called then and had to bawl them out in order to pry the details about the explosion out of them. Because it is so big and because over the years it made so many donations to the old conservative party (the LDP), which ruled for half a century, Tokyo Electric has developed a culture of self-centeredness, arrogance, and lack of accountability. Now, however, the Japan Democratic Party is in power, so the government may actually be able to change the balance of power and demand accountability and a safety-first policy at Tokyo Electric.<br /><br />The Japanese government also needs to demand that Tokyo Electric build strong tsunami-deflecting shields in front of all its seaside reactors. The Fukushima plant has almost nothing to deflect tsunamis to the side, and the emergency power generators were built outside the plant walls, between the plant and the ocean, so they naturally were damaged by the tsunamis. Many Japanese are saying that this was a human-caused disaster as well as a natural disaster. Much tighter regulation of Tokyo Electric and a thorough investigation of the breakdown are called for. Plenty of strong earthquakes will occur in the future, and Tokyo Electric obviously isn't prepared for them.

There will be a series of reasons, both proximate (sticking valves, operator errors, slow response) and ultimate (siting, design, and such).<br />     What can we say at this point about the failure to design for an earthquake-tsunami one-two punch?<br /> 1.    The safety systems detected the earthquake and, as designed or subsequently modified, shut down the chain reaction to below criticality. But tsunami warnings should also trip a shutdown: were they available?<br /> 2.    The earthquake might have damaged some systems, e.g., might have drained some of the 10m-deep pool at Number 4 holding removed fuel rods.<br /> 3.    The tsunami overtopped the sea walls built to protect the installation. That constitutes an obvious siting and design insufficiency, given Fukushima was near a subduction zone that generates tsunamis. These were errors made forty years ago by Tokyo Electric Power and the Japanese regulators.<br /> 4.    Because basement electrical control rooms were flooded by the tsunami, backup power failed and batteries were only good for four hours. Some sensor data and control functions were lost. Another obvious design insufficiency, easily avoided by locating this room on a higher floor.<br /> 5.    The Fukushima boiling-water reactors were designed by G.E. in the 1960s to be cheaper than the dominant design, the pressurized water reactor. But its slimmed-down containment was heavily criticized in the early 1970s for safety reasons that are likely to be relevant to the Fukushima disasters.<br /> 6.    About one-fourth of the U.S. reactors in operation today are of this cheaper G.E. Mark I design. The Chernobyl reactor that melted down in 1986 was a much cheaper Soviet design; not only did it not have a containment but the reactor was surrounded by very flammable graphite, what caused the building to burn for a month while lofting radioactive particles up to 30,000 feet to create fallout over a far wider area than anything likely from the multiple Daiichi disasters.<br /> 7.    As Matt Wald notes, \u201cOne simple improvement, in use now in most plants, is to keep some spent fuel in \u201cdry casks\u201d \u2014 steel cylinders filled with inert gas, sitting in small concrete silos. These have no moving parts and are unlikely to be bothered by earthquakes or tsunamis.\u201d It sounds as if Tokyo Electric Power and the Japanese regulators failed to update their fuel-handling.<br /> 8.    Most of the four hundred reactors operating in the world today are of the more robust pressurized water design and most are not threatened by tsunamis, so many of the lessons of Fukushima may not prove relevant to them.<br /> 9.    Most of the reactors currently being constructed have forty additional years of operating experience and safety research to guide them. (The G.E. Mark I represented only ten years of commercial nuclear power experience.)<br /><br />While the use of coal for electricity generation appears cheap, that is only because we take so little account of its hidden costs (climate change), pollution (coal-fired plants put more uranium into the air each year than all of the uranium consumed in nuclear reactors), and miner deaths. In China alone, there are an estimated 5,000 miner deaths each year. For hydroelectric, there are dam failures that wipe out downstream towns. Per megawatt generated, the hydro fatality rate around the world is a hundred times higher than for nuclear electricity.<br />     For commercial nuclear power, the death toll was about 50 in the first fifty years, all from Chernobyl. One death per year, on average. While Daiichi has already added perhaps a dozen to that total, it is clear that nuclear is still, by far, our safest method of generating electricity.<br /><br />The nuclear contamination downwind of a damaged reactor must be compared to those of other industrial plants, say those for agricultural chemicals.<br />     The 1984 Bhopal disaster was the world's worst industrial catastrophe with perhaps 15,000 deaths and a half-million injuries from the leak of methyl isocyanate gas in to the air, which went undetected for a week.<br />     Such facilities get little of the design and regulatory oversight that characterizes the nuclear power industry. Nuclear power is not inherently safer so much as it has been made mostly safe by foresight.<br />     Were not nuclear power associated in peoples\u2019 minds with something far scarier, nuclear bombs, we would have treated it about like we treat a pesticide plant. But I wouldn\u2019t downgrade the nuclear power precautions; instead I would upgrade the safety requirements and disaster plans for many manufacturing operations that can generate fallout from a fire or leak.<br /><br />---<br />I reviewed the relative safety of various power sources in Chapter 19 of my 2008 book, GLOBAL FEVER: How to Treat Climate Change.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 2536798, "replies": [], "lft": 68, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/complexity-complacency-calamity/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3564463, "rgt": 69, "userDisplayName": "chris y", "createDate": "1300642412", "userID": 58951348, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300680567", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "florida", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300676967", "commentSequence": 33, "commentBody": "re #29, daniel shays- \"Too bad the NRC both \"regulates\" AND promotes nuclear energy.

First and foremost, this one:<br /><br />\u201cOur success as a species testifies that, in the long term, we have balanced those risks and rewards well.\u201d<br /><br />We have balanced nothing. Where the heck are you living? We are headed for or are already into the Sixth Extinction period; an epic event. We are sending millions of non human species over the cliff. Fifty percent of the world\u2019s animals are in decline. One-quarter of the world\u2019s mammals face extinction. Just to name a few of those species: the elephant, humpback whale, gorilla, orangutan, spider monkey, cheetah, tiger, and polar bear. That is not success, dear friend, that is tyranny and ecocide. There is nothing balanced in that equation. And the animals I mentioned tend to be the one\u2019s most people recognize. There are millions more we haven\u2019t even identified and named yet but are already on their way out. And I didn't even mention the indigenous tribes whose lands we've stolen and poisoned.<br /><br />Where I might use the word \u201csuccess\u201d, though in truth it is anything but, is in our ability to wage war against nature in some of the most sophisticated, technological and brutal ways ever to hit this planet. This is the first time in history any species has been called a \u201cgeophysical force.\u201d We don\u2019t play fair Dale. There is nothing balanced about our presence or energy extraction practices. Our human numbers are staggering and oppressive and killing everything else. Maybe if there were only two billion humans on the planet I might agree with some of what you say. But we passed that number less than one hundred years ago. There are close to seven billion needy, hungry, energy consuming humans, one of which is myself, and I hate what we\u2019re doing to this planet. I hate what I\u2018m doing to the planet. We are living at the expense of everything else. So have we weighed the risks well? Answer: a big, fat resounding NO. Every other living thing is at our mercy. The biggest tragedy in that statement is we aren\u2019t going to change. We have little mercy toward anything but ourselves.  That is not a sapient species.<br /><br />And finally:<br /><br />\u201cThey do not want your pity, or your guilt. They are proud of what they do. They know they make modern life possible. They know that their wages are higher than the average, to compensate them for the extra risks they take. They know they earn those wages, and they set about doing their dangerous work as safely as possible.\u201d<br /><br />Have you ever listened to the interviews of the workers when a coal mine collapses or the people in the vicinities of those mountain top removal zones when they discover their entire neighborhoods have been polluted and poisoned to equal birth defects and contamination into future generations thanks to our fossil fuel industries? Come on Dale, please stop painting a magical picture of coal miners.<br /><br />I have never heard any one of those people talk about an eagerness to resume their work or continue with their proud, poisonous vocations when the s--t hit\u2019s the fan. . And what I\u2019m about to propose will sound demeaning and disparaging, I do not mean it that way. But in the same way you\u2019re calling those of us who care about the planet and energy extraction \u201cmagical\u201d in our thinking, what magic pill are you taking that suggests these men even think deeply and consciously about what they\u2019re doing? Most of them have not gone beyond high school, if they have. They\u2019ve followed in the footsteps of their parents and blindly do what they\u2019ve been slated to do because there are no other lucrative jobs that pay living wages or offer the kind of insurances and benefit packages in those extremely depressed demographics. Is it their fault? Of course not. There are no other viable options. My point in bringing up the level of education with those workers, and their life perspectives is simply this: notice it isn\u2019t the well educated, ivy league graduate CEO\u2019s or their minions from Peabody Coal going deep into the mines. Not on your life. It\u2019s much easier to pay less educated, less sophisticated citizens to do the dirty work. And I'm sorry if that sounds unkind, I'm not trying to be unkind. I'm raising attention to how easily taken advantage of many of the mine workers are by duplicitious, greed oriented brutes, aka, CEO's.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know what the answers are but I sure as hell am not going to stop questioning how we get our energy, why it is we can\u2019t make a partial transition off dirty energy into clean energy, or how many is too many people on planet Earth. I may not be able to make any difference but I\u2019m sure as hell not going to stop questioning how we want to live as a species so other sentient beings can just plain live.<br /><br />Elizabeth Tjader<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 2541132, "replies": [], "lft": 40, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/was-tokyo-electric-singing-hestiation-blues/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3565724, "rgt": 41, "userDisplayName": "JD", "createDate": "1300667667", "userID": 1266283, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300680651", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Ohio", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300677051", "commentSequence": 17, "commentBody": "If executives failed to cool the plant for financial reasons, their actions are despicable.

We don't actually know what the emergency plan was, but presumably it was based on the GE operating manuals which cover emergencies as well as normal operations, and which call for flooding the reactor under very specific circumstances.  \"get untrained soldiers involved dumping water on the reactor\" isn't part of any rational emergency plan, and I'm sure not TEPCO's, which is why they weren't called in until later.  The operators are supposed to react to emergencies *before* they get out of control, and if that requires sacrificing the reactors, they're supposed to sacrifice the reactors.<br /><br />I think an honest post-mortem is very likely to find what's being suspected, that hesitation rather than following the book allowed things to escalate, in particular, not flooding the reactors while they still had power to do so as is suggested by the NY Times article.<br /><br />Steven Earl:<br /><br />It is all about the profits........<br /><br />Imagine yourself going through a strong earthquake and tsunami event, not as bad as those worse hit, but a worse combination than anything anyone in the continental US has gone through.<br /><br />Also, imagine that you're a manager of the plant. First of all, after such an event, the people onsite may've been fairly low-level.  Secondly, even the plant manager's fairly low on the TEPCO hierarchy.  Now at the moment, the plant has appeared to survive.  Power's out, from all indications cell phone and landline communications were totally disrupted throughout much of NE Japan.<br /><br />I'd say there's a good chance that the decision to trash the three operating reactors by flooding them with sea water would fall on *your* imaginary shoulders given the state of affairs.<br /><br />That's a lot of responsibility.  Hesitation to follow the book isn't that surprising, and doesn't have to invoke \"evil profit mindedness\" etc.  It's not at all clear that upper TEPCO management was necessarily involved at the time when the decision had to have been made.<br /><br />It's not entirely clear if, at first, upper TEPCO management was being dishonestly vague about what was going on, or whether they simply had no clue.  I had the impression that \"had no clue\" was the situation.

Honestly, in the U.S., the average American is exposed to more radiation just going through airport security than what the radiation poisoning of Japanese food will add to their daily amount. If anything, eating that irradiated milk would be SAFER than going through airport security (it doesn't create a giant bottleneck that would be perfect for a suicide bomber to take out dozens of lives, damage valuable equipment, and shut down air travel for days or weeks on end when police respond). And you certainly risk far more radiation poisoning every time you visit the doctor or dentist.<br /><br />But, really, consider this: It wasn't the reactors that put Japan in this situation. It was the gasoline generators. If they had continued operating as per design, they would have shut down properly, the cooling pools would still be active, and the entire operation would be contained until Japan stepped in to either shut it down entirely or repair it and start it back up.<br /><br />Essentially, the safety protocols of the nuclear plant worked as designed and did the intended jobs... up until the generators failed. So the fault lies with whoever was in charge of the gasoline generators, not the people in charge of the nuclear reactors.<br /><br />#32 Doris<br /><br />Because it was. That a tsunami would strike was foreseen in the reactor design; note that none of the reactors were damaged by the tsunami and shutdown as intended. What was not foreseen was the tsunami taking out the generators, which had been added as a design safety feature in case an earthquake or tsunami damaged the main power grid. In effect, they planned for such an event as this to happen, set things up for this event, and still had one thing they didn't anticipate happen.<br /><br />Oh, and don't bother to say that they should have had more generators, put the generators elsewhere, etc. In all of those options, the generators could still have been taken out by the tsunami itself. The only safe place to put the generators would have been inside the actual reactors, and I think any intelligent person can see why that placement is a VERY BAD IDEA.<br /><br />We're on a planet with an active weather system; this means the worst possible thing is guaranteed to happen at least once. You can plan for it, but all you end up doing is changing what the worst possible thing is. And if you think this is bad, try imagining how much worse this could be if the plant instead used hydrogen power (hint: goodbye Tokyo), solar panels (most of them use highly toxic chemicals that could potentially do effectively-permanent environmental damage), or coal or oil for power.

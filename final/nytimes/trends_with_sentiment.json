If Apple could accomplish their goals by selling magic elves, they would be selling magic elves.<br /><br />Apple asks a simple question:  What will make a little box useful to a lot of people?  In the case of an iPhone, it's apps for  browsing, music, email, weather, maps, contacts, photos, etc.  Apple moves down the list and builds a device that will do all of that fairly well.  They construct a touch screen equal to the task of making people happy while they use all those useful apps.  They painstakingly construct a simple regimen around that touch screen to make it simple and stress-free to use.  When all of this is assembled, they ask:  Can this box be sold at a price that the public will accept?  If so, it's sold.  If not, the design goes back on the shelf until technology prices drop.<br /><br />What about multitasking, USB ports, printing, etc?  If NONE of those are required to deliver the feature list to the customer, they're not important.  A USB port is essential for syncing, but not for browsing.

What good is printing when most of my time is spent in meetings, a car, train or restaurant.  In my office, my PC can print documents.<br /><br />Techies throw these features out, but just what do they mean to most people?  Why should I need 4 USB ports?  I don't even use 4 USB ports on my home computer.  All my peripherals are wireless!  Multitasking?  Great on my office computer, where I can open 6 windows and cycle through everything.

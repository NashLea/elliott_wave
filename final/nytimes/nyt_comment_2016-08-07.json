I suspect we will be subjected to more of the same of Republican obstructionism unless and until we get more moderate Republicans in Congress.  I also suspect that a Supreme Court nomination by Clinton would  go nowhere, as well.  Some Republicans are supporting Trump in the hopes he will be elected, and they can swing the Court to the right<br/>I only hope that Clinton will be elected, and that at least the status quo can be maintained.  I am afraid that is the best that can be hoped for given the current temperament of the Republicans in Congress, unless Clinton is elected by a landslide and has large coattails, and we get a Democratically controlled Congress.

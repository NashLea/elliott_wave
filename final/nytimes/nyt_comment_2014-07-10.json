Interest income that accrues in a IRA or 401K is not booked as income at all until it is withdrawn and then it is not booked by the IRS as interest income.  The fraction of income within retirement accounts is much higher for the 99% than for the 1% because of the annual contribution limits (the rich cannot put a large percentage of their assets in these accounts).  Similarly reduced earnings of the assets of defined benefit plans increase the pressure to reduce or eliminate these plans.  3)  The returns for annuities purchased by retirees or near retirees are substantially reduced by the ZIRP.

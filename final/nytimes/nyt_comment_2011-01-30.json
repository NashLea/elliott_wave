While such concerns are real, I think people are focusing too much on the trees.<br /><br />Grammatical errors can be definite turn-offs, but \"professionalism\" is more an attitude than anything. I had the unfortunate upbringing of being raised by truly self-consumed parents, in addition to growing up as an expat in a foreign land, being transported to a bum-hick town of 7000 amidst debilitated family dynamics based on severe mental illnesses (yes, plural). To summarize my person as a 19-year-old emerging from such an environment, I was constantly late to any gathering, never held my opinion back on any subject, had a 5th-grade writing level, and could not understand a lick of English in any professional context.<br /><br />What did matter, though, was my willingness to learn and ask questions. I stand now on the shoulders of many, many people kind and patient enough to support me. And what mattered most is that these mentors acknowledged what success I accomplished while also clearly demonstrating their expectancy of said behaviors.<br /><br />The empowerment factor is crucial, having someone pulling your arm saying, \"Hey, what was THAT right there? Do you think (BLANK) is proper here?\" followed by the crucial \"YOU are BETTER than this\". By expecting more, not adherence to an arbitrary standard, you will be a life-changer in the truest sense, bolstering their potential to transform their careers.<br /><br />Moving along, while \"Tips\" are helpful, they often give off the whiff of an hierarchical, dictatorial environment, of non-entities lording over them. Such rules in themselves become an enemy, effectively denying the worker's worth as a person. Many of you can \"say\" that such misbehavior doesn't correlate with intelligence, and while hitting the nail on the head, these individuals are given such an impression, since they obviously aren't professional -- and thus employable -- material. Thus, the thrashes of the poor against any degree of success (even against the middle-class) is a very logical outcome of never having a true enemy. (And certainly, this can account for much political disfranchisement as well, if the conversation were to go in such a direction).<br /><br />Ex) Give this line your favorite sneaky chain-gang accent:  \"Psst kid, to survive in this dump, you gotta do what I do\".<br /><br />Too often people \"tell\" others how to behave, but they don't go beyond that. Of course you don't -- that's not your job! But if you want to 'think of the children', have a conversation. You can't save everyone, and more often than not you'll be disappointed by the outcome, there will be those that thrive Because of you.<br /><br />Finally, to those who advocate firing inappropriate personnel, I can sympathize and suggest such measures if warranted. But the whole 'who am I to say' is really negated by 'I know, and you apparently don't, so where do we want to go from here.\"<br /><br />Who cares if they get upset!?

Aspies have difficulty acquiring these social skills for a different reason: neurologically based limitations in understanding the social world around them.<br /><br />Therefore, like these disadvantaged youths, Aspies need to be specifically TAUGHT social skills that others acquire naturally. Just as disadvantaged young people may feel as though they have to act as if \u201con stage\u201d when working in a standard American office, so do most Aspies. To Aspies, the larger social world is an alien culture whose customs are difficult to understand and even more difficult to navigate. Having to put on a mask when at work, feeling as if one is constantly on stage, makes working at standard jobs extremely difficult and stressful for most Aspies, as I imagine it does for disadvantaged people. (For a discussion of daily social interaction as playing a role on stage, see Erving Goffman\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.\u201d)<br /><br />Due in large part to deficits in social skills, approximately 85% of people with Asperger\u2019s are underemployed or unemployed, even in times of economic prosperity. The irony is that many Aspies are unusually talented in technology and other fields requiring precise, logical thought. Aspies tend to work harder and produce higher quality work than the average employee. But this is to no avail in a work culture that emphasizes social competence above all else.<br /><br />I\u2019m sure the same is true of many disadvantaged youths \u2013 they have the smarts but don\u2019t have the social polish required to succeed in the American workplace.<br /><br />To play devil\u2019s advocate here \u2014 why should people who don\u2019t fit the standard mold have to twist themselves into pretzels to be accepted in the workplace? I believe the American workplace has a very limited view of acceptable behavior and therefore loses a lot of talented people. To be clear, I think that politeness and civility are critical.

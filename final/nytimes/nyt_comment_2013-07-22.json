Additionally, the Republicans have a lock on a number of lower population states and they want to keep it. Yet, aside from farm subsidies, I have never seen a careful analysis of the effect of the deliberately undemocratic US Senate on giving out federal funds. It is generally true, however, that the heavily populated states, which tend toward the Democrats, send out more of their tax dollars to the smaller states than they get back, while, in turn, those states favor Republicans.<br/><br/>This whole thing resembles a secret deal whereby peace, but not justice or fairness, is kept within the lower 48 states. Competing interests are melded into one, somewhat happy exchange. Yet, with the Republicans on the warpath, threatening to destroy America's \"full faith and credit\" for debt obligations, maybe it is time to re-examine this huge trade off of conflicting interests. It has allowed those who oppose everything the populous states need to get more in federal programs than their paid taxes. Perhaps it is time for change. <br/><br/>City and other officials in Texas were recently denouncing the \"failure\" of the federal govt. to cover the full cost impact of the explosion in West, Texas.

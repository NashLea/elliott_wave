Thus, all the innovation you heap upon the Apple, came from engineers and applied software scientists that migrated, naturally, from the likes of Palo Alto, to the likes of Cupertino.<br /><br />For all those who would like to speak of the great innovation of the iPhone, take a moment, to pause and revisit history. As the first company to combine, a color touch-screen, WiFi antenna, Bluetooth antenna, GSM antenna, a true web browser, MP3 player, ability to install third party apps, replaceable battery, memory expansion via SD cards, and more packaging innovations, that do not quickly come to mind, into the PDA platform, it was HP, in its HP6315, in 2004.<br /><br />So for all you Apple deity followers, know that the great one, as you would have it, was in fact itself, a johnny-come-lately, adapter of an already did-that done-that innovation and technology set.<br /><br />Beyond what the HP6315 had accomplished, some packaging which is the benefit of time to do so, and software adaptations, that its engineers most surely did not invent, what has the iPhone, and thus Apple bought us. Nada; oops my bad, thats right, Apple gave us very good, hyped marketing.<br /><br />As one, who while working at a small mom and pop computer store, saw the first of the Lisa's come through the door, unpacked it on the spot, set it up, attached a third party printer, intuitively, not ever having seen it before, caused its word processor app, that sat on the desktop, to be invoked, then create a simple document, and print it out, I'd say, it was new.<br /><br />But just new to me, a then tech-savvy salesperson and computer geek. How innovative would it have been to the engineers in XEROX's PARC research labs? I'd contend, probably not at all; more like an unscrupulous adaptation.<br /><br />And as one who owns a working MessagePad 110, I would contend, that it was Apple's greatest true innovative moment; one that they dropped, and allowed Palm and thus Compaq to run with.<br /><br />And only after those two entities created the PDA market, and HP embodied the PDA and cellular telephone with the HP6315, did Apple then have the basis for the iPhone.<br /><br />I will at some point, probably with the incorporation of 4G, and some of the obvious left out features, obtain an iPhone. And for what, as many of the Apple worshipers, who would have me as an Apple-hater, would ask? As an end test platform for app development. Yes I am cognizant of the following, and thus need to develop across the platforms, of which the iPhone is one.<br /><br />And oh yeah, please one of the truly knowledgeable ones, please tell me, what truly important app, can I not get for an Android, that is exclusive to just the iPhone. Oh I can answer that, for you, and again it is nada.<br /><br />Oh yeah, here's the question...sorry about the diversions of remembrance...but what in the end, besides a cult like following, will have been the iPads innovation, beyond what has already been available. Again, I will contend, it is nada.<br /><br />So, if I did need a watered down tablet computer, I personally would skip the iPad, with all of its shortcomings, and would wait for the likes of the HP Slate.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the Slate is an HP wanna-be...right!?!<br /><br />He-He-He", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1326153, "replies": [], "lft": 470, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/live-blogging-the-ipads-big-day/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1798499, "rgt": 471, "userDisplayName": "LEM", "createDate": "1270326678", "userID": 1746693, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270356549", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Portland OR", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270352949", "commentSequence": 205, "commentBody": "Don't pick on the NY Times for interesting front page news (ie iPad)<br /><br />Other on line papers I just noted with front page iPad articles:<br /><br />WSJ<br />Washington Post<br />LA Times<br />Portland Oregonion<br />USA Today<br />And on and on.<br />", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1326153, "replies": [], "lft": 472, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/live-blogging-the-ipads-big-day/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1798500, "rgt": 473, "userDisplayName": "TRees", "createDate": "1270326778", "userID": 55482668, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270356827", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Rochester, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270353227", "commentSequence": 206, "commentBody": "How do I connect my rotary desk phone to the iPad?", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1325524, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/what-were-reading-sorry-a-little-more-ipad/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1798507, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "Virilene Manly", "createDate": "1270327048", "userID": 59766205, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270356838", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Manhattan-Safely Uptown", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270353238", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "\"Sour grapes make rancid whine.\"<br /><br />And one bad Apple spoils the bunch.

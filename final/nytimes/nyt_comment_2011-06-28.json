I love it when puzzles play to my strength. And Deb, the Avogadro's number in the clue is not a multiplication per se. It is scientific notation for a very large number - several significant digits together with a multiplier of a power of ten. The earth is 93 x 10^6 (93 million) miles from the sun, etc. 18 grams of water contain an Avogadro's number of molecules, almost a trillion trillion! This is a little over half a tablespoon. If you were to try and count the molecules one at a time and one per second, it would take you 190 trillion years! Or divide up the problem and let each of the earth's 6 billion people help you count and it would take the whole human race 30,000 years to count the molecules in half a tablespoon of water.<br/><br/>Rather than be afraid of numbers it is better to be in awe of them.", "recommendationCount": 10}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

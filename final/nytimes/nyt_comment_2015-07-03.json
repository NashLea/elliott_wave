This story caught my eye because it combines two things I really enjoy: cars and technology. This article, written by Eric A. Taub, talks about using Smartphone apps to control car functions. This man, Sean O\u2019Gorman, uses his Smartphone to do things such as control the interior temperature of his Tesla before getting in so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with waiting for his car to cool down in the hot summer heat. How convenient! Car companies such as Tesla and General Motors are trying to expand on Smartphone and vehicle interactions but there are several obstacles. After considering this, I thought of some problems that could be possible such as your phone battery dying and not having a way to get in or start your car. It amazes me how much you can do with your car nowadays. Before reading this article I admired Chevrolet\u2019s idea of having Wi-Fi in a car. I thought it was genius and really innovative.

The English team was frantic in the last minute and I was astonished at their end at the World Cup. Even though I wasn't rooting for any particular team, I found the own goal heart wrenching. The match had been very equal and entertaining, and I was looking forward to more time or penalty kicks. Something that I found interesting in the article was Claire Cohen's contrasting perspective on the situation. She claims that our sorrow for Bassett is sexist because if a man were to do the same thing, England supporters would be extremely dissapointed by the loss.

She has that voice that they remember, that personality that everyone adores, and those looks that draws everyone in. She signed with the music industry at the age of 14 and ever since then she\u2019s grown into one of the world\u2019s most popular singers. With the launch of the new apple music, Taylor Swift publicly announced her thoughts on this new software. She believes that this update is not helpful to artists themselves and that it is only hurting the company. Like her, I believe that it will result in a major decrease in revenue from Apple. It offers no benefits to the artists themselves which ultimately is who the music industry is trying to please. Apple has retreated and has fit her commands about the royalties but they are still launching their streaming service. Over the years, I have watched Taylor Swift grow as an artist. I have seen her music style change from country to pop. I have seen her personality undergo an enormous transformation. During her early days as a singer, I do not think she would have ever opened her mouth in order to complain about the acts of a major worldwide company. Seeing one young girl stand up to an entire company over the course of a few days, to me, is truly incredible. It demonstrates the power that Taylor Swift has acquired over the course of her career and the love that she shares for her own music.

I couldn\u2019t comprehend why people weren\u2019t ever allowed to marry who they loved just because the law said they can\u2019t. Even though this is certainly a huge step, it doesn\u2019t mean that negative feelings towards the LGBTQ community have even come close to ending. Many members of the community, including myself, weren\u2019t able to celebrate the ruling as openly as they wanted. For me, it might\u2019ve just been in my household, but for others it was just in general. No matter what, I\u2019m still so filled with pride (no pun intended) after this. Especially seeing such a surprisingly large amount of positivity from social media; #lovewins! I myself am still shocked at how many people I know that have not said anything either for, or against the LGBTQ community before that came out to support us through this.. both showing their pride &amp; defending the community if they saw the need to.

The video goes on to explain that these special rats are in fact almost entirely blind, but they do have a very keen sense of smell, which is why they are being trained to find bombs. For humans, locating landmines in the ground is a time-consuming process that involves cutting down plants. Rats can simply investigate an area just by their nose, without having to tear apart the environment, and they can do it significantly faster than a human can. The greatest part about this story is that the rats are too light to set off a bomb that could potentially be underground. It is refreshing to hear that these animals are saving human lives without putting their own lives in danger. What these rats are capable of is beyond amazing as they have opened up farming land that used to be dangerous to people, and have saved many from dying from an explosive.

It shows that this did not just offend the Mexican people, but all who are against racial stereotyping. I also don't understand how Donald Trump can say \"he has great respect for Mexicans\", after accusing them of bringing \"drugs and rapists\" into our country. As for the presidential election, I believe this to a major setback for Trump. Because no matter how much money he has to support his campaign, his support will indeed falter because of what he said about some of the most hardworking people of our country.

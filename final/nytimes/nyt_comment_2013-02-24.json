During the meeting Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious landings were although he had never planned or taken part in one and then referred to Smith as Son although he was only 10 months older than he was. Smith and the Marine command also felt Almond was overly aggressive and were sure that there were large numbers of Chinese Forces in North Korea when higher headquarters in Tokyo was telling them it was not the case. Although ordered to go north to the Yalu River as fast as he could, Smith continuously slowed the division's march to the point of near insubordination. Also along the way he established supply points and an airfield.<br/><br/>In November 1950, with the 1st Marine Division surrounded at the Chosin Reservoir, he directed the breakout and subsequent 70 miles (110 km) march to the seaport of Hungnam.

Gun violence in poor neighborhoods begets gun ownership/protection in better off neighborhoods. While an ex-Marine isn't the best example, as I'm sure nearly all ex-Marines maintain weapons, the notion that a gun owner in a suburb near a dangerous neighborhood isn't somehow connected to that dangerous neighborhood through their ownership of weaponry is not very well thought out. I won't speak about Mr. Keller as I don't know him personally and of course Mr. Pellegrin should have asked him why he owns the weapons he does. But i can say with certainty that a decent percentage of suburban gun owners maintain the ownership for personal protection and that usually isn't for protection from their middle or upper class neighbors. Bravo to Gonzalez and Estrin for the thoroughly researched article. I would like to know Mr. Keller's thoughts on gun ownership in the suburbs and whether he believes this does or does not have any relation to gun violence in the city. Or are gun owners in the suburbs all just out there shooting at the range and/or squirrels for dinner?

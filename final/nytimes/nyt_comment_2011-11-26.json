As I have posted many times before there is a difference between politics and legislating, and the race for the nomination is politics at its heart.  The art of politics is torturing the facts to appeal to a group of supporters and gain enough votes to win an election.  This is the motivation behind Mr. Gingrich\u2019s stated policy on immigration.<br/><br/>The difference between a manager and a leader is the former does things right and the latter does the right thing.  Political leadership is the art of getting support for the right thing, and does not of necessity mean one needs to torture facts to make a point.  It is the identification of policy for the greater good that resonates with and attracts rational voters; it is identification with policy that does not need to be spun to make it appealing.<br/><br/>The irrational base plied with fears of the other the conservative movement has cultivated for so long will not like to hear this appeal to rational policy.  The irrational base will come out to vote because they will vote against President Obama regardless of who the conservatives nominate.  It will be interesting to see how Mr. Gingrich\u2019s immigration policy pronouncement, which is quite similar to the Obama administration\u2019s implemented policy on Latinos, will play out in the battle for the hearts and minds of conservatives.  My guess is one sane policy pronouncement will not make Mr. Gingrich\u2019s nomination because he will eventually walk it back like the rest of his flirtations with rational policy.  His audience will not stand for a policy that is the same as Mr. Obama\u2019s.

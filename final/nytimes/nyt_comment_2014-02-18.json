But, I wish they would broaden their research to include using these games to reproduce the beneficial \"brain states\" produced by meditation, positive imagery, and optimistic attitudes.   Even the feeling of being loved has a beneficial effect on healing.   Wouldn't it be great if computers could help us boost our immune system or speed up bone healing?  There are possibilities here and I hope the researchers realize these possibilities.  Please don't just rely on neuro imaging to measure responses and measure success.  There are other ways to measure physical responses to these games and they might give a hint on the possibilities for the future.  Wouldn't it be cool to be able to \"play\" a game to stimulate certain internal chemical and neuronal responses and cure your respiratory infection?  Might we be looking at the research that will someday lead to a cure for the common cold?  I wanted to research this topic when I was a graduate student at UW Madison back in the 80s, but couldn't find a major professor who would take me (and my wild ideas) on.

Valencia homered to center on a 0-0 count, A.Jones scored, Markakis scored. Hardy doubled to left. Wieters struck out. \"<br/>Robertson got three outs, one of which recorded with Soriano jumping over the fence to bring back Manny Machado's long fly, and gave up four hits. So Robertson's ERA for the appearance was 27.00, his WHIP was 4.00, the opposing batting average against for the inning was .571, the opponent's slugging percentage was 1.143, and the opponent's OPS for the inning was 1.714.

Since Robertson blew a three run lead, none of the other pitchers are, under ANY circumstances, eligible for the win. Face it, this would not be an issue if the Orioles hadn't lit up the usually effective Robertson like a Roman Candle. Not only did he give up a three run home run after getting the first two batters out, but one of those batters, Manny Machado, had to be robbed of a home run by Alfonso Soriano jumping over the fence to catch his long, long fly ball. Had that gone over the fence, then the run that the Yankee$ scored in the top of the ninth merely would have tied the game, instead of putting the Yankee$ ahead, it would have tied the game, putting a save out of reach anyway. From two outs and nobody on with a three run lead to a tied game in four batters? Pretty brief and ineffective. And Johnson will blow enough games between now and season's end to not threaten Mo's Rolaids Award. These kind of scoring decisions, while not frequent, are a regular event for scorers to deal with.

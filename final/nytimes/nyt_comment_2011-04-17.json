Here is Michel T. Klare speaking both for himself and Bill McKibben:<br/>\n\"As the planet warms and glaciers melt, sea levels will rise, inundating coastal areas, destroying cities, and flooding low-lying croplands.  Drought will become endemic in many once-productive farming areas, reducing food supplies for hundreds of millions of people. Many plant and animal species that are key to human livelihoods, including various species of trees, food crops, and fish, will prove incapable of adjusting to these climate changes and so cease to exist.\u201c<br/>\n\u201cBill McKibben is right: we no longer live on the \u2019cozy, taken-for-granted\u2019 planet formerly known as Earth.  We inhabit a new place, already changed dramatically by the intervention of humankind.  But we are not acting upon a passive, impotent entity unable to defend itself against human transgression.  Sad to say, we will learn to our dismay of the immense powers available to Eaarth, the Avenger.\u201c<br/>\nFirst, his description of the the supposed consequences of global warming is completely wrong. There is no global warming now, either anthropogenic or not, because global temperatures are not going up. This you can find out simply by looking at satellite global temperature records, available to everyone on the Web for the last 31 years. During this entire period there was only one short warming incident that raised global temperature by a third of a degree in four years and then stopped (Read \"What Warming?\" pages 31-36). But McKibben is worse with his vision of a planet destroyed by that same global warming. I simply cannot understand the lack of both scientific expertise and intelligence that can put such drivel out  and claim that iot is backed up by a \"consensus\" of 2500 climate \"scientists.\" These people have not the slightest idea how to evaluate scientific observations of nature and how to check out hypotheses against observed facts. Observed fact: Satellite measurements of lower tropospheric air temperature do not show any warming trend before 1998. This same period appears as a \"late twentieth century warming\" in NASA, NOAA, and Met Office temperature curves. Observed fact: satellite temperatures during this period oscillate around a fixed mean for twenty years. Observed fact: the oscillations trace out five El Nino peaks during this period. Observed fact: the valleys between the peaks correlate with La Nina periods. Observed fact: when you compare the satellite curve with either NASA or Met Office curve these same oscillations are present. The first four of the Met Office curve even have the same height as the peaks in the satellite curve. Observed fact: the valleys between the peaks have all been made shallow, and thanks to this device both curves have an upward slope that is claimed to mean warming. Question: is it possible that these curves are wrong because they have reduced the valley depth by a factor ofvtwo or are the satellites wrong by making the valleys twice as deep as they should be. I have not mentioned NOAA's temperature curve yet but it turns out that they have gotten rid of the valleys entirely and their curve just follows the peaks in the beginning. Why even keep the valleys if they don't contribute to warming seems to be their motto. This puts their curve in the category of not just reducing but eliminating the La Nina valleys that exist in the temperature record. And this variety of ways of achieving a rising temperature curve tells us that these rising curves are all human-made or anthropogenic fakes. And when it comes to the twenty-first century temperature, satellites show a warm platform from 2002 to 2008 but no warming. And this in turn gives way to the 2008 La Nina cooling which re-initiates the ENSO oscillations interrupted by the super El Nino. This also means no warming in our future except for the periodic El Nino peaks that ENSO will send our way. But the esteemed keepers of global temperature do not see it this way - their curves already have an imaginary warming in 2011. NASA carries this charade so far as to claim that 2005 was warmer than the 1998 super El Nino which is absurd. And they all tell us that dangerous global warming is still ahead, guaranteed because ever-increasing carbon dioxide and its greenhouse effect. But there is a problem with this fantasy: The infrared absorption band of the atmosphere is already saturated and no further addition of CO2 can increase the already-existing greenhouse warming. I am not making this up but am relying on actual measurements made by weather balloons. Ferenc Miskolczy used the NOAA database of weather balloon observations that goes back to 1948 and determined that the transparency of the atmosphere in the infrared band where carbon dioxide absorbs had not changed for the last 61 years. This means that the greenhouse absorption signature of this added carbon dioxide simply isn't there.

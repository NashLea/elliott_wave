Prior to the electronic age, many of the Protestant churches had this information in the bulletin and to this day many Protestant church attendees will bring a notebook &amp; pen to take notes with. <br/><br/>A study done at the University of Texas found that people remember (Metcalf 1997):<br/><br/>10 percent of what they read;<br/>20 percent of what they hear;<br/>30 percent of what they see;<br/>50 percent of what they see and hear;<br/>70 percent of what they say; and<br/>90 percent of what they do and say <br/><br/>While texting wasn't as popular in 1997 when the study was done, I think it's safe to assume it'd be somewhere in the 50-70% range from that chart.

Long run, this is desirable as we've probably reached peak oil production and need to tap other, cleaner sources of energy.<br/><br/>As well, the price of oil is influenced by favorable tax policies for the oil industry.  Eliminate that, and oil is somewhat less favored.<br/><br/>With respect to U.S. demand for oil, this can be shaved by increasing fuel efficiency standards for transportation.  While oil is used far less frequently to heat plants and buildings, oil demand in these sectors can readily be cut by retrofitting buildings and equipment. <br/><br/>One area in which we agree is that Keystone is a tough call.  If the U.S. is going to import oil, better that we import it from Canada-- especially if the Canadian product is price competitive and provided that the pipeline is routed to minimize environmental concerns.  But long run, oil is a diminishing resource whose environmental costs are prohibitive.  <br/><br/>Bottom line:  Far better to wean ourselves off oil sooner rather than later.

He described unconscious mental structures of intelligence evident in all groups of people he had studied. He concluded that modern thinking cannot have achieved any qualitative progress over primitive thinking. A difference exists only to the extent that the thinking of primitives is untamed and that of modern, urban cultures is domesticated. L\u00e9vy-Strauss\u2019s proof strikes even more sharply at moderns\u2019 belief in ethnocentricity. His research showed that despite their so-called backwardness primitives rather than moderns possessed a marked advantage: they remained in a very close relationship with the totality of their world while modern man had become an alienated component of his. He also concluded that many modern ethnographers and philosophers harbor a deep misconception about primitive peoples: that the advantage of the primitive would be more than counterbalanced by an advantage possessed by modern man, namely that he is master of independent reason while the primitive is subject to the dominance of affects. He showed that although many of his contemporaries claimed they had explained the inferiority of primitives concerning rationality his studies refuted this ethnocentric concept. His work showed that while primitives think in a different way than we do they are no less rational.", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

When push comes to shove, it will be us against them, we will again deny people their rights based on nothing more than race or religion.<br /><br />Not even 100 years ago, we denied Americans their civil rights.

It is a war on all fronts.<br /><br />This is why we demand that all Moslem people, whether they had anything to do with this attack against us, keep apologizing to us, and keep apologizing to us for what 500, maybe 5000 moslem men did.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of our words can actually convince people.

Having read his op-ed piece on the WTC mosque/center carefully several times, I just realized why I don\u2019t classify myself as a party line \u201cLiberal\u201d or Republican.   And here\u2019s why:<br /><br />Many independent and open-minded people of all stripes, not just Republicans, at least question the timing and wisdom of developing an Islamic center/mosque near the WTC.  Furthermore, I know hardly anything about the background of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf and the development organization.  Therefore I refuse to take Kristof's word alone on this, and neither should he. He's not addressed this issue sufficiently. That's why we vet the individual and organization(s) involved in this development, especially after the greatest atrocities since Pearl Harbor were committed here and around the world by Islamic terrorists, including Al Qaeda.  That's why we have a CIA, FBI, etc. -- and we have learned that they leave much to be desired as Texas visibly demonstrated.<br /><br />Is Kristof saying that no terrorist cells exist in NYC, especially after two bombings of the WTC?  Maybe he needs to focus more attention stateside.<br /><br />Mr. Kristof even concedes that \"Sure, the Islamic world is disproportionately turbulent, and mullahs sometimes cite the Koran to incite murder.\"  Is not the bombing of the WTC and subsequent connected loss of life, blood and treasure -- American and others -- here and in Iraq/Afghanistan/Pakistan enough to warrant a thorough investigation without stopping the development process?  Should this not have already been done? Where does Mr. Kristof stand here?<br /><br />And how does one separate religion from culture, be it Muslim, Christian, Judaism, Atheism or other?  And how many \"cultures\" are part of this organization and project?  How is it being financed?<br /><br />And why has Mr. Kristof remained silent on the statements of President Obama, Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Pelosi?<br /><br />I remain unconvinced that moving forward without adequate safeguards is wise until or unless we do our homework -- and do it well.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1773578, "replies": [], "lft": 580, "assetURL": "http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/when-republicans-and-jihadis-agree/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2433726, "rgt": 581, "userDisplayName": "MEB-NYC", "createDate": "1282529347", "userID": 57747634, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282539270", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282535670", "commentSequence": 282, "commentBody": "Yes and What about Howard Dean and Harry Reid and 66% of the the American public", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1773578, "replies": [], "lft": 582, "assetURL": "http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/when-republicans-and-jihadis-agree/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2433727, "rgt": 583, "userDisplayName": "Hari", "createDate": "1282529362", "userID": 22425767, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282539270", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282535670", "commentSequence": 283, "commentBody": "Nicholas: I love your columns. You repeatedly put your (and your family's) life where your opinions are and for that reason alone, your views count with me. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with your logic on the reasons to build the Ground Zero mosque.<br /><br />Because Bin Laden and co are rooting against the Ground Zero mosque being built, it doesn't mean that building the mosque is a good idea. We have already been fooled by this line of reasoning (\"spiting you enemy is a good thing\") many times over. (We thought) Bil Laden loved Saddam, so we took Saddam out - for what purpose? Now, we believe Bin Laden wants to undermine the Pakistani government, so we support that feckless group and their chameleon armed forces with no expectation of performance or reciprocity. These are tactically brilliant moves and colossal strategic blunders.<br /><br />Your other arguments are more cogent and relevant - I agree that the Ground Zero Imam is probably a good man; I agree that every religion has been used by unscrupulous politicians for sectarian purposes and so it is wrong to blame the \"moderate\" observers of that religion. But these arguments do NOT support your conclusion - that building the Ground Zero mosque will resonate as a statement about US support for Islam. What it will resonate as is an abdication by American citizens of their personal responsibility in rejecting violent political Islam - the kind that destroyed the Twin Towers, NO the kind that the Imam represents. If you find my argument hard to follow think of it his way: by your line of reasoning, the Jews who were being burned by the Christians should have agreed to a church in Jerusalem, in honor of the \"good\" Christians who were NOT the ones that actually burnt the Jews.<br /><br />I agree that national Republican leaders have not helped by politicizing this issue; but I then expect you to also criticize the President for wading into this issue. Quite honestly, both sides are being pathetic in the way they are using 9/11 for their own political ends.<br /><br />In the end, I make my decision based on two sets of people: one set is the families of the 9/11 victims, many of whom have said they oppose this mosque and the other, the Imam and his wife and their noble intentions. And in this contest, the question is: if the Twin Towers were NOT destroyed, would anyone have a problem with this mosque being built? The answer is NO. So by building this mosque, we are in effect signing off that we have accepted the Twin Towers bombing as a fait accompli in our psyche and that the victims and their families are no longer part of the equation. I refuse to do that.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

I give him props for pushing investments in education, infrastructure, etc. that will grow the economy and keep the US competitive. But his ideas on the other side of the ledger, ie getting spending and deficit under control were a complete cop out. Any realistic and honest approach to fiscal discipline has to tackle entitlements--Social Security and Medicare. Establishing the umpteenth commission to study Social Security reform is pathetic when we already know what the options are: raise payroll taxes, raise the retirement age, and cut or means-test benefits. Same on Medicare--we need some combination/subset  of raising eligibility age, trimming and/or means-testing benefits, forcing beneficiaries to pay more and raising payroll taxes. Instead, Obama called for nibbling around the edges by more efficient spending, reducing fraud, etc. That's just not going to get us there and I wish he had the guts to say this. Unfortunately I have to give props to Paul Ryan, who in his response, focused almost exclusively on the debt/spending issue, which has the potential to permanently cripple this country in a way that few of the many issues Obama raised can.<br /><br />Overall, I am hungry for an honest politician to tell me that we all need to sacrifice to right the ship of our country--that means work harder, spend less, pay a bit more in taxes--ALL OF US. I am ready and willing to do this, but Obama's speech left me disappointed again. I hate to say it, but this is forcing me to contemplate supporting the Republicans--if only because they seem more likely to tackle the fiscal sustainability issue more seriously.<br /><br />  ", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2341584, "replies": [], "lft": 32, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/house-orders-budget-trimmed/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3292045, "rgt": 33, "userDisplayName": "jblee", "createDate": "1296017435", "userID": 18851823, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296018144", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new york city", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296018144", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "John Boehner and his cohorts misread the results of the last election.

I know someone that used the webcast recently for her husband's funeral, and people from all over, folks that were sick or elderly, could feel a part of the love and also the grief and support the family.  It's a different day and age, and although it should not replace going to the funeral if you can, it is overall a good thing.  Being judgmental of those that have used the online funeral web cast is also, quite rude.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2338376, "replies": [], "lft": 218, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/fashion/25death.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3291522, "rgt": 219, "userDisplayName": "Korinne", "createDate": "1296007808", "userID": 62687085, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296018329", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Omaha, NE", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296018329", "commentSequence": 103, "commentBody": "Technology has become a wonderful thing but there are some things technology isn't mean to interfere with.

Mark (Colin Farrell) is a war photographer who is severely injured in the fighting and returns home suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. With the help of his wife's grandfather, played flawlessly by 88 year old former horror movie star Christopher Lee, he is able to finally face the shocking events that left the profound shock and guilt that produced his psychological trauma.  The cast is simply superb: every role, from the weary, resigned battlefield doctor who must kill his mortally wounded patients to end their suffering, to the pregnant wife of Mark's friend, who is at the center of Mark's trauma, to Mark's own faithful and loving wife.  It is a heart-wrenching tale that cannot help but touch and move all but the most cynical among us, arousing our sorrow and compassion for the victims of war, and anger at its brutality and its awful consequences.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2338376, "replies": [], "lft": 220, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/fashion/25death.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3291850, "rgt": 221, "userDisplayName": "Maria", "createDate": "1296014217", "userID": 15071555, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296018336", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296018336", "commentSequence": 104, "commentBody": "Dehumanization at its best.

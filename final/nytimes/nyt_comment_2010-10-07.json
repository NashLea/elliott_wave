One recent study showed lower brain tissue density in areas that control memory, executive function, autonomic control, and breathing. CT studies show a much higher rate of lacunar infarcts in people with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Others show diminished brain function and metabolism in many critical parts of the brain. A rat study showed that chronic hypoxia leads to beta amyloid plaque buildup in the brain. Numerous studies show that sleep apnea patients have increased levels of inflammatory markers, including CRP, IL2, IL6, TNF, just to name a few. Blood is markedly thicker in sleep apnea\u2014as a results, blood can stagnate in small vessels, leading to microscopic strokes. Areas in the brainstem that control hearing is particularly susceptible to this thickening and clotting.<br /><br />Imagine if you clotted off a small vessel that goes to an area that controls breathing. Perhaps this can lead to central sleep apnea. Since obstructive sleep apnea is strongly linked to heart disease, it's no surprise that central sleep apnea is linked to heart disease.<br /><br />Obstructive sleep apnea is due to skeletal anatomic narrowing, so it's there long before you develop symptoms. It's also important to note that you don't have to be overweight, male, snore, or have a thick neck to have significant obstructive sleep apnea. Many patients in my practice with sleep apnea are young, thin women that don't snore.<br /><br />Most modern humans have smaller jaws due to dental crowding. This is thought to be due to a radical change in our diets and possibly aggravated by bottle feeding. The smaller your jaws, the less space there is for your tongue, and when on your back, the tongue falls back (due to gravity) and collapses when you're in deep sleep (due to muscle relaxation). This is why many people with obstructive sleep apnea can't or prefer not to sleep on their backs.<br /><br />Sleep apnea such a common problem, even in young people, that if you have early dementia, it just makes sense to screen for obstructive sleep apnea. It's surprising that Alzheimer's researchers and sleep apnea researchers aren't talking to each other. Hypoxia and brain tissue injury is a likely reason for amyloid plaque buildup.<br /><br />CPAP is the generally recommended first line option, but oral appliances can be used as well for snoring and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Surgery can also be effective, but only when all the areas of obstruction  (nose, palate and tongue) are addressed properly.<br /><br />It's estimated that 90% of people with obstructive sleep apnea are not diagnosed. Think about all the car accidents and industrial accidents that happen as a result of untreated obstructive sleep apnea. It's also associated with significantly increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.

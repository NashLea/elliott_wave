First, federal supports to the states have been slashed because of Bush 43's Great Recession, resulting in not only increased unemployment for teachers, policemen and firefighters, since states cannot, politically, step up to make the difference.  The easiest scapegoat in every state has been support for public universities--once state supported, then state assisted, then state existing, and now state inhibited.<br/><br/>Did you know that it is illegal to mingle instructional and research funding sources, on every campus?  Or did you think that federal research funds could be used for classroom instruction?<br/><br/>Budgets everywhere have been cut, first across the board, then by eliminating programs.  U. Florida just eliminated computer science, in spite of an increasing demand for graduates, after FL cut their budget by 30% over the last 6 years.  The only recourse left is to raise tuition as carefully as possible, while seeking private support for scholarships, etc., to mitigate that.<br/><br/>Two flagship public universities with which I am familiar have their state operating budgets now down to about 10%, and their total budgets below 5%, from state sources.

In fact there is a Sharia Board that is a nationwide committee of Maulvis (Muslim Scholars, which is again an elected body) who make the decision about what is acceptable for Muslims throughout India.

They are not a monolith as it is commonly perceived. <br/><br/>Also, to understand the reason India grants its Muslim population Sharia type of \"freedom\", you have to delve into its history, which cant be done here. But you have to start from the formation of Muslim league of India in the first half of 20th Century when they started demanding a separate state called Pakistan. Therefore to assure Muslim's religious freedom in will be respected in the newly free India several concession were made and Sharia was one of them. However, with 65 years of democracy its about time that Muslims in India demand more from their country in terms of civil liberties.

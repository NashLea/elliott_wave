Age 0.01 is potentially too old to make this choice (assuming parents could make binding decisions for their off-spring).

There would, of course, still be quite a lot of risk that couldn't be predicted at that age, but many people would definitely know whether they were at elevated risk or particularly low risk.<br/><br/>It's an empirical question to what extent people would use that knowledge to risk-sort.

The die was cast for this franchise when Wilpon somehow maneuvered to force majority owner Doubleday (a descendant of Abner Doubleday, purportedly the inventor of the game) to sell to Wilpon against his will. Think it was a curse for the Red Sox to sell Babe Ruth to fund a Broadway play? How about forcing out a descendant of a Civil War hero-general who might have invented the game? Bernie Madoff was just icing on the cake. If you eliminate the non contributors being paid by the Mets this season, Johan Santana, Jason Bay and Frank Francisco, the payroll is among the lowest in MLB. If the finances are so parlous as to necessitate that level of penny pinching, then the owners simply *must* sell. They play in a beautiful, expensively built palace built with at least the backing of NY taxpayers in the form of tax-free municipal equivalent bonding ($800M worth). And the bottom line is (as is being revealed with the misbegotten garage at Yankee $tadium), in case of default, we taxpayers will prove to be on the hook, and that is in no way acceptable.<br/>Why Jay feels we should be kind to the owners is a mystery to me.

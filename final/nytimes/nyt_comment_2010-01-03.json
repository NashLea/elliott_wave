I frequent 5 star hotels for business and I travel with family often finding value. I struck gold. This is BY FAR/HANDS DOWN the best value for your money ANYWHERE I have been in the world. Let me explain:<br /><br />1) I paid 60 euros a night for a double room ($75)<br />2) The location is fantastic as it is only 5 minutes walk to Sultanahmet (Blue Mosque), Hagia Sopia and Topkapi Palace!<br />3) I was traveling with my 9 month old son. The staff went above the call of duty and bought a new cot and a baby bathtub. I told them it wasnt necessary but they still went ahead an got it. No five star hotel has done that (without paying for it)<br />4) Breakfast is superb. Great selection and lots to eat. Hot omelletes as well.<br />5) We also were brought our buffet plates up to the terrace where you have a superb view (unobstructed) of the Blue mosque and the Sea of Marmara. Beautiful.<br />6) Every afternoon were were asked for tea or coffee (complimentary) and were delivered it within 3 minutes each day after ordering with a nice surprise of a plate of cookies/biscotti. Fantastic.<br />8) The hotel is owned by an artichetct and it shoes. It is renovated beautifully and it is well decorated and looks new. The bathrooms are small, but adequate, clean and nice looking.<br />9) Free internet-Free turkish bath(hammam)<br />10) 2way free transfer to airport<br /><br />I am forgetting a lot of things, but I am very satisfied with this stay. I would recommend this place to any everyone.<br /><br />The only one drawback to this hotel is that if you are wishing for a livelier evening and nightlife, you have to head out to the new part of Istanbul to Beyoglu. Sometimes we taxi'd it and sometimes we took the tram. But this isnt the hotel's fault.

Richardson and Jones in the backfield, but to pass protect while Sanchez probes the edges. If the Bengals are forced to send their safeties wide, that will open up the middle, and once the linebackers have to prevent the big pass play, that will leave a more fair fight for the running game.<br /><br />So - edges downfield, then some middle passing, then the running game.<br /><br />We'll see, of course, and it's equally possible that Rex will say \"Stuff it in there\" and go mano-a-mano. I've seen a lot of coaches run the ball and run the ball until they finally manage to move the chains, and only then allow some passing, once they've earned the defense's respect.<br /><br />But wouldn't that also be playing into the Bengals hands? What they want to do - what every Jets opponent wants to do - is make Sanchez have to win or lose the game. So in other words their very game plan is to stop the run and force the Jets to pass.<br /><br />So...beat them to the pass, so to speak.

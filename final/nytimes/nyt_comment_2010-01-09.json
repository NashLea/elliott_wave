After the military I enjoyed shooting \u2018high power rifle\u2019 for awhile, where one engages 10 pt targets out to 600 yards. I would occasionally see someone show up at a shoot with an AK47 / SKS, but they\u2019d almost always quit at the 300 yard line as they couldn\u2019t hit anything.<br /><br />To be effective with something like an M14 one needs a lot more training as the recoil requires tighter positions for semi-auto fire. The training is required as one is forced to carry less of the heavier ammo, so each round needs to count, at least count more. Hits count, not rounds fired, something evident by how a good rifleman / sniper can pin down a larger unit. As others have mentioned we\u2019re talking about what is the best all around compromise for a rifle, and with the M16A1 it was recognized that a heavier round was needed to engage troops at distance. The M16A2 with a heavier, slower bullet was a result, and the heavier barrel could withstand higher rates of sustained fire. It was interesting to see that with the M16A2 we ended up with a rifle that weighed almost as much as M14 and had a round that had a muzzle velocity similar to that used in the M14. The M4 appears to be reaction to the length and weight, and we seemed to end up with something similar to M1 Carbine / M1 Garand differences in firepower, although the differences are a lot less as the same ammo is used in the M16A2 and M4.<br /><br />The M16 needs more care regarding cleaning, cleaning techniques need to vary with temperature and conditions, and magazines and ammo need to be kept clean too.

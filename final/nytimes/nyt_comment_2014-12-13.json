I have friends for example who are faculty.   To work from home when they had a newborn, they hired a nanny so that they could actually work while they were at home.   Even for jobs that provide some time and flexibility, the work still needs to be done, and I can't see how someone could focus on a child and work--even if they were at home.  There would still be a need for child care.   Also, even for the case of an older child, there is still the question of what fraction of jobs can be done working from home.    In some professions (say for example medicine, or say for example administrative support) in person interactions are required.   Even for positions where people could work from home often require a significant amount of overlap with coworkers.   <br/><br/>I think a more sensible policy is some variation of the French solution where some period of paid leave of 6 months (a bit arbitrary) is given to a family when they have a newborn and that there is good public affordable daycare to encourage women to come back to the workforce.

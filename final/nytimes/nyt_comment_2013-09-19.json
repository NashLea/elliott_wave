Imagine: the parrot has memorised some twenty statements that it can squawk out at random.

All are capable of accumulating, transporting and exchanging heat energy.\"  <br/><br/>Finally, two points about the immediate focus of Andy's article, the great Arctic meltdown. One, the late-summmer ice is disappearing, and will be gone soon, though no one knows exactly when. 75% of the pre-1979 ice has already disappeared, and at that rate the rest should be gone around 2025 at the latest. <br/><br/>But more important than whether there are a few cubic kilometers of ice left in 2020 or 2030 is the overall rapid warming of the Arctic region that is raising havoc with the jet stream, melting permafrost and releasing methane, disrupting Arctic Ocean ecosystems and influencing the oceanic conveyor belts.

It is the most transparent financial organization in the world. It publishes its balance sheet every week, on Thursday. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes its purchases of Treasury securities daily and weekly inventory lists of the securities it owns. For example on 9/17 purchases totaled $1.474 billion and included $252 million of cusip number 912810QQ4, 4.375% coupon, 30 year bonds, maturing 5/15/2041. The details of the bids are not released immediately, but when the open market desk bought $56 million of the same bonds on 8/29 they paid a weighted average price of 112.136 and a least favorable accepted price of 112.14062500.  On 9/11 the Fed held $24.378 billion of that bond.    <br/><br/>The weekly balance sheet can be found at:<br/><a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/\" title=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/</a><br/>and the weekly inventory of holdings can be accessed from:<br/><a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html\" title=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html</a><br/><br/>Almost all the money the Fed is spending on these purchases is not going anywhere -- it is staying at the Fed. Since the $85 billion a month purchases were announced a year ago, Fed security holdings, including unamortized premiums net of discounts, increased by $861.6 billion, but deposits of banks at the Fed increased by $772.7 billion, so net about $88.9 billion was injected into the economy. The banks are earning 0.25% on those deposits instead of the 3% or 4% someone was earning on the bonds.

What surprise? The surprise would have been for the FED (or should we call them agents of doom?)to have tapered the blatantly obnoxious rob your riches in day light scheme. Now how do you figure this? The fed spends close to a 100 billion every month..and it may be much more we do not really know... however let's say $85 billion every 4 weeks, as they so solemnly swear, buys bonds from banks and other too big to fail corporations, the only condition is \"do not hire more people, because if I see that I shall stop injecting unconditional 85 billion into your pockets...\" ok as a CEO, I'd put a cap on hiring, i am getting free money. Where is the surprise? Other then the one that some were so stupid to believe there would be one?

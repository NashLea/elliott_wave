Shocked that this could happen!\" Moments after, someone from GE will hand that NRC regulator his gambling winnings from GE's stock on Wall Street.<br/>\n     I've been to NRC hearings and every time the commissioners have bent over backwards as far as the utilities are concerned, but acted downright hostile against anyone challenging the industry. It was this way while trying to question the blockage of spent fuel expansion at the Trojan Nuclear Plant north of Portland in the late 70s. I heard from others at other hearings that it was always this way, with the regulators always hostile to any opposition.<br/>\n     Fukushima challenges this. That the same reactor designs are used here won't help this industry. Its time that the entire industry from top down be audited and shut down, should the risks prove too great.<br/>\n     I have no problem with people gambling and risk taking on Wall Street basically. But gambling with 104 aging nukes that should be put down is another problem. And we've seen from the housing bubble collapse how risk taking doesn't always work out so well. In the Housing Bubble collapse, the result was mostly inconvenient for many, some painfully so, but the fatality rate is pretty low. But if we lost Indian Point to a Category 7 accident and the wind was blowing to Manhattan, 40 miles downwind, then the results would be catastrophic, with the only silver lining being that Wall Street would be uninhabitable for a long time perhaps! The same mindset and the same pool of money that gambled on the Housing Bubble is gambling on these Nukes. The Housing Bubble didn't work out so well.<br/>\n     A risk that I doubt anyone in the government takes seriously is the potential for a terrorist attack. Yet last week 5 were arrested in Great Britain while taking photos of a reprocessing facility. On 9/11, Mohammed Atta flew one of the planes right over Indian Point. I'm sure some terrorists out there are looking at the havoc taking place at Fukushima and pondering these facts, and could be plotting an attack on an aging and vulnerable nuke somewhere, maybe as revenge for last week's event.<br/>\n     What a can of worms this industry has created! And the final rub? If something bad happens, the Utilities and the Industry are off the hook beyond $540 million dollars, thanks to the Price-Anderson Act. Who gets to pay for the disaster? The US Taxpayer. Fukushima's cleanup could cost trillions. Imagine the cost if New York City had to be abandoned, if Indian Point had a severe accident!

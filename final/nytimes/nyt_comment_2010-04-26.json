You could even put hinm in the Joe Haden group as a guy whose lack of great speed was overlooked.

There are, in fact, a couple of distinct alternate strategies that result in the same number of possibilities as the straightforward ordered strategy.<br /><br />One of them is the one you proposed, where the player concentrates on two of the cups and uses, at most, eight guesses to narrow the choices for those two cups down to two remaining colors (having eliminated the same four colors for both of these cups). At this point, the player can be wrong only one more time in solving the question of which color is under each of these first two cups, bringing the total number of errors to nine, which is the same maximum as if he had followed the ordered strategy and been wrong five times on the first cup and four times on the second.<br /><br />A variation on this is if the player uses no more than nine wrong guesses to narrow the choices for the first three cups down to three colors. Using your notation, this means that the first nine guesses are of the form (a,b), where a and b are each limited to three choices, e.g., a = 1, 2 and 3, and b = 1, 2 and 3. The player has now divided the puzzle into two separate 3x3 problems. He knows that the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are all in positions 4 through 6, and therefore, the numbers in the first three positions are all greater than 3 (i.e., 4, 5 or 6). Attacking each of these smaller problems in an ordered way, he can be wrong, at most, three times on each, which, added to the nine potential errors already made, again brings the total to 15.<br /><br />However, I do not agree with the claim that you seem to be making that no matter how the player makes his guesses, he will eventually have enough information to limit the number of reasonable sequences of guesses to 720. This is equivalent to saying that the player cannot possibly make more than 15 errors. I believe that I have already provided examples that show that this is not true. In my worst case example, where the player spreads his guesses across all six possible numbers and all six positions, he can be wrong up to 24 times, without ever making an unreasonable or redundant guess. At that point, he has limited the possibilities for each position to only two numbers (a different pair for each position), and as soon as he knows the correct answer for one of the positions, the rest will fall like dominoes, so he can be wrong only one more time, at worst.<br /><br />I will generalize this and try to demonstrate what I mean using the simpler 4x4 version of the problem in my next post.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1402121, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/united-continental-deal-talks-snag-over-price/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1901739, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "CFXK", "createDate": "1272244861", "userID": 1218516, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1272256056", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "DC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1272252456", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "The only way this might work is if the superior airline (Continental) buys and completely takes over the grossly inferior airline (United), jettisons the United management, permeates the Continental culture throughout the entire new airline and retains the well-respected Continental brand.<br /><br />In spite of all the caricatures of the airline experience, flying on Continental is noticeably different than the experience of flying on the other legacy airlines -- in EVERY aspect.

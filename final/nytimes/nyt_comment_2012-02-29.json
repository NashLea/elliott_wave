However, the First Amendment states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\" meaning \"there shalt be a separation between thy church and thy state.\" <br/><br/>Yet Santorum accuses \u201cour culture, our education system\u2019\u2019 of falsely \u201cteaching our children that separation of church and state\u201d is mentioned in the Constitution.<br/><br/>Either Santorum doesn't understand the First Amendment or he doesn't understand that Amendments to the Constitution are part of the Constitution. He also doesn't seem to realize that some voters take the Constitution seriously - much more seriously, it appears,  than Mr. Santorum.  (Parenthetically, this may be why Mr. Santorum is opposed to higher education - educated people are capable of critical thinking.)

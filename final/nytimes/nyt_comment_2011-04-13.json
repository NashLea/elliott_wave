Several times the output per pound of engine weight vs piston engines - possible.  Several times the output, in an absolute sense - no way.<br/><br/>&gt; To many commentors: the hotter an engine runs, the more efficiently it runs.  This is straightforward thermodynamics.<br/><br/>&gt; Your comments about fuel energy density are some of the more insightful ones you've made, in the past couple of years.  Add to that: 1 - gas is a binary fuel (i.e. it needs something else - oxygen - to burn...i.e. there's safety, if the fuel can be kept from oxygen).  Once a battery starts burning, it's unstoppable, in an energy-sourcing sense.  2 - liquid fuel has an inherent factor of 2X in fuel weight density vs batteries.  i.e. our gas tanks are, on the average, half full.  Batteries weigh their full weight, whether charged or discharged.<br/><br/>&gt; The holy grail here is not an engine of any type - but a fuel cell.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad piece.

These are highly improbable breakthroughs with huge potential impact.<br/><br/>A 24/7 program to validate, develop and produce these practical, cost-competitive, technologies takes little more than well supported entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>No nation on earth has more of them. The missing ingredient has been adequate adventure capital, as Black Swans always find it hard to be taken seriously, until they no longer need liquidity.<br/><br/>For example, look at the history of cold fusion. Dismissed by almost every scientist, it now is emerging as a cost-competitive alternative to all fossil fuels and Uranium. <br/><br/>See Cold Fusion on the same Aesop website to learn more about this remarkable breakthrough than you probably want to know.<br/><br/>Coal, oil, natural gas and Uranium can be cheaply surpassed by green systems that are inherently much safer and in abundant supply. <br/><br/>The time has come to focus on the truly practical alternatives that have been difficult to take seriously. <br/><br/>As the Wright Brothers opened a new era in flight, Andrea Rossi has produced a practical beacon to lead us out of our energy morass.<br/><br/>And the impact on the economy will be hard to beat.

We are about to drill (on and offshore and in deep-water)/frack/mine our way to lower our dependence upon imported oil dramatically.  This will be a large enough effort to move unemployment numbers in a positive direction (although this could be offset by a weakening of the economy).  We are, also, about to get back to manufacturing our own goods with our own energy.  We will continue to pursue this path until we have fully-viable alternatives, this will be decades at least.  While we can all support the replacement of these traditional fuels, to do so irrationally or based upon failed conjecture is a no-go with an economically ravaged world.  When they make sense, they will simply out-compete and will prevail.   <br/><br/>As there remains zero evidence or proof that carbon emissions from any source have affected or will affect climate, any paper or work that assumes this is working from theory or speculation or in focus on The Precautionary Principle.  Perhaps it would be more accurate and responsible then to add to your descriptions words which clarify that the assumptions used in these works or assertions are theoretical, conjectural or speculative.  Not to do so, where there is no evidence to support said assertions and when faced with factors such as an 80 year deceleration of the rate of sea-level rise into the face of 80 years of additional carbon hollers out to anyone watching the science that something is dramatically wrong in the land of 'more carbon=more heat= rising seas' aka the 'settled science' of climate change - isn't correct or the long-term (larger than multi-decadal oscillations such as the period between 1976 and 1999 +/-) sea-level rise would be accelerating and it simply is not.  <br/><br/>\"Working with the complete monthly-averaged records of 57 U.S. tide gauges archived in the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level data base that had lengths of 60-156 years (with a mean time span of 82 years), however, they determined that there had not been any acceleration in the rate-of-rise of the sea level along the shorelines of the United States over that period of time, during which interval the world's climate alarmists claim the planet had warmed at a rate and to a level that were unprecedented over the past one to two millennia. Quite to the contrary, in fact, they detected a slight deceleration of -0.0014 mm/year/year. And working with 25 of the tide gauge records that contained data for the period 1930-2010, they calculated an even larger deceleration of -0.0130 mm/year/year.....also report that they \"obtained similar decelerations using worldwide-gauge records.....they rhetorically ask why the concomitant worldwide-temperature increase \"has not produced acceleration of global sea level over the past 100 years,\" and, indeed, \"why global sea level has possibly decelerated for at least the last 80 years.\"\" [Houston, J.R. and Dean, R.G. 2011: Journal of Coastal Research]\"<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.c3headlines.com/2011/04/scientists-discover-that-actual-sea-levels-are-doing-opposite-of-ipcc-model-predictions.html\" title=\"http://www.c3headlines.com/2011/04/scientists-discover-that-actual-sea-levels-are-doing-opposite-of-ipcc-model-predictions.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.c3headlines.com/2011/04/scientists-discover-that-actual-sea-l...</a><br/><br/>Best Wishes", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2619297, "replies": [], "lft": 52, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/the-wave-of-the-car-engine-future/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3679663, "rgt": 53, "userDisplayName": "edmartinezojeda", "createDate": "1302656713", "userID": 58649920, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302667402", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bucaramanga", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302663802", "commentSequence": 24, "commentBody": "simple, we will have to step a little back to the steam engine, this time started by an efficient electric push, then the warm up and so on.", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Perhaps this is where the next investigation should be focused: how can current equilibrium be changed? Some would argue that minimizing the impact of large-dollar political contributions could have impact; another exogenous shock, like another energy crisis, could change the political calculus. The continuing rise of inequality could also be a catalyst for popular protest. <br/><br/>There is still a great deal of popular discontent out there, but the people who might form a popular opposition are disorganized, and lack a clear sense of how to proceed.

Somewhere in the middle of this great document, a paragraph reads as follows: \"He[referring to King George],has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing  the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither; and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\"<br/> Clearly even than, our Founding Fathers understood that to establish a new nation, equal to the Great Powers, the proses required immigration. Why does the GOP and its followers refuse to see the  wisdom of the Founders so clearly stated in the great document? Perhaps they have not it.

Why don't \"conservatives\" want to preserve the commons, but instead force everything in the world into someone's ownership? As far as I can see, \"conservatives\" use ideology entirely to for one goal, power/wealth/control. They want to be free and unfettered in their desire to tell the rest of us what we can do, own, and think. They resent any infringement on their own power, both as individuals and as a group. No woman, for example, may have control over her own body as long as a conservative believes birth control is wrong. \"Conservatives\" want hegemony because the freedom of others takes away their power, not their freedom. Should the guy in the Romney video who needs medical marijuana to survive be allowed freedom to impinge upon Romney's belief that marijuana is wrong? Nosirree. As usual, the ideas follow the instincts. \"Conservative\" instincts are toward a hierarchical society with a few white men at the top, a highly unequal world where people who don't fit in die, and an entirely humanized and commodified nature that a few white men control.

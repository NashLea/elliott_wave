The reason you don't hear from us often is because it isn't safe to speak the truth about it.  If we, as adults adoptees, express anything but positive feelings, we are chastised as being \"bitter\" on not \"grateful.\" Personally, I have tried to gently share my own story and have been rebuffed.  As an infant, I cried inconsolably for two weeks without my mother coming back.  As a child, I begged to know who my first parents were.  It was like oxygen for me. I NEEDED them and I was treated like an ungrateful brat for wanting anyone but my adoptive parents. I wanted to die.  As a teenager, I cried out through dangerous behaviors (eating disorder, drinking, reckless driving, promiscuity) for someone to recognize the pain inside that had always been there but I couldn't put words to it.  Despite all the ways I cried out, at no time did anyone suggest to me that I was grieving the loss of my first mother.  The notion that my adoptive parents were somehow better and I that I would naturally be grateful to have this \"better\" life was so pervasive, that nobody considered that separating me from my mother would cause trauma.  Now, as a mother and grandmother, I've felt compelled to shed light on what seems like an obvious observation.  Babies want their mothers!  However, I quickly learned that people are not open to hearing anything negative about adoption.  Once again, despite crying out for no one will hear the truth."}]}, "lft": 104, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/adopted-as-a-child-now-a-mother-finally-lucky/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 14152369, "rgt": 125, "userDisplayName": "gette", "createDate": "1424133121", "userID": 47684609, "replyCount": 10, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1424149980", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1424149980", "commentSequence": 14152369, "commentBody": "Not a kind word for the parents who adopted you and cared for you?

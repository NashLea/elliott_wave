The struggle between Democracy which looks to the needs of all and plutocracy which favors the protection of vast wealth is indeed at the root of our political conflicts.<br/><br/>Plutocrats have successfully sold their ideas  to many who are hurt by those very ideas playing on fears of government and loss of individual rights which has been a strong undercurrent throughout our history.  Gail Collins the other day made a strong case for a dichotomy between the viewpoints of the city dweller who sees the need for good government and those in the hinterlands who hang onto feeling s of individuality and resent what they see as unneeded controls.  And these divisions have been very convenient for the plutocrats.<br/><br/>Mr. Pickety on his masterpiece  on capitalism makes the strong case for fair, effective government as a requirement for any social growth.

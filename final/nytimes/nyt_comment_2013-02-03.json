How do you say that healthcare purchases are less valuable than other purchases? Where is the evidence for such a statement? The bottom line in this debate is that the American public really does not understand the true value of healthcare since they don't directly pay for it. Payment for the most part occurs through multiple intermediaries such as the employer and an insurance company, therefore shielding the receiver of the care from the real costs.

Providers will actually have to compete with each other on quality and value. No politician has the courage to propose this.

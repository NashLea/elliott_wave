In the European system, where devices are regulated by private entities, guidelines are rigorous but also clear and consistent.  As a result, studies have shown that innovative, life-saving devices reach patients much quicker in Europe and have no greater incidence of adverse events.  As an added benefit, Europe has seen an increase in jobs and innovation as companies avoid the uncertain and bureaucratic regulatory environment in the U.S.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3025228, "replies": [], "lft": 140, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/health/28institute.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4238438, "rgt": 141, "userDisplayName": "Kelcy", "createDate": "1311827237", "userID": 43068131, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1311827438", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Colorado", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1311823838", "commentSequence": 60, "commentBody": "Well, you get what you pay for.

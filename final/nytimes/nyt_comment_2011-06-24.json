I never met him and am glad - just reading about his behavior makes my hair stand up.  He terrorized people.  He was much feared and for good reason. He and his siblings grew up in a very tough housing project for the poor (mostly Irish Americans) in South Boston.  And then, in incredible contrast, you had his younger brother, a man who never has been arrested in his life, William \"Billy\" Bulger, a graduate of the famed Boston Latin School who knew Greek and Latin and quoted from the ancient classics and who was no less than President of the Massachusetts Senate for 25 years, later President of the University of Massachusetts and who purported to have no idea whatsoever what had happened to his mobster brother.  This is why the story of the Bulger brothers and their family is so riveting to Massachusetts residents, especially those of the older generation.", "recommendationCount": 100}, {"assetID": 2887355, "replies": [], "lft": 40, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/us/24bulger.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4045293, "rgt": 41, "userDisplayName": "AudioGuy", "createDate": "1308885901", "userID": 56500176, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1308888517", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Nashville", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1308884917", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "I thought they'd find Whitey in Pakistan....\r<br/><br/>also, poster Number 4 needs to get his facts right; Whitey's brother Billy was NEVER<br/>\nmayor of Boston, though he was the Senate leader in the Mass. legislature for something like 17 years before he ran the University of Massachusetts system until Mitt ran him out because he knew that would reflect badly on him later during his presidential run in 2008.", "recommendationCount": 27}, {"assetID": 2887355, "replies": [], "lft": 42, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/us/24bulger.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4045317, "rgt": 43, "userDisplayName": "Chris B.", "createDate": "1308886488", "userID": 3003176, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1308888526", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boston", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1308884926", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "A couple of corrections: Whitey's brother Billy was not mayor of Boston.

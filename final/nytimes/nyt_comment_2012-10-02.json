That pill over the Steeler cornerback on the first play of overtime in last's season's playoffs that went to the house for the win....you don't see that very often. Perfect read, perfect pass.<br/><br/>Tebow's intangibles dominate Sanchez. He is a natural leader, he is a physical baller, he is a very big man, and he doesn't get enough credit for his reads. Tebow often knows exactly where to go with the ball. He tends to be overly cautious instead of sticking it in there, and some of his balls just plain miss, but if you've been watching our quarterback play this season, we've already got ourselves one of those. For those of you looking for a reason not to insert Tebow, accuracy is not your strongest claim. Sanchez is near the bottom of the league in accuracy.<br/><br/>Tebow deserves to run the first team offense, the full package, with some option plays thrown in to take advantage of his agility. He can also pitch, then block. I'm not afraid of Tebow getting hurt if he's the one moving forward. He's a big man.<br/><br/>If Sanchez' desultory play has not earned him a trip to the bench, then what would? The Jets beat Miami almost in spite of Sanchez, and he was certainly the chief culprit in the 49ers blowout. Yes the defense missed tackles and so on, but most of that damage came in the second half when they were dog tired because the inept offense couldn't keep them off the field.<br/><br/>I say it is Tebow Time.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3341572, "replies": [], "lft": 15, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/vigilance-about-the-dangers-of-delirium/", "parentID": 7269784, "commentID": 7271197, "rgt": 16, "userDisplayName": "DHC", "createDate": "1349149455", "userID": 59773330, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1349150774", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Del Mar, CA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1349147174", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Mel, I think you have some excellent ideas.

The revolving two week shift of young doctors did not help his care.  The hospital also opted for sedating my father over granting our exhausted family a sitter to watch him, to help wean him from the drugs, provide him company/reality and to give our family a day's rest.    That denial of a sitter (because they are more expensive than sedatives or antipsychotic drugs) resulted in my father falling in his delirious state.  My dear father lost dignity and underwent enormous and perhaps needless stress shortly before his death weeks later.  Those awful days will forever be burned in our memory.

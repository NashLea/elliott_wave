So, here's my question - - my vegetarian diet is just too starchy.  I love beans and rice, but whoa, starch galore. Tofu, great, but how much tofu can a person eat?  I am not one of the slender wood nymphish vegetarians, and I think the root of my problem is too much starch, too many carbs, not enough protein that is carb free.

We observe a constant conjunction, to use Hume's term, of things that are suited to certain purposes, on the one hand, and designers, on the other.

We have experience of only one universe.  We don't know why the physical constants have the values they have, or whether these values would have a low or high probability if there were no intelligent designer.

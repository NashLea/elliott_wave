I may as well have reported a mini-bar in my room. I start back, but then turn to the clerk.<br /><br />\"May I have a broom?\"<br /><br />\"Why, sir?  Has there been a spill? Shall I summon housekeeping?\"<br /><br />\"No. That's all right.  I'll handle it myself,\" I tell her.<br /><br />And walk slowly back to my room, muttering to myself.  \"But of course there's a rat, you fool.  It was complimentary, don't you know?

This team was a steamroller from that point on.<br /><br />There are already many reasons why the 2010 Jets may need similar time to come together. High among them is  the need for ownership to emerge, for leadership to rise from the ranks. This is true for most teams every several seasons, rare exceptions being those players who lead their teams for much longer. Rarer still among Jets.<br /><br />To the naked eye, we see plenty of leadership being cut and plenty of responsibility handed to newcomers. We are likely to see, in the first part of the season, this team grasp about for leadership and consistency. We may be inclined to scream to the high heavens, why did we let this or that player go?<br /><br />There is no faster maturation process than the first year in the NFL. You start as a baby and you come out as a man. There is a reason they say \"there are no rookies in the post-season;\" their rookie season was the regular season; the post-season is their second season and they know what to do by now.<br /><br />In other words, young players make great leaps in their first NFL season. If you have the right guys, then you expect them to rise to the level expected of an NFL player and you expect them to jell as a team.<br /><br />You would like to see it happen sooner than later, but as 2009's Jets demonstrated, just get into the tournament, baby.<br /><br />I will not be shocked to see a 4-4 record after 8 games. Certainly we need to get the roster squared away and we need time to cohere, so that to me is the first half of the season.<br /><br />The second half I look forward to at least 6 wins, and I hope that 10 wins gets you in.<br /><br />So the moral of the story is, don't be so quick to criticize the lack of leadership and consistency at the start of the season. The organization has made a bet that these things will emerge, and so we can to some extent allow that process to unfold and look at progress as much in that was as in the W/L column, at lest at the outset.<br /><br />If this season falls apart, we can all look back at the end and admit that too many risks were taken with lack of continuity.<br /><br />On the other hand, if these guys rise to the opportunities they're being given, this could be a mighty exciting and in some sense era-defining year for this franchise.<br /><br />Parting ways is definitely hard to do, but we have to have faith in the newcomers. They're our guys now, and the organization chose to go with them instead of the veterans. It's a leap of  faith we must take, because the alternative is what happened during the Herm Edwards era, when a ruthless purge was so sorely needed and there was all that guaranteed money to deal with.<br /><br />I don't expect many takers for a return to that era.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1816899, "replies": [], "lft": 56, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/turning-back/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2497072, "rgt": 57, "userDisplayName": "eveningclouds", "createDate": "1283746726", "userID": 46971525, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1283752656", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "california", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1283749056", "commentSequence": 28, "commentBody": "Lots of folks seemed to like this puzzle and I just didn't, and I'm not sure why.

I loved the win, but that quarterback, as nice as he seems to be, won't last the season at this rate.  The Big 10 is not the semi-pro league that the SEC has become, because maybe they care too much about graduating players.  But there's some big, fast kids that'll eventually fall on that quarterback.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1817339, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/few-visitors-in-boise-to-broncos-chagrin/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2496572, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "AlGersten", "createDate": "1283731685", "userID": 39505312, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1283761923", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1283758323", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Trust me, the major conference teams could afford taking a one-time dollar hit and play at Boise IF they were seeking out good competition.

It's a disgrace - a rip-off for fans - but nowadays money trumps competition. There are few schools left which will take on all comers; USC, Georgia, Colorado, and a couple of others.

Even so, how about a return match between BSU and VT in, say, Salt Lake City? Or even Denver? Lots of larger venues are close enough to Boise to make them as much a home field as Landover will be for VT. Fair's fair. I don't believe BSU will win this game, and I don't believe that BSU, Utah, TCU, BYU, etc, belong at the top of the ratings. But it's time the BCS teams stopped dodging these guys and made them prove it on the field. Consistently. C'mon, BCS teams.

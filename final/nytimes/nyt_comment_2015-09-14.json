That is, economics, politics, and thought -- in short the ideology of the antebellum South -- was predicated on the defense and extension of slavery<br/><br/>*Americans, southerners and northerners alike, increasingly justified the mass enslavement of people of African descent as natural. By the 19th century this justification relied on scientific explanations, creating what we today call race. <br/><br/>*Slavery was fundamental to US westward expansion, the growth of capitalism, and of industry<br/><br/>*Finally, US Southerners were one of the few groups of slaveholders to argue that slavery was a positive good, an argument they continued to advance as wide swaths of the world embraced liberal free labor<br/><br/>Making students aware of these differences, especially the entrenchment of slavery, is not advancing a political agenda.

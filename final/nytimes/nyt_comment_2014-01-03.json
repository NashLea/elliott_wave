Cooking prevents damage to the thyroid. Juicing vegetables often results in consumption of greater quantities than if prepared otherwise. Rather than throwing in the towel, succumbing to the lure of the Twinkie and missing out on all the known beneficial phytonutrients in kale and related plants, the author should simply consume her Brassicas cooked. <br/><br/>An 80 year old nutritional mystery has been solved in time to benefit the author's dentition. Dr. Weston A.Price was a dental surgeon who became frustrated with repair work when the cause went unaddressed. He roamed the world in the 1920s visiting isolated peoples still living on their native diets. Price determined that a factor existed in butter from pastured cows that protected teeth. In the 1920s analytical methods were inadequate to determine the chemical nature of this nutrient so Price called it Activator-X. Recently it has been determined that Price's food factor was Vitamin K2. This nutrient, with different sources and actions than Vitamin K1, has two major functions with regard to the metabolism of calcium in our bodies. [1] It directs calcium to teeth and bones where you want it. [2] It removes calcium from soft tissues like arteries, veins and aorta where you don't want it. Vitamin K2 activated matrix gla protein is the strongest inhibitor of tissue calcification presently known.

Period. I don't know what else there is to discuss in this. Nobody seems to question that De Jong should have been hauled off to jail after 28 minutes. Had the ref done his job at that point, I don't think there's much doubt that a 10 man Dutch team could have survived 60 minutes of relentless Spanish control. And had they turned even nastier (would that have been possible?), then a 9 man Dutch team probably would have been looking at a 7 or 8 to nothing score by the end of the match. And everyone would have _enjoyed_ the spectacle (except the Dutch fans), as no doubt Spain would have made a delightful exhibition of it. But the Dutch (soccer) fans weren't going to enjoy the match no matter what happened--either getting slaughtered by the Spanish with few players on the field, or seeing what actually happened (thugs and criminals running the show).<br /><br />Everyone seems to agree \"the best team won\". So the only other thing you can really say about all this is that the ref made the wrong choice by attempting to keep it \"equal\" by not sending off the Dutch.

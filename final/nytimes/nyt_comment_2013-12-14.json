In the past, it was the huge, multi-story public housing projects of despair that got attention for their massive failure. Many cities have torn down those projects, finally concluding that what was intended as a act of kindness was actually the opposite.<br/><br/>Where I live, Montgomery County, Maryland, one of the richest counties in the nation, a relatively enlightened form of housing assistance is offered. Lower cost housing is dispersed among higher cost units so that those on assistance are not placed in islands of poverty and family breakdown. The surrounding middle class areas are not significantly altered. It seems to be working fairly well.<br/><br/>A key issue in a massive city like New York is the availability of decent housing at non-millionaire pricing. Perhaps the builders who put up the 50 story towers in Manhattan could be required to build, and operate, a set number of affordable units in other areas of the city in exchange for the right to make millions on office towers of glass and steel. <br/><br/>I would favor a three to five yr. program whereby the family would be given money, on a declining scale, to establish themselves economically.

Rather, as the wealthiest nation that ever existed we are the last ones who can afford it. Switzerland was one of the last advanced economies to abandon market-priced medical care. It is arguably a greater bastion of conservatism than the USA. Switzerland's women were not granted the right to vote until 1971. <br/><br/>The reason that no nation, including the wealthiest can allow markets to set the prices of medical care indefinitely is that demand for medical care is inelastic. Demand for a good or service is inelastic if a percentage increase in price results in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity demanded. Basic economics tells us that sellers facing inelastic demand will continuously raise prices until prices reach the elastic portion of the demand curve. Consequently in every developed country in the world, all goods or services with inelastic demand have their prices regulated by government. Medical care in the USA being the only exception.<br/><br/>Health care is one of the very few things for which the sellers face inelastic demand. The prices of all other goods and services facing inelastic demand in the USA are regulated by government. Retail electricity service providers face inelastic demand.

The point he needed to make and forcefully is the Republican Party got us into this mess and they are to blame for what has happened and they need to act like grownups and help fix it.

I always use a number of criteria in my searches, and most importantly, use a number of sources to compare results. On my recent round the world trip, I needed 9 hotels in 9 different countries over 18 days. I planned ahead, focusing on my primary criteria first: View, quality/safety (in-room safe, amenities), location (proximity to what I want to visit) and then price (ideally under $200 a night). I started with looking for the best view recommendations for each destination on Tripadvisor.com, then compared price and availability on either the hotel's own site or two different discount sites (<a href=\"http://Hotels.com\" title=\"Hotels.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hotels.com</a> and <a href=\"http://Travelocity.com\" title=\"Travelocity.com\" target=\"_blank\">Travelocity.com</a> where I had accounts). Then I made my shortlist and refined further by reading tripadvisor and <a href=\"http://hotels.com\" title=\"hotels.com\" target=\"_blank\">hotels.com</a> guest reviews - as well as a few random Google searches for the same. Sure, it takes time, but the hassle it saves, and the improved travel experience it creates, well, it's well worth the effort. Bottom line, check at least two sources of information, check to make sure reviews are timely and also, consider reading some reviews made at the same time of year you are traveling (it's how you get good tips on weather, climate and other helpful info!)<br/>\nYou can see the results of my trip, and my hotel selections and experiences in my Travel Photo book for iPad: Around The World In 18 Days, now available on the App Store for iPad.

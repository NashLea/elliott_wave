Free Throws - #9 all-time in % and #12 in FT made (no one in the top 30 of FT made has a better percentage).  Iced game regardless of the situation.<br />2.  Clutch Ability - There's 1 second left.  It's your ball out of bounds, and you're down by 3.  There is no player in the history of the game you'd rather have on your team at that scenario.<br />3.  The defense claim:  He is 39 steals from the top 30 all-time.  Half a season at his pace.  He was never a defensive liability.<br />4.  #14 in total points.  Compare that to Home Runs.  Without steroid-era players, it's the equivalent of Ted Williams or Ernie Banks.<br />5.  His assist numbers are lower because of the offense he played in.  His job was to run his defender into the ground, through double screens, catch, and shoot.  The only reason for an assist pass was if the low post defender cheated, in which case the point guard usually makes an entry pass to the post.  It's an assist caused by Reggie.  Check out Mark Jackson's numbers.<br />6.  A career dealing with Smits' bad feet, O'Neal's fragility, management's poor decision making with their enforcer big men (Brad Miller and Antonio Davis) and Ron Artest's difficult battle with mental illness.<br /><br />My final point: Go back and watch games from his final season. The brawl season.  A season that should have been lost. He's 39 with gimpy O'Neal/Tinsley.  And he still beats the Celts, and only loses to the Pistons cause Prince has a 7'3\" wingspan.<br /><br />So he hangs it up in the city that loves him, and doesn't go ring-chasing and number-piling when he clearly still could (and had offers to do so).

There is a public interest, and it is not served by subsidizing unhealthy processed foods.<br /><br />     The brilliance of the corporate strategy of lobbying the government to allow unlabeled GM foods into the entire food supply is that HEALTH EFFECTS CANNOT BE TRACED OR MEASURED.  It's easy for corporations to deny potential health impacts when no one can scientifically prove them wrong.  We really don't know what we're eating, unless you have the money to buy foods that specifically are labeled as \"non-GMO.\"  For decades, the political appointees to the USDA have had cozy ties to industry (to which they immediately return after their short stint as \"regulators\" of agribusiness), so it isn't shocking that corporate interests would be placed above public health concerns.<br /><br />     We form governments to improve our lives.  Our political differences come from a difference in views on the proper role of government (to what extent should government attempt to get involved in any given area, be it social or economic).  Whether you advocate a laissez-faire role for government or mistrust corporations' willingness/ability to regulate themselves (their corporate charters will, by law, place profit over competing interests such as public health or environmental protection), I think we can all agree that our government, through more or less regulation, should not ACTIVELY MAKE THINGS WORSE!  Our government's subsidization of GM corn (cows weren't meant to eat corn!) and corn-based ethanol (a net LOSS of energy, but no politician dare say so!) contributes directly to processed food as the foundation of the American diet (translation: increased health costs), and, on a wider scale, to increased global food prices (translation: increased global political instability).<br /><br />   I'm no economist, but I can recognize that a higher propensity for diabetes and increased global conflicts have costs that surely offset saving a few cents on the cost of the overly-processed food that I shouldn't be eating anyway.<br /><br />  While it is easy to be cynical in the current political environment, one tool we have left as citizens (human ones, not corporate \"citizens\") is to SHAME politicians and political appointees into making decisions in the PUBLIC interest through sheer force of numbers.  We must not assume that someone else will, and we owe this to future generations who have a right to know what they are eating.<br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2415732, "replies": [], "lft": 1632, "assetURL": "http://bittman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/what-do-you-think-about-genetically-engineered-food/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3413784, "rgt": 1633, "userDisplayName": "Charlie", "createDate": "1298222195", "userID": 60323306, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1298269042", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Mountaindale, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1298269042", "commentSequence": 793, "commentBody": "Yes to all four.

Yes - There is so much \"perceived\" conflict of interest right now with our regulatory agencies and Monsanto that I am not comfortable with decisions made currently that are based solely on studies provided by Monsanto.  There needs to be independent studies done as well.<br />4. No - I will and am currently curbing all my purchases of farm-raised salmon.

I studied plant biology, genetics, &amp; sustainable agriculture at one of the leading agricultural universities in the world, MSU.<br />In all fairness, these questions are exactly what those opposed to the preservation of organic &amp; heirloom seed &amp; live stock growers want you to ask. Promoters of GMO's know that once the pollen of a GMO crosses with an organic or an heirloom, it is lost forever. The current legal system favors those who own the copyright to the GMO, even claiming legal ownership to seedstock that maybe an heirloom or an organic that has cross pollinated. There are many other complex legal &amp; ethical questions that this simple survey fails to address. GMO companies want you to believe that they are merely altering traits of the plant such as disease resistances but the vast majority of plants have been altered to only grow when an expensive chemical is sprayed on the plant, ensuring totally dependency on products such as Roundup. Imagine the nightmare this has caused for organic or heirloom growers that raise their own seedstock. GMO pollen has contaminated Mexico's ancient seed stock and threatens other crops such as sugar beets &amp; alfalfa. These GMO plants only grow by chemical spray applications that include pesticides &amp; herbicides, not altered traits. Those who attempt to promote foods derived from GMO's by arguing label issues &amp; avoiding the true nature of the plants genetic alteration continue to muddle the water of a populace that has shied away from scientific reason &amp; ethical responsibility.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2433532, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/business/media/21carr.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3415096, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Podesta", "createDate": "1298265900", "userID": 8264296, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1298270536", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Portland", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1298270536", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "It would be difficult for anyone to write a more one-sided article than this one.  The foundation error is the claim Apple has a monopoly in anything.  The company is a market leader in only one of the half-dozen fields it participates in - selling music.  Even there, it is not a monopoly, which requires controlling entry to a market and subverting competition.  The iPod leads among music players, but the iPod touch is really a part of the general multimedia and communications device market.  Again, Apple does nothing to stifle competition.<br /><br />Second, it is important to understand Google and Apple are selling different things with their subscription markets.  Google's subscriptions are for reading in a browser, while Apple's are for apps.  That makes the former less valuable. Google does not already have an established base of thousands of content using iPad apps to manage and promote.  Apple does.  Google also does not offer the number of affluent potential subscribers Apple does.  Clearly, the additional 20% charged by Apple pays for important attributes.<br /><br />Last, but not least, Google has another way of making money in addition to the 10% fee.    It, unlike Apple, will not allow subscribers to keep their personal details and data private.  Instead our identities and interests  will be mined for Google ads and resold to data merchants.  That may be worth more to Google than 20% more in fees from publishers.<br /><br />These are fundamental differences between the two platforms this article fails to address.

How do you know the law will promote racial profiling? The law has just been enacted. You know nothing about what will happen. You are just making assumptions. Since you stated that you just completed study in Constitutional Law, how can you know the real life practicalities of border enforcement? Theory is one thing. Practical application is another. Governors like Jan Brewer must deal with the real situation and the needs and wants of their constituents. Racial profiling is fine with me. It really comes down to political correctness. If law enforcement officials have reasonable justification to stop someone who may be breaking the law, it should be done.<br /><br />Reply to Martin 44--- I am more than willing to pay higher taxes for any and all law enforcement to stop illegal immigration into NYS and to deport every single illegal immigrant in NYS. That would be money well spent. I would put the U.S. Navy around the Eastern seaboard.

However, if he does go, what will be the entity that blows his leaving during (the next two year crises) on a presidential mission totally out of proportion if he takes the trip?   You guessed it the media.<br /><br />Please Mr. and Mrs. Journalists and Pundit and Punditress...Inform and educate, but for heaven's sake please stop manipulating we poor lemmings just to get in front of that red eye, or be invited to take a chair during the Sunday morning roundtable (s).<br /><br />Do it for your family there is remember there is something still called American posterity.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1520506, "replies": [], "lft": 192, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/another-candidate-another-job-offer/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2078589, "rgt": 193, "userDisplayName": "Roget", "createDate": "1275615949", "userID": 59651537, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1275626849", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bone Gap", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1275623249", "commentSequence": 89, "commentBody": "Tony....

I am sure that notoriety aside, Gallaraga would certainly get a lot of money had the 27th batter been called out. Furthermore, if this had been a 1 run game and the next Indian slugged a home run. The Tigers could have lost. That loss would possibly cost them the pennant.<br /><br />All that aside, no fan wants a bad call ruining their enjoyment and his team.s success.

Minor theologians acknowledge the prescience of primal memory and its predatory nature.

Remember that in Aeschylus' \"Prometheus Bound\", Zeus &amp; Prometheus squared off as they represented the forces of intelligence and the invisible symbol of force respectively.  Prometheus after all was the first great rebel of Western civilization as he represented the power of human determination against the concept of fate &amp; concealed forces beyond man's control.  What is it that upset people about the death of Cecil the famous lion who was monitored hour by hour by the prestigious Oxford University?  Was it the repulsion of the hunter's all too human need to dominate &amp; subject the powerful beast much like Prometheus' power to steal the secret power of fire?  Why does the collective human population mourn for the loss of a rare mammal whose power mankind has yoked &amp; harnessed into near extinction for centuries? Could it be similar to the desire for man to remain autonomous from the 4 legged creatures as much as from the power &amp; time honored Zeus himself?

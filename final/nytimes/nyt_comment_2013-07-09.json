Yet, what we've learned is that currents in our social evolution are governed increasingly by the wad, which in turn are increasingly governed by commercial interest and its supporting manipulation.<br/><br/>In 1500 CE, life was stark and tenuous. That strikes me as manifestly sufficient reason for masses of people to tolerate voluntary herding into atomic religious groups that defined community, membership in which was the primary compensation for inadequate food, dreary and arduous labor, powerless lives and early death; and it also promised a better world, sometimes even in the company of complacent virgins.<br/><br/>As we've developed economically, life has become, for large numbers, quite different: they eat better, live longer, work less hard, and have many more distractions to consume time. Small surprise that they'd be less dependent on a formal shaman and framework to define community: they can choose from among numerous communities. Yet, we still die, eventually, so some ethereal thread mitigating that reality is still sought; but it needn't necessarily be based on images of cross and nails.<br/><br/>And that's as much of a response to a book report that I can manage in 1500 characters (including spaces).", "recommendationCount": 146}, {"assetID": 3376444, "replies": [], "lft": 61, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/opinion/brooks-the-secular-society.html", "parentID": 9414753, "commentID": 9415073, "rgt": 62, "userDisplayName": "oncepermile", "createDate": "1373342417", "userID": 14826983, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1373342647", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Katy TX", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1373339047", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Pascal's Wager, I presume.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3376444, "replies": [], "lft": 163, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/opinion/brooks-the-secular-society.html", "parentID": 9414995, "commentID": 9415082, "rgt": 164, "userDisplayName": "Steve Bolger", "createDate": "1373342560", "userID": 47648965, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1373342647", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New York City.", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1373339047", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Once one grasps the scale-independence of self-organizing systems, it is obvious that the God invented by humans exists in the identical existential condition.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3376443, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/opinion/nocera-justice-louisiana-style.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9414907, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "2bits", "createDate": "1373340846", "userID": 16399024, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1373342668", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Nashville", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1373339068", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "was the 75 million cap really an option?

Global warming is a fact, but it may not be the accelerator on the climate changes, in my opinion. Rather, I think it's more like gun powder. When left alone, it's inert. This is because the of Earth's great capacity to neutralize volatility and regulate its thermostat. Earth's greatest heat-cold buffer is in its ocean. After all, water is the greatest buffer of all things, including the acid-base of life. It's a good thing that the earth is covered 75% by water, which helps to regulate the thermostat. Earth didn't get to this point overnight, but rather by a cooling process over billions of years. While gun powder is inert, when there is a spark, it can trigger a combustion and a chain reaction to the last molecule. Major events in nature, such as the death of the dinosaurs, the Ice Age, happened because there were catalytic events. It usually has to do with the disruption of the ocean. No scientists have yet to connect all the dots but I believe it started in the Pacific Ocean. It's circulation is clockwise.

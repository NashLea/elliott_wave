The Republicans wanted a much worse bill. Many, many leaders in the AA community begged for the bill.  <br/><br/>It is sad, to me, that not enough people, excepting John Lewis, for example,  considered how LEO and prosecutors might apply the law - picking on people of color and going after the little guy on the street rather than the big dealers.<br/>And, yet, in an era of gang violence and the crack epidemic destroying poor communities, the bill as flawed as it was did do some good.  <br/><br/>Some of the whites, here, might try reading the work of black folks on that bill and its context.

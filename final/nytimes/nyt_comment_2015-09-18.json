If no one on the left comes up with something workable, we are left with non-workable xenophobic plans Trump's.<br/><br/>Here are some thoughts:<br/>(1) Do away with citizenship based merely on where the baby is born; base it instead on the parents' citizenship status. If one parent is a citizen (native or naturalized), regardless of where the child is born, that child  is automatically a US citizen (that's how it works right now anyway).<br/>(2) Current illegal Immigrants do serve a purpose in the national economy.  Figure out a way for them to work here legally but with limited status.<br/>(3) Limit the number of children the US will support for people here with work permits. E.g. two children at most, after that, the family is on the hook for everything else.  I think many immigrants would be happy for their kids to have a chance to grow up in the US that even limited benefits would be seen as great but we don't need to give them everything.

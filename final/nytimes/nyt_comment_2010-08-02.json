First, particularly with the shift to 100% direct lending July 1, the federal student loan program is a money-maker for taxpayers, just as most banks in the history of the world have been money-makers (or else why would anyone ever want to be a bank?)<br /><br />Default rates of federal student loans, even after 20 or 30 years, are very low. Default rates have been declining for decades and will continue to decline in the short term. In the longer term, default rates will increase if the recession continues too long.  Post-default, however, almost all the loans are collected, because not only are there a wide variety of collection tools, such as administrative wage garnishment, offset of any federal benefits received (including tax refunds!) and rehabilitation, but it is almost impossible to get a federal debt discharged in bankruptcy.<br /><br />Certain types of schools, which, to-date, represent a small minority of borrowers, exhibit extremely high default rates for borrowers and loans associated with their attendance. However, unless, and until, those schools\u2019 market share increases significantly, we won\u2019t see a \u201cnational\u201d default rate, even after 20 or 30 years, of anywhere near 40 percent ( a figure pulled out of the air by some of the most radical, pro-amnesty debtor lobbyists). Even borrowers who already have a past history of student loan defaults \u2014 the most risky group \u2014 will only show an ultimate default rate of 40 to 60 percent.<br /><br />Second, there seems to be a ton of confusion between the federal student loans (guaranteed, direct and \u201cPerkins\u201d) and the private educational loans. These are totally different sets of borrower terms, conditions and benefits and, for maximum clarity, should not be discussed in the same post. Private educational loans were fully-dischargeable in bankruptcy to the same extent as credit card, automobile, mortgage and other consumer debts, until 2005.<br /><br />Private education loans can be underwritten like a mortgage or any type of consumer or business credit product. Except for a brief period where things got out of hand (due to excess liquidity and relatively-new means of liquidity \u2014 securitization, ABS, and warehousing) in the mid-2000s, these products have generally been tightly underwritten. The downside, of course, is that, in contrast to a mortgage or car loan, there is no collateral (the co-signers may have plenty of assets though).<br /><br />The federally-guaranteed education loans are almost risk-free \u2014 default has almost no impact on loan holder or guarantee agency \u2014 and this is where the international investors who supplied much of the capital during the 2000s misunderstood the product and got out at the worst possible time for the American marketers (\u201cbanks,\u201d nonbank lenders, state lenders, and nonprofit lenders) of the federally-guaranteed student loans. These foreign investors equated a guaranteed student loan with a non-guaranteed subprime mortgage, when, in reality, it was the safest investment around for a financier.<br /><br />Third, student loans are a symptom, not the disease. The American system of postsecondary education finance is the disease. However, the federal student aid system can definitely be used as a tool to strong-arm schools into fixing the disease, because right now there are probably less than 20 colleges in the USA which could survive more than a semester without the cash flow provided by the federal student aid programs. That leverage provides a strong carrot and a strong stick. The politically weak federal education dept, though, has always acted as more of an arm of the schools, lenders and guaranty agencies than the boss of them. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that the expenditure power and the leverage of the strings attached to federal monies are some of the strongest Constitutional powers of the federal govt.<br /><br />Maybe the time has come to make use of these legitimate powers to restrain educational costs. Sure, there will be cries of \u201csocialism,\u201d but why should the taxpayer pay all the bills (many colleges receive 90% of their revenue from Pell Grants and fed'l student loan proceeds) and not have some say in how the monies are spent? It would be like a parent serving as mere checkbook for a child without any say in what the child can do for the first 18 years of life . . .", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1700622, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/subprime-colleges-revisited/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2332979, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Craigie", "createDate": "1280607457", "userID": 60490763, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1280731314", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Oak, VA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1280727714", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "There is massive confusion about who benefits from the loans (schools, lenders, govt., and/or students) -- that is, the \"incidence\" of the programs -- and who bears the risk (schools, lenders, govt., and/or students).  The analysis is very, very different, for each of the four \"players.\"<br /><br />The risk for lenders and guaranty agencies is almost zero.  An international investor would be stupid not to invest in federally-guaranteed student loans (and many were \"stupid\" after they got confused between mortgages, which had only a vaguely-implied federal backstop, and student loans, where loans are not only guaranteed against default but also lenders and guarantors are guaranteed a minimum quarterly rate of return!).<br /><br />Yes, there will be no more \"new\" guaranteed student loans issued after June 30, 2010, but there is $500 billion outstanding, much of which is still ripe for monitization and securitization, except for the fact that \"savvy\" international investors -- after going whole-hog during 2000-2007 -- are on the sidelines, confused by the in-apt comparisons to \"Fannie/Freddie.\"<br /><br />On the other hand, Eric the Red is wrong.  In neither the guaranteed nor direct loan programs have the feds ever been allowed to assess \"creditworthiness of the student,\" except for a six-month period at the beginning of the 1990s, when most lenders opted not to do so anyway, because of the huge costs of an individualized underwriting process performed upon millions of loans annually.  Yes, there is a bare-bones \"credit check\" for parent borrowers, but it is extremely minimal, compared to what you would see for the typical consumer credit and housing credit application processes.  Federal student aid is a social welfare program -- an entitlement program -- and the goal is access to postsecondary education, not performing obsessive audits of participants, whether they be schools, lenders, guarantors or borrowers.<br /><br />So, yes, the schools will do ANYTHING to protect that cash flow, even quashing all discussion about possible ways to help borrowers who are no longer in school and need help.  Even ideas that have no taxpayer cost are quashed, because the schools need to keep the public policy discussions focused on students who are in school and students planning to enter school in the future.  There are probably less than 20 colleges in the country that would survive more than six months if federal Pell Grant and student loan programs were to stop pumping out cash flow.  They simply would be unable to meet payroll.<br /><br />Eric the Red is also incorrect about billing and collections.  The schools have nothing to do with it.  The exception is the tiny Perkins loan program, which dates from the late 1950s and whose institutional stratification dates from the 1970s.  Thus, very, very few trade schools are in the Perkins loan program.  In addition to an institutional formulation which favors schools that were already in the program in the 1970s, the Perkins program and the other \"campus based programs\" require an institutional contribution to the mix -- something a for-profit school would generally never be interested in.  Always use \"other peoples' money\"!<br /><br />In the guaranteed and direct loan programs, which, in recent years have provided 75 to 100 times the annual new loan volume than the Perkins program, schools are not involved in servicing the loans at all.  It is either a loan servicer contracted by the lender, or a loan servicer contracted by the feds (for the direct loan program).  Post-default, the schools are even less involved in the collections process.<br /><br />Yes, it is possible for schools with high default rates to be terminated from the federal program, but it has only been one or two schools per year, versus the thousands removed during the early 1990s.  It is almost impossible for borrowers to default during the tiny time-frame that is used to measure institutional default rates, and the rates must be extremely high for schools to be snagged by the limits.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1653906, "replies": [], "lft": 44, "assetURL": "http://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/american-creativity-in-decline/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2334808, "rgt": 45, "userDisplayName": "prof", "createDate": "1280681912", "userID": 2609, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1280737380", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Oregon", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1280733779", "commentSequence": 22, "commentBody": "I have a couple of patents, and quite a few ideas I did not bother patenting.

Tom's program had the virtue that anyone could use it and get a readable result.  Furthermore, it was consistent -- you knew what to expect when reading someone else's program.

He had modified the sndmsg program, the message-sending application for Tenex, the PDP-10 operating system he co-authored with Dan Murphy, to transmit message across the network by talking to the FTP server running on the target machine, if my memory serves (at that time, FTP was already in regular use for transmitting  files from host to host across the ARPANet, as was Telnet, used to log in to remote hosts). I joined BBN in late 1972, so I believe Ray's work occurred in 1973, not 1971. It's certainly possible I've got this wrong, but that's my recollection.<br/><br/>As for inventing email, we had a messaging system on the CP/CMS system running at the MIT Lincoln Lab as early as 1968. We ran CP/CMS at Interactive Data in the late 1960s/early 1970s and sndmsg/readmail were important components in our communication (I worked in the operating system group there). Before Ray's breakthrough, messaging confined to one Tenex system was in regular use at BBN.<br/><br/>So while what Ray did was extremely important, his work certainly was not the first instance of electronic messaging. But those earlier messages didn't flow over networks; sender and receiver were always on the same system.

It was, rather, that they had been forced to undergo various experiences of ultra-religiosity with each new set of foster parents until they finally \"aged out.\" Although it is not for me to judge Ms. Bachman's intentions, it is a sad truth that many foster \"parents\" choose to enter into the foster care system not only for the money, but also for the opportunity to proselytize and impose their religious belief systems on vulnerable young minds.

For instance, I go out to a local bar/club where bands are playing that evening. There's a door charge of $5 to enter that night.  No, I don't resent the cover charge.  In the case of bookstores, the \"cover charge\"isn't split with the author.  It goes to  support the independent bookstore.  Why should this be a problem?  Independent bookstores aren't selling drinks and alcohol.  They profit from book sales at the event--and then waive the cover charge with a book purchase.  In the process, like paying a cover charge to support local bands, I have supported my community bookstore, which I don't want to fail.  Special University events in my area, when they aren't free, offer student and other sorts of discounts.  This is easy to implement (senior and student IDs).  As ECA noted, expecting something for nothing under the conditions in which independent booksellers could become a thing of the past is just going to hurry along the process.  Seeing authors live and having them available to answer questions and sign book copies isn't worth $5 ?  if cheap wine and cheese is offered, would people complain less?

If obsolescence is part of the cause that stimulates demand, isn't it obvious that wealth, never obsolescene, doesn't have to be traded in or replaced? Increasing wealth through tax cuts doesn't increase demand! Capital formation long ago separated from its ties to labor; unlike Henry Ford, the new capitalists (Romney) doesn't need to produce units for the margin utility of profit. The excessive value of labor--stored as capital, extracted as fees, reordered balance sheets, raided pensions and benefits--is in private hands.<br/><br/>Because of powerful, private hands, Romney-Ryan attempt a moral arugment framed in political terms. Your taxes are going to Obamacare; your taxes are the source of a Democratic spending spree; your taxes pay welfare without work. Private rights are supreme, all else is socialism, dangerous, wrong. Their morality is tied to wealth, not reality.<br/><br/>In reality, each of us knows neighbors and families without health care who benefit; budgets can whack away at programs that don't have an immediate impact on the quality of life we share in common, and the citizens of states should be free to choose the path best to restore work for their unemployed. Freedom expands opportunity.<br/><br/>Many think freedom is only possible with a balanced budget; that we are shackled to debt.

That regulatory oversight does not, however, extend to encouraging banks to make loans because doing so would be good for the economy in general.  The banks aren't lending because they are often too concerned about the their own balance sheets' ability to withstand stress testing and real stress from withdrawals and loan defaults.   Here in Georgia bankers have  many examples of banks that failed and of  managers and directors whose reputations were destroyed, and they are consequently focused more on their bank's survival than on lending.  The recent FED action addresses their fears by replacing shaky mortgage loans receivable on their balance sheets with FED reserves, a change it hopes will result in broader lending, greater employment and growth.<br/><br/>The FED action also effectively drives real interest rates negative by fostering an expectation of inflation.  This makes the opportunity cost of sitting on cash balances higher,  the hurdle rate of return on investment lower, and should therefore spur private investment. <br/><br/>It isn't Machiavelli who can best  account for what we see in the economy today.

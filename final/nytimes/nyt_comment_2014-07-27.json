It isn't cherry picking to limit the number of sources one can cite, especially in an 800 word column.  But he always links to his sources so the industrious reader can check his facts.  The reader is also left to believe what he wants to believe, even when the facts in evidence stronly support PK's conclusions, and sometimes it doesn't take much to refute a conclusion.

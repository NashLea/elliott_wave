To me, citizenship by birth right is so 1970's; b4 the internet, affordable plane tickets, and modern civilizations that resemble each other more than they are different.<br />Citizenship in its legal form is just a way for governments to tax and control voting/spending (not what guarantees the right to basic human rights by all individuals living in a specific location, and the voting thing, since special interest groups can now donate whatever and buy politicians, is also becoming a pathetic excuse).  People who are against legalizing immigrants\u2019 status need to make up their minds, either citizenship is a birth right that gives an individual claims to nationalism or it is a feeling of belonging more in one particular society after a considerable period of time than any other.<br />Classes of citizenship are wrong! Being able to retain an alien card and a path to citizenship bc you have 150K in a bank account is wrong too, according to American values, but it\u2019s what happens.<br /> So I guess I should deduce that citizenship is not a birth right, as many of the anti-immigration hate mongers would like to state over and over again \u201cI am American bc I was born here!\u201d, but a mere ability to purchase your right work in this country and purchase health insurance?<br />Something has to give.  I would say 98% of immigrants out of status in this country are not out of status because they crossed the USA border illegally, they aren\u2019t drug pushers or users, and they are not here to abuse of the system.

Two important concepts applied in the decision process are 1.) First, do no harm, and 2.) because we can does not mean we should.<br /><br />Physicians weigh these very heavily in making decisions about what to offer patients.  Most often those patients receiving heroic or excessive care in the face of inevitable death do so at their own or their families' insistence. Our country loves the story where mountains are moved to sweep in and pull someone back from the brink of death! What we don't look at is the costs, both emotional and economic. We just love the success of it.<br /><br />There are options.  You need to have discussions with your family and loved ones about the circumstances under which you want what done.  Sounds vague, so here are some examples:  For someone who is elderly and develops pneumonia is intubation and time on a vetilator ok? For most, pneumoia is rather easily curable though the time on a ventilator is very difficult. This is an example where extreme measures are used for a brief time to reach a reasonable goal.  Another example: For the same person who has fallen and hit their head, experiencing an accumulation of blood within their brain, where moderate recovery and some loss of previous function likely, is ventilation still ok?  You can choose not to put them on a ventilator and let nature take it's course.  Many physicians will not oppose this, nor will medical ethicist. Last example:  A loved one over the last couple years has become more easily confused, flustered, possibly some personality changes have occurred, and is diagnosed with dementia of a slow progressing type.  When they become ill, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, how much intervention do they or you want?  Treat the infection only? At what point does common treatment seem heroic and futile? And at what point are you ready to let go.<br /><br />Hospice is a growing field, not just in size but knowledge and flexibility.  They understand a lot of the stresses, provide excellent help, often have religious affiliations that provide additional comfort, do often have mission statements that reflect their position on the experience, and are guiding people to accepting when death is a part of life.  But please do not confuse this with euthanasia.

As members of the Texas Respite Coalition, we are trying to untangle the ridiculous quagmire of non-information that families in distress face every day. We have at least started down a path of providing support for the difficult, completely beautiful, totally undervalued and wholly unrecognized role that family care partners play in the American \"system\" of long term services and supports. Kim and Gary's experience, as expressed in her comment on this blog, tells us all we need to know about the need AND the value - yes long term savings! that can result from a relatively modest investment in respite services. In Texas,we have a very small appropriation in the state budget and an even smaller grant from the feds. We really are making some progress with the funds, but Kim and Gary, and all of the other care partners out there, deserve better.The closing sentence of the article in this blog is a call to action - it says  \" With federal assistance, two dozen states have taken tentative steps toward building respite programs for caregivers\". ......We cannot be \"tentative\". We need to take BOLD steps! Thanks to all of you for commenting here. I am moved and motivated by your stories!

It gets twisted by politics, berated by an ignorant public and conned by \"constituents,\" so called health service providers who are only there to rip off patients.  Just read about the \"free\" wheelchairs and the no more than 2-week wait for reimbursements for Medicare treatment, that results in billions of dollars every year in false billings.<br /><br />Make everyone have health insurance, just like you make everyone have car insurance or fire insurance for their homes.  If young people contribute, you can cover the costs of the old people.  If they can't afford it, make it part of welfare.  Get the cities and Feds out of paying for emergency room care.  If someone needs it, the insurance should pay.<br /><br />Insurance companies do a better job of discounting medical and drug bills than the Feds ever could.  My wife had a cancerous kidney removed.  The bill for that alone was $60,000 but the hospital discounted that by more than 50% to the insurance company.  That is the advantage of insurance.  It keeps health care costs sensible.<br /><br />We all believe that we should get something for nothing (not reimburse the doctor because it should be \"part of normal care\"? Where does the cost of \"normal care\" come from?)<br /><br />But, I agree, if you are going to do it, do it as right as you can.  End of life options are important, medically and financially.

Respite is a critical need for families caring for young children and adult children with disabilities and special needs as well as for older adults.  It is the one of the top needs requested by all family caregivers caring for loved ones no matter what the special need is - Alzheimer's Disease, physical disabilities, mental health challenges, medically complex conditions, etc.  Respite is an essential and medically necessary service that improves quality of life for the recipient, prevents abuse and neglect, preserves families, and sustains family caregivers.  This enables them to continue to care for their loved one in the community; thereby preventing, or at least delaying, more costly out of home placement. Although respite is a cost-effective support for families, as states face mounting fiscal challenges, respite is often the first services to be cut because they are optional.  Funding for the LifeSpan Respite Act is crucial to enabling states to build the necessary infrastructure to support families caring for family members.

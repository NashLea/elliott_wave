And in the case of Sarah L., they apparently have viewers who are not aware that the \"fair and balanced\" line is a hoax.  <br/><br/>Mr. Rao also misses the point that releasing a video of Mitt Romney saying things that torpedoed his campaign does not involve lying on Mr. Corn's part; it also ignore the crucial detail that it is O'Reilly who has been caught (yet again) lying outrageously, not David Corn.  David Corn may have his hair on fire for liberalism, but Mitt Romney is still an arrogant fool who shot himself in the foot, and Bill O'Reilly is still a self-aggrandizing, whopper-spinning fraud.

It represents an over-the-cliff proganda position in favor of the right.  Fox is not afraid to repeat completely debunked nonsense about fake scandals like Benghazi in order to keep up the attacks on Democratic politicians, and to pump up it's ill-informed audience's outrage.  Fox is so persistent in repeating obvious non-truths that they are responsible for the charming recent colloquialism, \"zombie lie\", used for lies that just won't die.<br/><br/>Let me also add another reason that the Times does not follow Fox down the rabbit hole:  although making a profit is certainly essential to the New York Times, it is essential to the Times that it do so by actually reporting the news.  Evidently you think that the news business is just a bunch of clowns out to do nothing beyond making a buck, a blundering act of cynicism which is not surprising for a Fox supporter.", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

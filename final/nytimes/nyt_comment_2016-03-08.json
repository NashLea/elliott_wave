Philosophy is not just about asking questions it's about asking questions with a profound commitment to the truth no matter where that truth leads, and in order for anyone to call themselves a philosopher, they must at the very least be acquainted with that which has been common to all Philosophy since Aristotle and that is the method of logically valid  inference. It may very well be that doing this is in fact something that is natural to all people. But if that is the case then it behooves those who believe so to explain why that method is clearly not followed by the vast majority of people.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3448619, "replies": [], "lft": 298, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/philosophys-true-home/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 17818372, "rgt": 299, "userDisplayName": "Econ", "createDate": "1457413398", "userID": 11800525, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1457413449", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Portland", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1457413449", "commentSequence": 17818372, "commentBody": "I think a certain amount of cherry picking is going on here. <br/><br/>To be sure there have been eminent researchers in other disciplines who have been philosophically inclined in their thinking. Soames names some. Whether this was a necessary condition of their contributions is at best unclear (since it does not follow that had they not exhibited philosophical proclivities that they would not have made the contributions they actually did).<br/><br/>In the 20th century at least, philosophers typically had little knowledge of other disciplines (hence the \"cherry picking\"charge). What they did was to use their intelligence to manufacture a priori arguments and theories that bore no relation to empirical research. Not merely that, most of them were openly disparaging of many of the efforts of empirical researchers on grounds of supposed lack of analytical rigor. <br/><br/>Stunningly, the basis of this discounting was an unconditional faith in the epistemological efficacy of their own reflective thought, unaided by the empirical theories of the period. Thought experiments, idiosyncratic analytical intuitions and arguments rooted in\"folk psychology\" or \"common sense physics\" (i.e. that which is accessible from everyday life), etc were the intellectual currency of the day - and that has still not changed that much. To be sure there are some exceptions and as mentioned, Soames identifies a few of these practitioners. <br/><br/>But these still are exceptions - and a priori wheel spinning is not good enough.

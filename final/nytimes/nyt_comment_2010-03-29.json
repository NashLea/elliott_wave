Balancing security with freedom is difficult.  Especially when precedents are few.  One aspect should be that outside the USA, there are rules related to warfare with terrorist groups and what is permitted, especially in coordination with our allies.  In those cases, the laws of the country where the terrorist is living could help guide our choices.  The problem is that we want to capture and get intelligence from terrorists, but other than that would have probably preferred the more expeditious result of death on the \"battlefield\".  However, once a terrorist is brought to USA territory, we'd better have a plan to prosecute in either a military or civilian court. It is not acceptable to hold people indefinitely without charge within our borders.  The problem with the Bush administration is that 1) they believed in torture which is not a reliable means of gathering intelligence; 2) they didn't adequately define how they were going to prosecute the captured terrorists from the start.

And it doesn't matter if the company was Fortune 50 or a Mom 'n Pop with 5 employees.<br /><br />Brand-new straight-out-of-schoolers with no-experience do NOT get put in charge of anything. And 20 or 30 years ago they didn't expect to be put in charge or supervising anyone.  These grandiose ideas are the result of my generation's telling their progeny that they were all Einsteins and #1 at everything!<br /><br />And what did #18 expect? That he would get to sit in the office with a secretary and make decisions about running a business that he knows nothing about? LOL!!!! No business owner with more brain cells than a gnat is going to let him do that.  He really needs to so get over the idea that he is above doing any and all work that a business needs done and the he will never ever actually have to get his hands dirty.<br /><br />A year or so ago, I watched a neighbor of mine when he walked in to one of the stores of his $45,000,000 a year business with 90+ stores.  He just stopped in on a Sunday afternoon with his wife after they had been out to dinner when he realized the store was mobbed and extremely short staffed. He headed back into the beverage cooler and started stocking beer and pop onto the shelves - and stayed at the job for close to 3 hours until it was done. He personally was hauling boxes and and shoving things on the shelves.  And his wife went to the storeroom and began shifting stock to the floor and stocking shelves.<br /><br />If the head of such a business can do that - and he made each of his sons learn the business by doing the daily grunt work - I can assure #18 that he is doing exactly the level of work at which is currently comptent and no one will put him in charge until he learns the business and the company.<br /><br />One can not say that those described in the article are truly 'under-employed.' They are using the skills for which they trained. They may not be getting the money they want and they may not have the size of the operation they want and they may not have as many underlings as they BUT they ARE employed in their fields. \"Under-employed' is the former university porfessor in Switzerland who moved home to the US - and has only found 2 jobs: (a) working in a convenience store stocking shelves and then (b) driving a bus for the regional bus system.<br /><br />Bottom line is too many people have degrees where there simply are not enough jobs needing their fancy skills. The demand for BAs, MAs, MBAs etc is quite finite but the production of people with such degrees vastly exceeds the number of jobs.<br /><br />A whole lot of people - and particularly #13 and #18 - need to downscale their expectations and recognize that they are not as unique and wonderful in the job market as they think they are.<br />", "recommendationCount": 247}, {"assetID": 1307003, "replies": [], "lft": 84, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/us/politics/29force.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1769898, "rgt": 85, "userDisplayName": "georgert", "createDate": "1269833592", "userID": 5550895, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1269837008", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Steamboat Springs, CO", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1269833408", "commentSequence": 38, "commentBody": "As regards targeting individuals for drone strikes, I think that it should be allowed as long as the individuals don't suffer.

There is incredible talent available in this market. You need to focus on the abilities of the person, not what they have done in the past. Most employers are terrified of making hiring decisions and so they protect themselves by listing job requirements. A gutsy boss will look for the fit of the job applicant and the job -- which is much harder than focusing on previous experience. The boss also has to have the self-confidence to hire someone who is as good or better than themselves. Many look for weaker candidates since they are afraid of the competition. When I hear an employer say s/he can't find good candidates, generally one of two things are happening: they aren't paying enough or they can't evaluate the job applicants. It's generally the latter.

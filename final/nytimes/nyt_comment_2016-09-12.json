A 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 score is amazing--one service break per set. I thought we were treated to extraordinary tennis, although I must say, in that first set, the commentators had Pliskova beaten by the fourth game! I found that they did that to many of the players--one might get down by a couple of games, and the commentators would dismiss the player, only to watch that player come back. (What WAS LZ Grandson's expertise in tennis, anyway?) Neither one of those women in that final lost, in my opinion; both were winners. Such exciting tennis. That's why I love it. That's why I continue to play it. Thanks so much to Kerber and Pliskova!

One of the most powerful was to let kids choose their own books.  Visiting the library is a great way to do this, but ownership is even better.  My kids had a very small allowance, but they were allowed a bigger \"book allowance,\" usually spent on books from the order forms their teachers sent home monthly.  It was exciting to pour over the choices each time, and do the math to get as much as they could.  They were not allowed any action figure, movie, or TV books, and there were some other restrictions.  Places that sell second-hand books are more common now, and those would also be great shopping venues.<br/><br/>Another important thing is to allow reading that is \"below\" their leveled books sometimes.  This might include letting kids who are supposed to be reading chapter books read picture books instead.  (Award-winning and other high-quality picture books often have much richer vocabulary and sentence structure, which is good for kids of all ages.)  For beginners and older kids who struggle, rereading is a powerful tool that is not mentioned as often as I think it should be.  Sometimes it can be reading aloud in unison, and other times you can alternate reading pages with your child to spice things up.  Reading poetry especially lends itself to \"choral\" readings.<br/><br/>And keep reading to them!

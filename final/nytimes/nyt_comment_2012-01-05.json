The Taiwanese might feel a little apprehensive about China's arsenal, but no one is worried that China is going to use their nukes.  The issue is less about justifying a relationship based on human rights, and more an issue about whether Iran has nuclear weapons.   I question whether Iran really has a viable nuclear arsenal, despite their claims--but would you want to take a chance on Iran's government acting responsibly with nuclear weapons?  <br/><br/>If Americans want to effect change on the human rights front, then they need to be a lot more concerned about how they spend their money.  Our excessive hunger for oil and cheap imported products keep these repressive regimes in power--not our military industrial complex.

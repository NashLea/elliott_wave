The bison massacres were by white hunters and tourists who even hunted them from trains.  They took the tongues and hides and left the rest to rot until nearly driven to extinction.  Native Americans used every part of the animal to make products.  Mass killing of bisons was part of the overall campaigns to move Native Americans from lands desired by European Americans.<br/><br/>They evolved to survive Western winters by finding forage under the snow that starves cows to death.  They require nothing from humans to thrive in the wild.<br/><br/>As a food animal today, they are ranched and not hunted in the wild.  Owing to their size and ornery dispositions, strong fences are needed and they are not bothered with antibiotics while growing up.  In stores the meat is more expensive than beef, but leaner and, IMHO, a little sweeter.  Nineteenth-century cross-breeding with cows failed, but polluted the gene pool.  This mistake is being gradually reversed.<br/><br/>It is a nascent industry that, while posing no threat to Big Beef, could use some truth in labeling.  Some ground bison packages that come to megamarts have water added, while Whole Foods bulk ground bison does not (obvious difference when browning it).  Some bison is feedlot-finished, some is grass-fed in total, but information is not available.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the bison is a noble beast and this is a great choice.", "recommendationCount": 34}, {"assetID": 3452141, "replies": [], "lft": 11, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/us/politics/bison-mammal-designation.html", "parentID": 18478947, "commentID": 18479077, "rgt": 12, "userDisplayName": "Bonnie", "createDate": "1462852196", "userID": 53877766, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1462852820", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Murphysboro, IL", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1462849220", "commentSequence": 18479077, "commentBody": "No. Over hunting by non-natives, habitat loss to ranches and farms, the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, and a U.

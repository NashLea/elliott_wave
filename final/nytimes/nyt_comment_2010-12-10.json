I spent some time on exchange at a very well known American College and was flabbergasted by the extraordinary difference in the quality of education I received.<br /><br />I do come from relative privilege, yet was expected to work two jobs during the summer time to pay my own tuition up front. I felt like I had a stake in my education and was appalled by the mismanagement and poor teaching at my home institution. In the US I was not just treated like a student but a customer. If I saw a failing they were quick to address it. In the UK am treated as an errant and ungrateful teenager if I raise concerns. As a PG I take issues with this.<br /><br />A good example of the dire state of the system occurred early in my first year at a UK University when I was informed by my subject librarian that the subscriptions for the journals most relevant to my field of study had been cancelled due to a \u00a325M cafeteria building project. Nothing wrong with the old one they just wanted a modern art masterpiece.<br /><br />Such mismanagement would not survive the free market and although this is not a total fix it is a step in the right direction.

There is a class war being waged by the rich and the corporations which is fomented by an international right wing reaction by the wealthy against the middle class.  It is being fought with right wing propaganda that says all nations will suffer a horrible impending financial calamity unless we effectuate their right wing agenda which, among several core principles,  involves drastic entitlement cut backs for the middle class.<br /><br /> Unlike their American peers, the young in the UK understand that they are being made to pay the bill without having eaten the meal. And like most skeptics, they wonder if the doomsday horrors the international right keeps hollering are neigh will really come to pass if there were no middle class cutbacks. Unlike their American peers, these young Brits also ask why they should have to pay for the disastrous conservative economic policies made by a wealthy and powerful ruling class who became incredulously rich from those very policies across the capitalist world.<br /><br />The young who are rioting in Britain are at least asking some basic questions.  One of the most basic questions we all need to ask is where did the right wing get these prescient powers of prognostication that they are able to so accurately predict  doomsday unless we follow their dictates? And then with their prescriptions for economic health,  they slash benefits from the middle class that have taken generations to enact and which are wildly successful.  Why do we so readily cede the bully pulpit to the right wing when so many of the programs they would dismantle are clearly successful and form the backbone of the middle class?<br /><br />All they offer us is, \"Your entitlements cost too much. If we keep spending like this, the nation will collapse. Here's what to do.\"  We get plenty of doomsday scenarios, but no proof. Why should we believe them?

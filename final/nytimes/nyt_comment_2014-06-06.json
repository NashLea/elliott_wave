Calhoun of South Carolina.  Calhoun proposed that states have the right to nullify any federal law they do not like (the Nullification Crisis of 1832). Old Hickory (President Andrew Jackson, also a southerner), became so outraged by Calhoun's actions that he was ready to lead the troops to South Carolina and hang Calhoun (the crisis was defused by Henry Clay and Old Hickory did not hang Calhoun; although, Old Hickory did say on his deathbed that his greatest regret in life was that he didn't hang Calhoun and shoot Clay).<br/><br/>The notion that states can ignore the federal government came to a head in 1860 with the election of Lincoln.  The pro-slave states didn't bother with nullification this time; they simply seceded from the union.<br/><br/>Today, tea party types still think they can nullify federal laws (e.g., trying to shut down the government to nullify the ACA).  One of my state (NE) legislators proposed a bill that would allow Nebraskans to nullify any federal gun-control law (the bill did not make it out of committee).<br/><br/>We fought a Civil War to determine that the federal government is sovereign.  Yet, many citizens still think they can oppose federal laws they do not like (\"Don't Tread on Me\").

Before I even read that quote up there I'd of bet my mangy cat something like this would be the case. And no, it is not that I am so negative, it's because logical deduction makes it so. In economics of any kind, incentives work only for a short time because with market dynamics incentives fall by the way side as other opportunities or down turns arise, leaving those incentives not as incentiveable. In the market system we are always chasing our tails in order to adjust to these market dynamics. And this case is set sure to be a tail chaser. Poor people in an economically unstable region? No way can you trust a market to regulate and government regulation is always and forever going to be a patch job that falls off with the first economic down turn. Good story Andy and I do hope I am wrong, but that quote up there tells the future of the developing world as long as we stick with our current global paradigm.<br/><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703804579383274090741140\" title=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703804579383274090741140\" target=\"_blank\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230470380457938327409...</a>", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3403264, "replies": [], "lft": 843, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/world/asia/bowe-bergdahl-walked-away-before-military-report-says.html", "parentID": 11962085, "commentID": 11964134, "rgt": 844, "userDisplayName": "M McCarthy", "createDate": "1402026900", "userID": 16902594, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1402027560", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1402023960", "commentSequence": 11964134, "commentBody": "No, no and no and they made damn sure their offspring didn't serve either", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Ought the current regime's behavior merit executions as well? That would lead to a cycle of political violence, making reconciliation more difficult for Egypt.<br/><br/>3. Capital punishment is unjust. The idea that any iniquity deserves a pound of flesh is born out of, and encourages, anger and resentment at particular acts committed by the accused.

You're assuming that because the union job has some overtime work that the union employee will work more hours than a \"white\" collar job?  Absolutely untrue.  If you want to keep that white collar job, and especially if you don't want to stay stuck at the entry level responsibility/work forever, you'll need to work 50, 60 or 70 hours per week.  And, you won't get payed any overtime.  That makes it sound like the union job is even better in comparison.  <br/><br/>But here's the thing.  Everywhere you turn in the U.S., there will continue to be enormous downward pressure on most wages because of globalization (i.e., the efficient movement of money and information).  Just enough white collar work is being outsourced to keep a lid on white collar wages.  This will have the effect of exactly what your post implies.  More people will opt for blue collar work by design or necessity.  This will put downward pressure on blue collar wages (even non-factory jobs like plumbing.).  The union salaries are going to get lower and lower over time.  A white collar job is no guarantee.  But the union job is going to have *much* less upside as the world evolves over the next several decades. <br/><br/>We live in a world of 7 billion people.  If you're not willing to work 60 or 70 hours a week, someone else is.  Get used to it.  The U.S. is not special.  There will always be a few high paying jobs.

It is very easy to people to propose all sorts of cuts to the Defense budget of all sorts of percentages. I agree that downsizing of the military is needed but we have to be smart about it.  There are some weapon systems that could be cut and development on others should be halted.  Cuts to people programs should be avoided.  The federal government needs to be smarter about they way they conduct business.   For example, why can't the Social Security Administration, the Civil Service, and Defense Finance Accounting Service use a common data base for reporting death information, deposit information?

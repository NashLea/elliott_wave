He's much more elemental to their game than Arteta was. Who more than Fellaini (maybe Osman, Jagielka and Distin) personifies the Everton style? I wouldn't be surprised if Fergie tried to prise Baines away from Everton. If you recall, that was who I wanted Wenger to get from Everton last year, but we ended up with Arteta from Everton and Andre Santos at left back. Always talk of who is and is not a \"Wenger type\" of player. I think Baines would be an ideal bookend to Sagna on the left. I know it's never going to happen, and its only one match in, but I sure would like to see Dempsey leading the line at the Emirates. At his age, I think he's probably better off a center forward than an attacking mid, and with Arteta and Cazorla creating in MF, and Sagna throwing in crosses, he'd thrive. He's not RVP, but I have a sneaking suspicion he's better than Poldi. I saw some failure to follow plays to their conclusion with Poldi that I did not like, particularly the one where both he and O'Shea overran the ball in the Sunderland half, and Poldi made no move back for the ball. He needs to move-a lot, to prosper as an Arsenal center forward. Hopefully he'll cop on, or AW will pointedly instruct him to.<br/>\nFab will play more, only cause Xavi is a year older, and Iniesta often has knocks. Song? I honestly see him as half time.

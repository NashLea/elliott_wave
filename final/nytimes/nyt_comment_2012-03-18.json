Woodson: \"But I want everybody to know, when it comes to nut-cutting time and I've got a big shot, I'm going to Melo and Amare and guys that have done it.\"  I mean, why phrase the comment in terms of \"guys that have done it\" before?  Or put another way, where did that comment come from?  Sure, it was Woodson who said it, but it sounds like the product of some behind-the-scenes jockeying of jealous players and/or shifty executives.<br/><br/>Novak, and Lin taking the big shots was clearly not appreciated by guys like Anthony who feel like they should be the ones taking those shots; and if they're not taking those shots, they won't play hard.<br/><br/>So what's the real answer as to why D'Antoni left New York?  He couldn't win with players not willing to buy into his system - especially when one of those players is a key piece of the puzzle - and got muscled out.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that the Knicks are still going to lose with their current setup because Anthony is not going to be enough to lead this team to a championship.  A two-win streak over the Blazers and the Pacers is not impressive.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3311737, "replies": [], "lft": 52, "assetURL": "http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/did-history-play-a-role-in-dantonis-departure/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5773185, "rgt": 53, "userDisplayName": "Joey Berlin", "createDate": "1332010872", "userID": 14293459, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1332047445", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "LA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1332043845", "commentSequence": 20, "commentBody": "Have you guys watched the last two games?<br/><br/>My 11-year-old has been chanting \"Fire D'Antoni\" for weeks.

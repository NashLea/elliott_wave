Until a wind energy representative and multiple sustainability professionals write a column in defense of wind energy being an alternative to non-renewable energy sources, I will discontinue reading a paper that hires writers that somehow compare the debate of wind energy towers (an aesthetic issue) to \"fracking.\"<br /><br /> Fracking is a procedure that has the potential to damage one of the cleanest watersheds in the world, and natural gas corporations are exempt from publicly releasing what chemicals are using in this process.   I know Fish is understanding of the injurious effects of franking and derides natural gas corporations, but wind energy and fracking are two different animals.<br /><br />In most cases owners do not have mineral rights, but are paid insubstantial royalties (relative to the amount corporations will receive from extracting the natural gas).  Landowners are given lease-contracts for the land; they OWN the rights to the property.  Additionally, they are not paid a one-time fee, but are given a yearly stipend for allowing this energy source on their land.  Lastly, the Oil and Gas industry only needs to submit a five page permit to apply for natural gas extraction, while the wind energy companies face a 150-page permit that goes through multiple government departments, and faces an 18-month permit process instead of a few months review for O&amp;G permits.<br /><br />As for this paragraph, I nearly launched my mid-day coffee at this bombastic, cliche-ridden, red herring.<br /><br />\"So the wind interests inflict a triple injury \u2014 on the landscape, on the quality of life and on the social fabric of the community \u2014 and then, after a while, they depart, leaving behind what one resident of a turbine-infested town called a \u201cgiant junk yard.\u201d (Yes, I know about decommissioning promises and bonds, but if you think the developers won\u2019t devise several escape hatches when the time comes, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.)\"<br /><br />The injury upon the land due to wind tower construction is limited in comparison to what is being exacted upon Appalachian communities faced with strip mining.  Sadly, our Energy Age is full of trade offs, and while our best energy solution is decreasing consumption.  However, in order to power the grid in a cleaner fashion, wind energy is good alternative in comparison to our current reliance upon coal.<br /><br />Second, quality of life in the United States, according to the Happy Planet Index, is in the bottom tier of the world.  Russia, Iraq, and Israel are ranked above us.  The Happy Planet Index takes into account the triple bottom line measures and ecological footprints.  Quality of life in American communities are all ready at a nadir.  Could wind towers bring us down to Sierra Leone status(We only have 22 descending stairs to compete with the S.L. for 136th place.)?  I don't think so.<br /><br />Lastly, how are you defining community Stanley?  The word is plopped in that paragraph like a piece of bread without butter.  Better brush up on your Wendell Berry speak.  The word \"community\" is not only a cliche word to use in this article, but I have difficulty believing that the social fabric of communities are more fractured by wind energy than coal and natural gas extraction.  Natural gas corporations target low income, rural populations (I'm from southwestern Pennsylvania and have experienced this first hand) that will not resist their mineral-grabbing gusto.  Please (that's you Stanley) see the preview for \"Carbon Nation\" as a counter-documentary to \"Windfall.\"<br /><br />Lastly, the American Wind Energy Association has assessed that 20% of our energy needs could derive from wind turbines.   \"A questionable benefit to the grid,\" I don't think so.<br /><br />Let's choose our battles wisely Stanley.

The larger landowners (farmers in our case) generally were supportive, as the royalties from towers on their land provide a reasonably reliable source of income - which in an industry with notable fluctuations is quite welcome.  The opposition was mostly from homeowners on 5 to 10 acres of land.<br /><br />From what I've seen there are some real concerns - the towers can certainly dominate the view, they are not soundless (but they are not loud - even at 3 a.m., as I found out from a recent excursion to the farm), and the shadow flicker can cause real physical discomfort to those who suffer from motion sickness.  But there are remedies to these issues.  Any given turbine can be shut down within minutes of a phone call to the operating company, so if it is part of the permit agreement that turbines causing flicker be shut down while the shadow passes over a dwelling (typically an hour or so, for a few days a year), then shadow flicker need not cause any problems.  As to the noise - if someone is determined to be upset by it, they will be.  But my ceiling fan is louder than the row of 5 turbines I sat under at 3 a.m.  A passing car easily drowned them out.  Corn rustling in the wind drowns out the turbines.  I've had one of the opposition tell me that his computer's fan drowns them out.<br /><br />One thing I wish we'd done in DeKalb would have been to increase the offset.  We allowed no tower closer than 1400 feet (1/4 mile) to a dwelling.  I'd recommend any community considering a windfarm insist on at least a half mile or more offset.<br /><br />Bottom line for me - wind is a much better alternative to coal and nuclear.

Carefully selected tide gauge data by Simon Holgate of the UK Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory is shown in his poster below, which notes that the rate of sea level rise decelerated in the second half of the 20th century (despite exponential increases in CO2 emissions):<br /><br /><a href=\"http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:FLpL2_mZg8UJ:meteo.lcd.lu/globalwarming/Holgate/sealevel_change_poster_holgate.pdf+holgate+sea+level+rise&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi8_e9k0UqsVba_MaA6nERbHMKhGnbwLfabo6lLahAPjWYAAahVA-LneNc_Oj7DmQKiW3TjIKQ3P2Smi5-uQToIXGF8w0KqIDnC_sCNr1ea7cV1UqetkpIVxrAVmNwXpvnKeP5P&amp;sig=AHIEtbT3rfKGePBNSH6CLz70g-CQQIwHGQ\" target=\"_blank\">http://docs.google.com...</a><br /><br />Furthermore, the rate of sea level rise as determined by satellite altimetry (which is only available since 1992 and is calibrated to tide gauges) has also decelerated over the past 5 years from 3.2 mm/yr to only 1.5 mm/yr, about the same rate as calculated by Holgate for the period 1954-2003. Paleologic data also indicate sea level rise has greatly decelerated over the past 6000 years, and that sea levels have been rising naturally since the last ice age.<br /><br />The long term trend Mark and the \u2018consensus\u2019 would rather you do not consider.<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nOY5jaKJXHM/S509edJYkOI/AAAAAAAAA9w/RJYW0Ojf-NE/s1600-h/Fullscreen\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com...</a>+capture+2282010+65425+<a href=\"PM.jpg\">PM.jpg</a><br /><br />During most of the past 120 million years, sea levels have been 50-100 meters higher than the present. Sea levels dropped ~130 meters below the present during the last ice age and have risen since then throughout the current interglacial, but at a much slower rate over the past 7000 years &amp; had almost no change over the past 2000 years according to paleological studies<br />Sea level varied by over 100 meters during glacial-interglacial cycles as the major ice sheets waxed and waned as a result of changes in summer solar radiation in high northern hemisphere latitudes. Paleo data from corals indicate that sea level was 4 to 6 meters (or more) above present day sea levels during the last interglacial period, about 125,000 years ago. Climate and ice-sheet model simulations indicate that Greenland was about 3\u00b0C warmer than today and that the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets contributed 2.2 to 3.4 metres to the higher sea level, with the majority of the rise coming from the partial melting of the Greenland ice sheet.<br />During the last ice age, sea level fell to more than 120 meters below present day sea level as water was stored in ice sheets in North America (Laurentian, Cordilleran), Greenland, northern Europe (Fennoscandia and the Barents region) and Antarctica. As the ice melted, starting around 20 000 years ago, sea level rose rapidly at average rates of about 10 mm per year (1 m per century), and with peak rates of the order of 40 mm per year (4 m per century), until about 6000 years ago when they started to level off.<br />The last few thousand years<br />Sea level rose much more slowly over the past 7,000 years. The sea level 2,000 years ago can be deduced by (for example) examining fish tanks built by the ancient Romans. Because the tanks had to be at sea level for the sluice gates to function, we can precisely estimate sea level during the period of their use. Comparison of this level with historical records indicates that there has been little net change in sea level over the past 2000-6000 years.<br />A number of other data types are used to estimate sea level over preceding ages. Some of them are:<br />\u2022\tGeological - e.g. raised beaches, wave-cut shelves, transgressive sequences<br />\u2022\tBiological - e.g. shells, tree stumps, corals, salt marshes<br />\u2022\tMan-made - e.g. Ancient Roman fish tanks, Crusader wells in the Palestine, middens<br />\u2022\tRelated: Penn professor Bob Giegengack, PhD Geologist:<br /><br />\"Sea level is rising,\" Giegengack agrees, switching off the sound. But, he explains, it's been rising ever since warming set in 18,000 years ago. The rate of rise has been pretty slow \u2014 only about 400 feet so far. And recently \u2014 meaning in the thousands of years \u2014 the rate has slowed even more. The Earth's global ocean level is only going up 1.8 millimeters per year. That's less than the thickness of one nickel. For the catastrophe of flooded cities and millions of refugees that Gore envisions, sea levels would have to rise about 20 feet.<br /><br />\"At the present rate of sea-level rise,\" Gieg says, \"it's going to take 3,500 years to get up there. So if for some reason this warming process that melts ice is cutting loose and accelerating, sea level doesn't know it.

When hyperbole of this magnitude is employed editorially, I always ask myself who would really be motivated to tell lies on such a scale. Is it convenient that natural gas is also vilified to give the appearance that the fossil fuel industry is not the one motivated to push back against alternative energy development in this country. But I know firsthand what the wind energy developers do in working to negotiate land leases for projects (especially verses what went on for years in oil and gas leasing in this country). My experience is nothing like what Stanley Fish depicts in this dishonest rendering of manipulation and deceit by bullying wind energy development companies. There is a significant political push back against wind development by big oil in this country and resources there that dwarf anything in wind. I will simply say this article is a hack job and I suggest anyone who doubts me to go find a community where there is wind development and find out for them selves what the truth is. Stand next to a 3 megawatt Vestas V-90 turbine in the wind and listen to the noise it produces. Find a neighbor who is willing to discuss his deal on a lease and find out just how unreasonable the economic metrics of a wind farm lease may or may not be. Look at the actual impact of a single megawatt turbine on the grid, and then ask what 300 megawatts mean to a county or even a city. Ask yourself if you want coal, and gas, and hydrocarbon emissions, or the alternative of nuclear power generation, instead of wind towers to keep the lights on for your children's children.

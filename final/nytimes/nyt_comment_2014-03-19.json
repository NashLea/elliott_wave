Scientific production is not economic.  It is, however, essential for the later existence of technological invention and consequent economic production.  For instance, the reported discovery of gravitational waves from the Big Bang is a kind of production that reaps no economic rewards and has no effect on prosperity.

It can be made not-an-assault-weapon by filing the lug off which will make it much safer because criminals and terrorists cannot use it for bayonet charges. They can however tie a knife to a stick.

I was OnLine here - when she was en route to NWR - and I was trying to find bus and rail means to get her to her destination where no planes were flying. In the end, the only solution was to be driven and then to drive a rental car. You cannot imagine how absurd this seems to me an American living in Sweden where there is a complete and highly efficient system of public transport.<br/>Larry"}]}, "lft": 32, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/opinion/friedman-from-putin-a-blessing-in-disguise.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11370594, "rgt": 35, "userDisplayName": "Look Ahead", "createDate": "1395203179", "userID": 18426496, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1395203227", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "WA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1395215533", "commentSequence": 11370594, "commentBody": "The US has a huge opportunity to move from the back seat to the drivers seat of the global energy bus, replacing some truly undesirable oligarchs in Russia, the Middle East, Venezuela and elsewhere. <br/><br/>We currently consume about twice the MPG as the global auto fleet. We have less rail, and virtually no high speed rail, compared to other major economies. Our home heating is far less efficient than the rest of the planet.<br/><br/>This might appear to be a big problem but the good news is that the technology already is in use almost everywhere else. That's why President Obama was able to gain agreement with the Big Three automakers to double CAFE standards by 2025. Other conversions are needed as well, in mass transit, home heating and lighting.<br/><br/>The truth is that the US could cut fossil fuel energy consumption dramatically without lifestyle tradeoffs with current technology. <br/><br/>But if we can't even figure out how to replace 100 watt light bulbs with halogen 72 watt bulbs (not CFLs) that produce the same light output and quality without a huge political backlash, I believe the energy oligarchs will be driving the bus for the foreseeable future.

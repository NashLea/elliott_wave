What should concern Americans and anyone that values a stable society, is if the poor REMAIN poor. For example, if you just arrived in the US with no education and skills, you'll likely be poor. But if our system provides access to education and is fair about employment, we'd hope to find that you or your children are not poor 30-40 years on. That is the definition of upward mobility.

Look it up. Benzene is traditionally producedby distillation of coal tar.

There are several of them nasty enough that I wouldn't want them in my soup. <br/><br/>The State Department has it right in this instance. A pipeline which (occasionally, among other things) handles dilbit is no more (and admittedly no less) of a risk to the public than a conventional crude oil line. <br/><br/>And the pressure?

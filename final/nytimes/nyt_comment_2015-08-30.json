The importance of cholesterol for heart disease cannot be overstated, although there are, of course, other factors that also modify the risk.  However, the correlation of cholesterol and myocardial infarction is very tight on the population level.  Ditto for saturated fat by the way.  What you may be mixing up is that saturated fat primarily affects cholesterol levels when there is also a dietary source of cholesterol.  A vegetarian who does not take up dietary cholesterol is not at high risk from saturated fat.  Someone on a Paleo diet on the other hand is at greatly increased risk, so is someone on a high dairy diet.<br/>Finally, elevated cholesterol levels are lifetime (!), not acute, risk.  The facts are simple: Anything that drives cholesterol into the vascular wall will increase atherosclerosis and hence MI and stroke risk.  That includes smoking, high blood pressure and, of course, high LDL levels. The smaller the LDL particles, the easier for them to find access to the vascular wall through endothelial gaps. In that respect, atherosclerosis is really not too different from a drainage pipe.  The more sticky gunk you pour into the sink, the more likely it is to clog.<br/><br/>Anyway, anyone reading your \"advice\" should know that they follow it at their own risk of avoidable cardiovascular death.

Myths always have at least a kernel of truth, but you need the rest of the story.<br/>\nMyth 1. Fracking is a 60-year-old, safe, well proven technology. Yes, fracking is 60 years old. But using this shorthand obscures the truth that what\u2019s at issue here isn\u2019t really just fracking. It's the entire process of coaxing gas from shale using high-volume, slickwater fracking with long laterals (well bore drilled vertically then horizontally) from clustered, multi-well pads. Used together, they form a new process, having been introduced about five six years ago, the jury is still very much out on its safety.<br/>\nMyth 2. Fluid migration from faulty wells is rare.<br/>\nNot true. For example, industry researchers examined 352,000 Canadian wells and found sustained casing pressure and gas migration - about 12 per cent of newer wells leaked, considerably more than older wells.<br/>\nMyth 3. The use of clustered drilling pads reduces surface impacts.  False, such pads are large and growing, 10-50 acres or more. and will leave behind clusters of wellheads/holding tanks for decades.<br/>\nMyth 4. Natural gas is a \u201cclean\u201d fossil fuel<br/>\nNew evidence here is discouraging. NASA scientist D. Shindell\u2019s work shows that methane is 105 times more powerful than CO2 as a global warming contributor over a 20-year time horizon.  Leaks happen routinely during regular drilling, fracking and flowback operations.\"", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 3327088, "replies": [], "lft": 19, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/searching-for-a-new-economy/", "parentID": 6481258, "commentID": 6484632, "rgt": 20, "userDisplayName": "Ruppert", "createDate": "1340495777", "userID": 63067703, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1340513289", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Germany", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1340509689", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "You avoid to say \"fracking\", the dirty word.

They get a cold breakfast with no tea and at best a luke-warm supper congealing after it was cooked some hours before. <br/><br/>In Nepal, this would mean a long day's hard labor at high altitudes without a hot meal or a hot drink. <br/><br/>Would you live this life yourself?

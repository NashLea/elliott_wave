As a result, we get reviews (and interminable, yet often inconclusive, reviews at that) in every sport - baseball, football, basketball, etc. Even if the ultimate placement of the ball is basically arbitrary in American football, there's a sense in which Americans aspire to a game in which referee discretion and, more importantly, referee mistakes, cannot influence the outcome of the game. I'm not making a normative statement one way or the other, as I actually prefer the vagaries that arise in the run of play (although Edu's non-goal was a travesty, as was Lampard's, as was Tevez's goal against Mexico), but the typical American fan will not put up with a shrug of the shoulders from FIFA officials when it comes to clearly unjust outcomes.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2561207, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/us/25lobby.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3592190, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "Sue Tarjan", "createDate": "1301026198", "userID": 63363797, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1301026653", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Santa Cruz, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1301023053", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "If the nuclear industry wants to build more nuclear plants, let it do so without government loan guarantees and taxpayer-paid disaster insurance.

The corporate income tax is a tax that harms profitable mid-size or small companies.  Obviously the truly powerful businesses already do not pay it.  A company is a group of people serving a market need and performing work.  This is not something we want to discourage.  GE is not evil.  America is far stronger for having a wonderful company like GE here.  The alternative is we all live in caves and eat dirt.  It is anti-intellectual to suggest life without large corporations is really good.  We know nothing of that.  Large corporations are highly efficient human work and human service units.  They provide us some of our most cherished achievements and possessions.  <br/><br/>My salient point is, if you want to tax the powerful PEOPLE in this land, you can do so.  Bump the capital gains taxes higher -- such as those over 1 million dollars.  I suggest a 40% rate (let's not get too out of hand).  With the massive boost in revenue under control, we should cut the corporate tax on small businesses.  It is possible to collect taxes without this cartoonish focus on corporations.  No person can use corporate wealth unless he or she pays income tax on it.  So, we need not tax the corporate wealth.  It is a knee jerk reaction that sounds good, but is actually totally counter-productive.  GE actually becomes stronger because it can invest whereas a smaller firm must pay the tax, so they cannot achieve the same performance, and cannot win bids against GE.

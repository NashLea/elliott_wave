This isn't to say high levels of CO2 haven't affected sea life historically, the problem we have today is the shift in acidity or PH is happening at such a fast rate life can't adjust. The CO2 levels have pushed the acidity of the Ocean to a level where the shells required by larval (baby) marine life is dissolving. This means that the bottom of the Ocean's food chain is dying. Off our coast, there is a small snail that makes up 50% of a juvenile salmon's food intake. These snails swim up over 300 feet to feed at the surface at night. Because the CO2 levels have risen so rapidly the effect of the CO2 acidification is concentrated in the top layer of the Ocean, most marine life is in the top 150 feet. When the shells of these snails dissolves they die and with that the salmon's food disappears. <br/><br/>I've illustrated a single case for salmon unless we reverse the CO2 levels the food chain of the entire Ocean will collapse.

So when this \"bet\" tanked, which it did 100%, the University was left without any cash to fund its basic operations. It suffered the first round of strategic layoffs I believe in its history, had to ditch the Allston plan, and day to day operations suffered significantly.<br/><br/>The one comment I recall came from Stanford's main investment officer. She said she had never sen anyone take a risk like that before. I believe she said (or maybe this is my creative interpretation), that he gambled their lunch money, Sadly, Harvard went hungry for quite some time. There is still a gaping hole in the ground across the Charles River from the main campus and a lot of animosity on the part of that city's residents towards its non-tax paying neighbor.<br/><br/>Reckless, irresponsible, stubborn and tone deaf are all words I would associate with Lawrence Summers.

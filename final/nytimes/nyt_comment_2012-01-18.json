That in itself would give President Obama 4 more years with a Gingrich nominee. Gingrich never mentioned our enemy, facing a Christian crowd; one can be assured it was the Islamic terrorist that he was targeting. Gingrich knows (the military acknowledges) all radical Muslim terrorist cannot be killed...he also knows that there are more to take their place.<br/><br/>\"We kill our enemies\"...with all due respect to President Bush...was tried with 2 prolonged wars...it is time to stop. <br/><br/>Make no mistake, Gingrich is first and foremost a career politician. He knows the buttons to push...he did it in last night debate, which was not so much a debate, as a ramble rouser with a hawker turning on the crowd.<br/><br/>Mitt Romney must have felt uncomfortable...not his way of articulating issues...not part of the Washington political circle and their ways of getting re-elected.<br/><br/>Ronald Reagan, the Gingrich mentor, faced a huge...enemy...the Soviet Union, using a buildup of our military and a rigid diplomacy effort, the Soviet Union collapsed. Reagan never threatened to kill any Russians.<br/><br/>So the people at Fox News thought Gingrich won the debate...preaching hate and division....sounds not much different than the Obama machine.

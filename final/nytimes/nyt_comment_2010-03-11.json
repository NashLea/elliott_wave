The Western press, allegedly in the thrall of the \"Israel Lobby\" rarely mentions that the Palestinians turned down exceptionally fair and reasonable offers by Barak at Taba and Olmert.  I  ask other commentators to this series of articles to identify a single statement by Abbas expressing suport for the existence of a Jewish state existing alongside a Palestinian state.  For Abbas, Erekat and most PA leaders, the two-state solution includes a recognition of the Palestinians right of return,  i.e., two Palestinian states.  For Palestinians all of Israel is occcupied terrirtory.<br />  In the coming days, Israelis will witness another \"confidence building measure.\"  The PA is accelerating its decision to name a Ramallah square in honor of Dalal Mughrabi, a Fatah leader who, on March 11, 1978, protesting the Sadat-Begin peace negotiations, led a quad of Palestinians on the Israel Coastal Road and killed 38 people including 13 children, many of whom were burned alive in the bus.in which they were riding.  The celebration of the martyrdom of Mughrabi signals many Israelis that Palestinian leaders, by honoring her act, have never existed the presence of a Jewish state in the region.  Indeed, most Palestinian leaders refuse to even acknowledge the unbroken three thousand year Jewish presence in Jerusalem.what is now Israel  Israelis, however, are even more saddened by the silence of the American government in the face of such celebrations.  When America's silence is combined with what is clear American polkicy to accept the existence of a nuclear weaponized Iran, it is no wonder that confidence Israelis have in our President is dismally low.   Note also that in his much-lauded Cairo speech, the President said not one word about Sadat and rewrote history by ignoring Jews' presence for centuries in the Holy Land, treating the presence of Jews as a migration of recent vintage as recompense for the Holocaust -- the same narrative extolled in Muslim lands.<br />  Israeli is not without blame, but, the willingness of the vast majority (though not all) Israelis to accept the existence of a Palestinian state adjacent to Israel led by those who accept a Jewish state stands in marked contrast to the irridentist policies followed by Palestinian leaders.

Interestingly enough, the only country in the MIddle East that has a growing Christian population is Israel - the sad fact is that the Muslim countries are driving the Christians out in much the same way that they are driving them out of Arab (note that I used the ethnic term \"Arab\" and not the religious term, \"Muslim\") parts of East Jerusalem.<br /><br />Please further note that during the 130 years, we've seen all too clearly how Christians protect Jews:<br /><br />1) Endless pogroms (government organized and condoned riots and attacks on Jews) in Tsarist Russia, culminating in an official government policy under Alexander II to solve its \"Jewish problem\" by converting a third, killing a third (either through pogroms or by putting 10 year old boys in army) and get the remaining third to leave;<br /><br />2) The Dreyfus Affair in France (in which the highest ranking Jewish officer in the French Army was framed with fraudulent evidence in a court-martial, concealing the real culprit, a German spy embedded in the French Army.  The result was  national outbreaks of anti-Jewish riots;<br /><br />3) The infamous \"blood libel\" in Damascus, in which Jews were accused of using the blood of Muslim children to make matzo;<br /><br />4) Anti-Jewish riots throughout the Ottoman Empire, especially in Jerusalem and Hebron, during the 1920s and 1930s, in which the British turned the other cheek and did nothing;<br /><br />5) The Holocaust, in which Christians in Germany initiated the attempted extermination of Jews worldwide, and were assisted by Christians in Poland, France, Holland, Austria...  Those very same Christians were the folks who implemented the White Paper and otherwise blocked Jewish escapes to the Holy Land, the USA and just about every other country besides Costa Rica.<br /><br />The point is that Jews cannot rely on anyone else to protect them, and they need a place to escape to in times of dire need.<br /><br />Turning to the issue of G-d granting the land to the Jews, please consult what you refer to as the \"Old Testament.\"  Any reading of it, no matter how archaic or conservative, makes it clear that the land on which Israel, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and arguably some parts of Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, were given to the Jewish people by G-d.<br /><br />Denying that right undermines the entire Messianic Concept upon which Christianity is based, and once humans of today deny parts of the Bible based upon their \"modern science, judgements and concepts,\" where does that denial end?<br /><br />Here's the bottom line problem that you are missing: its not about Israel, its about Jews --- Jews need a country of their own as much as the Irish need Ireland, Tibetans need Tibet and the Kurds need a new \"Kurdistan.\"  In fact, every ethnic and religious group needs one for safety.  Look what the British did to the Irish, the Chinese are doing to Tibetans and Iraq did to the Kurds (with pressure from the Turks, too).<br /><br />Why should those groups have or deserve their own country if Jews are not allowed one, too?<br /><br />As for Harry Truman, all he did was make the USA the first country to recognize the UN-created new country of Israel in 1948 - the next day, he imposed an arms embargo, denying Israel military supplies it desperately needed to fend off the simultaneous attacks from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the Kingdom of Transjordan, Egypt, etc.<br /><br />You also need to know that if this is about religion, as most will concede under pressure, then the simple fact that the Muslims denied all Jews - not just Israelis, but ALL Jews - access to Jerusalem from 1948-67 proves that Islamic-dominated governments cannot be trusted to safeguard equal access for all faiths.  And, if you check the armistice agreement of 1948, you'll find that \"access to all holy sites for all faiths (was) guaranteed.\"<br /><br />Most Jews and most Israelis would gladly trade land for REAL peace; the problem is that they do not trust the so-called Palestinians.  Remember: the Israelis evacuated Lebanon and all they got in return was kidnappings, rocket and mortar attacks and eventually, an intolerable situation that ended in war.  Remember: Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip and left warehouses, greenhouses and resorts intact for use by the Palestinians - who destroyed them for no reason - and was again \"thanked\" with rockets, mortars, kidnappings and murders, which led to the War nearly 14 months ago.<br /><br />It is about trust, and I cannot blame the Israelis for being fearful.  Jews trusted \"modern, civilized, democratic Europe\" in the 1930s and 40s, and look what happened.<br /><br />Israel is the size of New Jersey, and half of its is desert.

Racism, America's Original Sin, is never far below the surface in too many individuals.  However, on an institutional level, I believe it's closely tied to class warfare.  Since the conservative movement's attack on the New Deal gathered steam three decades ago the super-rich have been seizing back what they believe is rightfully theirs at the expense of people who used to work for a decent living.   Capital-friendly trade and tax policies drained the heart and tax-base from communities as factories closed, jobs were exported or eliminated and families stripped of their livelihoods.  This is the modern-day oppression, and it is really what's behind the Detroit bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, Big Capital's political servants and their mouthpieces like Hannity and Limbaugh fan the flames of racism to pit working people (actual or would-be) against each other.  <br/><br/>Detroit and Sanford are closer than you think.

Obviously it will take more than that amount to get Detroit back on its feet, but it is important to keep in the mind that we have the financial wherewithal to reinvigorate Detroit if we really want to. <br/><br/>Another key to reinvigorating Detroit is to restore some population density, and the economic activity that goes with it.

Let undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal records and are already in the U.S. be free of fear of deportation if they move to Detroit.  And for people who want to immigrate to the U.S., create an expedited system that ensures quick approval for any law-abiding immigrant who agrees to live in Detroit for at least five years. <br/><br/>A second way to increase density is urban homesteading. The city government in Detroit has taken possession of tens of thousands of vacant lots and thousands of other lots in the city have long been abandoned.

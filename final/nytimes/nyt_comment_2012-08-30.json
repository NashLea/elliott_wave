The only thing I have seen  him in is Brokeback, and he was pretty good in that.  I must admit, I don't see too many movies.  I do see ALOT of theatre.  I found him to be very charming and intriguing on stage!  He is also believable and gives a really, really wonderful performance.  The girl who plays his niece also gives a wonderful, brave performance.  He name is Anne Funke.  The other two actors are very competent as well. The problem is the play is an utter mess. I may not always like a play but I can get into it. When I am really bored, I know there is a problem. What bigger gauge is there? I was pretty bored during most of this. There is some very clever technical wizardry going on. I almost don't want to give it away.  Let's just say they are sloshing around in water for the last quarter of the play as well as their curtain call. Jake could have picked ANY play he wanted to and it would have been produced.  I have no idea what he saw in this play. This is just a boring, uninteresting study of four dysfunctional people. Nothing new, nothing we haven't seen before done better. But I say Bravo to Jake! And Bravo to Anne Funke.  I look forward to seeing him again on stage in a better play.

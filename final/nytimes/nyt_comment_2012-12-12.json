Also unsaid, but has been suggested, is that Maradona, in his unhinged state, *chose willfully* to play Messi in what was not his optimal position so as to not be eclipsed as the best player Argentina ever produced. Witness his sniping at Pele as a sign of Maradona's basic insecurity, and the idea doesn't seem so far fetched.<br/>\nNow there is no excuse for Argentina to not build around Messi, and being in Brazil might just bring out the best in not only Messi, but in all of the Albicelestes.

I went to a Wednesday night game against the Phils that was the last game of the season pitched by Matt Marvey, who went seven strong, and the only hit he gave up was an HR leading off the game by Jimmy Rollins. There were 3000 people in the stands, TOPS, and a disturbing proportion of them were in Phillies' garb. I went to the last home game of the season, a Wednesday DAY game after school was back in session. It was the day Dickey won his 20th against the Pirates. There were at LEAST 25,000 in the stands, and few were in Pirates' gear.<br/>\nIf the Wilpons can't do the math on putting fannies in the seats, then they're somehow even stupider than I had imagined, which is hard to even conceptualize. David Wright played, and homered, in both games. I know it was *an occasion,* but Dickey was responsible, I'd say, for putting at least 20,000 fannies in the seats on this day. At an average price of $25/ticket, which I consider conservative, the additional take for the Mets on tickets ALONE was half a million dollars, not to mention parking and concessions. Multiply that by 16 home starts for Dickey, and the Mets should be able to make $8-10 million per season on the days that Dickey starts over any other starter (even Johan). Hello? Anybody home?

How to persevere without your best stuff (his 20th win last year was a perfect example-fell behind with a poor knuckler. Got guys out with fastballs, changeups, and an occasional curve, and won on a Wright three run dinger), and how to prepare professionally. He bunt, he hits, he fields as well as any pitcher in the game. Why would the Mets NOT find all of those important blocks to build upon?

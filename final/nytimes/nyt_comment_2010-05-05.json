Most of those who object to these sorts of questions have used the argument that you wouldn't get asked that question in a job interview.<br /><br />These are background discussions, feeling-out sessions. These are men who are lining up for massive payday without having been on the field for a single NFL snap.<br /><br />These are men who, too often, bring baggage with them. Certainly we applaud those who overcome their baggage, but let's please be honest: If you have a world of talent (YES, GOD-GIVEN), almost anything about you will be overlooked by those who want to leverage that talent for their own aims. You ARE a commodity and you ACCEPT those terms, because you want the BIG PAYDAY.<br /><br />So now you're in this room talking to a man who has to decide if he is going to make you rich, without ever having seen you play as a pro. Now your entitled life comes face to face with a world of zero excuses and zero acceptance of failure. Now you are face to face with the top level, men as talented as you and maybe more. Now is when the free ride ends.<br /><br />And as we have clearly learned, these men are not always ready for that transition. So much money - why drive drunk? So much money - why carry a gun? So much money - why consort with drug dealers and prostitutes? So much money - why kill dogs?<br /><br />I understand that it's distasteful, but are we infants here? We can tolerate distasteful. We do it every day. Some stuff just has to be done, and we don't have to like it.<br /><br />Is the argument that the pampering must continue? Haven't we all at one time or another railed against pampering?<br /><br />I have little use for the argument that players are being disrespected by tough questions. (a) So what? Is disrespect a crime? A GM has to report to his owner whether or not this man deserves guaranteed millions. He should worry that a question may make the player feel disrespected? So, no questions which might hurt the young man's feelings? This cannot be a serious argument. (b) What is disrespectful about exploring the man's background? If the very act of doing so is on its face disrespectful, then you tie a team's hands behind its back. Now, due diligence is disrespect? We turn the process on its head?<br /><br />And again, why? To sustain the sense of entitlement? To keep playing the \"don't know don't tell\" game so we can have this commodity on our team?<br /><br />And of course that used to be the case. Turn a blind eye and all that. And then one player after another embarrassed the league, his team, himself and his family. And suddenly \"character\" became, for many teams, the most important asset of a player.<br /><br />And that is each team's choice. Perhaps Ireland should have simply declined to interview Bryant, or perhaps Ireland wanted to know more about the man and how he had overcome his baggage. I don't know and nobody else knows what it takes to get a feeling about the maturation process of another person. The best any of us can do is try to get to know some things about the person and see how we feel about it.<br /><br />It is an unavoidably imperfect process, and we're all just doing the best we can.

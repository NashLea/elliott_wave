I smoked for over 30 years, and had family nag me for almost the same amount of time to quit.  I had tried quitting cold turkey, using patches, using gum, using Chantix.  I could never quit for more than 26-36 hours before the cravings got so bad that I went back to smoking.  Back around 2009, I had tried e-cigs and hated it.  It really wasn't like smoking and inhaling through a chunk of saturated material was just too hard.  Since then, the technology advanced by leaps and bounds.  In just a few short years, vaporizer technology went from the equivalent of the Model T to a modern car with a biturbo engine with climate control, navigation, cruise control and collision avoidance.  I decided to give vaping another try.  On January 6, 2015 I smoked my last cigarette and started vaping.  For the first few weeks, I vaped a lot.  Every time I felt the craving for a cigarette, I picked up my vaporizer.  It will be 14 months next week since I started vaping and I have not had a single cigarette in all that time.  Every once in a while I will still think about cigarettes, but then my vaporizer is there and after a few puffs the thought goes away.  One clue that I am winning the battle with smoking is that now I can go much longer without vaping than I could without smoking.

NPR is the only news organization remaining that has no significant bias (at least not since Tomlinson, the conservative chairman of the CPB, resigned in 2005) and is dedicated to in depth news coverage. As we have seen recently, unbiased in-depth news coverage and facts are antithetical to the emerging conservative party, which relies on propaganda and ignorance to get people to hew to its ideology (take the issue of global warming or WMD in Iraq as perfect examples). Plus, the less competition Fox has, the better for its bottom line.<br /><br />Look, what Mr Williams said may be how he genuinely felt, and he has every right to say it....but they didn't paint a very flattering picture of his feelings toward muslims (even if lots of Americans agree). And since he was an employee of NPR, his views reflect poorly on NPR as a whole (can we really trust what Mr Williams says now when he reports about muslims?), so they have every right to fire him. I don't necessarily agree with the decision, and maybe one could make the argument that we would rather have peoples' biases out in the open than closeted, at least then we know in what context to put their stories. But this is a very gray area, and there were clearly a lot of other issues at play in the decision: for example the NPR ombudsman has received numerous complaints about Mr Williams' appearances on Fox over the years, not just this one.<br /><br />Finally, what would Mr Williams say if another journalist had made similar remarks about being scared to sit by a black man on a bus?

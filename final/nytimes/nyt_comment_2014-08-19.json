Perhaps if Johnston had done is homework, he would have found an evaluation system that values teachers and the job they do without the loss of due process.  Under PAR teachers are either fired, leave on their own accord, or are given an extra year of staff development.   It is a good way to separate the good from the bad, but many districts can't use it because RTTT funding is solely based on evaluating teachers using test scores.  Montgomery County decided they wanted to keep their evaluation system and therefore didn't receive any government funding.  Montgomery County was the first to call for a moratorium on high-stakes testing until the Common Core could be implemented correctly.  Now that seems to be the call around the Nation.<br/>Tenure does not protect teachers from yelling at their principals.  That's insubordination and leads to dismissal.

Two Boys was fantastic, and the only interesting, daring opera on the season last year. And the hall was packed with the youngest audience I've ever seen at the Met. I've heard the classics, I want to hear something new and be challenged as a smart listener and viewer. I don't want frivolous entertainment. My criticism is that the Met doesn't do MORE new works and MORE new productions--that's the stuff that keeps opera interesting. And thanks to the unions for deciding that their high salaries are worth more than the music and productions for audiences, I'm doubtful the Met will want to take the risk. The musicians barely took cuts...3.5%?! That basically means they don't get a raise in the next four years. What a negotiation, particularly for the highest paid musicians in the industry. (Who are paid a lot more than most of the administration, just fyi. The administration is more than just Peter Gelb.) Thanks, but I'll go support all the amazingly talented musicians who play at places like Roulette, BAM, the Kitchen, the Stone, and other interesting venues, who clearly put art above money-making. And no, higher salary does not equal higher quality, definitely not here in NYC.

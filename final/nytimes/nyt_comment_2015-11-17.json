It's easy to be sitting at home and thinking about all of the idealistically correct things France should do, but Hollande is running the reality of the situation and he's taking the steps he sees necessary.  He's the leader, we're not.  <br/><br/>I wish all of the leaders of all civilized countries would unite and get on a stage together declaring that they are going to work together to defeat ISIS.  Until that happens, ISIS will hang in there and most likely continue to grow despite the efforts of any one nation.  <br/><br/>Quite frankly, I think the only reason the West hasn't taken a more bold approach in uniting immediately (militarily speaking) after the Paris attacks is because of the disaster of the Iraq war.  Everyone has cold feet, and the world doesn't trust the west in the same way it did pre-Iraq war.  Even the west doesn't trust itself in the same way.  The Paris attacks were an act of war.  France is at war.  War isn't pretty.  I hope all nations against terrorism can unite.  If not, what will it take to do so?  A worse attack?

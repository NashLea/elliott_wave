More people came to streets after police had beaten totally peaceful pro-EU protesters, most of which were students. People stayed on streets because no guilty of beating peaceful students was found. The President signed the laws that allowed to jail for 2 or 15 years any peaceful anti-goverment protester. And policemen started to imprison people on streets. Only then people started fighting. They didn't fight with guns or bombs, but police shoot four people. One man was taken to forest, bound and left to die. Yesterday his body was given back his family. And people still don't shoot, don't rob markets and shops, don't kill pro-goverment supporters. They either stand on meetings or fight with police. So are we really so wild and anti-democtatic?

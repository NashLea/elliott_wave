It is only since the mid-1980's, and the watershed influence of Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan, that America has embraced the idea that business should devote itself simply and solely to profit-making.  Previously, the consensus view was that business needed to balance its drive to make a profit with a recognition of its social responsibilities.  As a result, companies rarely relocated just because profit might be enlarged elsewhere, nor did they even think about outsourcing jobs to India or elsewhere.  Instead, they operated under the belief that they had certain compelling moral obligations including, first and foremost, to (try hard to) provide stable, lasting employment to their workers and communities.<br /><br />That sounds rather quaint today.  Yet the decades during which that conception of business prevailed marked the period during which America became the world's dominant economic power.  In other words, that version of capitalism - one in which businesses pursued both profit and (certain) social objectives as well - worked quite successfully.  Most of our business forbears would be quite surprised, therefore, to hear today's apologists argue that a commitment to social responsibility has no place in business.  To a degree, at least, today's social entrepreneurs are simply re-embracing a conception of capitalism that long held sway.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2016012, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/fear-of-profit/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2765737, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "joyce", "createDate": "1288482624", "userID": 23699292, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1288498824", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new brunswick, canada", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1288495224", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "A healthy society has hundreds and hundreds of small businesses in varying stages of growth.

I must admit that we spent a lot of our time looking at several hotels within Istanbul, but finally settled on this one for overall value for money and location - and that is exactly what we got and more!<br /><br />The hotel is located in a local part of the Sultanahmet district, and all famous tourist attractions are within 5-10 minutes walk away. Amenities and towels are supplied, so no need to lug extra stuff with you!<br /><br />Staff were very nice and friendly, especially front desk Erhan (?) and the two young men we saw every day before setting out. They helped us with almost everything such as suggesting places to visit, restaurants, directions, and transport etc.<br /><br />Breakfast was also very nice, in fact, my friend looked forward to having breakfast at Art City every morning!<br /><br />If I had to fault the hotel then it would be that the street is noisy and if you leave the windows open you are bound to hear the locals talking, and loudly! As we were staying for a long weekend, the other guests in the hotel also seemed a little 'merrier' than preferred but I'd say that's the effects of alcohol more than anything!<br /><br />I would also recommend booking a transfer of some sort to get you to the hotel because it isn't that easy to find for first timers! It's not on a main road and to get to it without a map or knowledge of street names etc would be a nightmare! The hotel provides a complimentary airport shuttle service but this is only free for those who booked through their website.<br /><br />We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Istanbul and I feel thatMillennium Suites   contributed to the wonderful experience, so thank you! And yes, I would definitely recommend this hotel to people.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing, there are lots of stairs and hills in Istanbul, and though  Millennium Suites  isn't located on one (it's sort of in the middle?), you will come probably come across a hill or two on your strolls, so be warned!

Whether a post-surgery decision, responding to a forclosure notice, or a telephone request for personal checking account information from strangers, the competent friend or relative of the Alzheimer's-afflicted person has to be aware of such possible events and take the initiative. On the one hand, an existing durable power of attorney, created without a sacrifice of a person's pride, may already be in place and require, when needed, a doctor's examination of the patient, tests and a medical certification for someone to assume the responsibility of attorney-in-fact. On the other hand, if there is no durable power of attorney, living trust, or conservatorship in place, the patient is \"totally at risk\" to declining cognitive capacity and critical decision-making. Legal issues of competency coupled with \"dispute time\" will simply compound and delay the prudent exercise of financial and health care judgments required, particularly when the patient has no immediate relative who is both responsible and committed to be involved right through the end. No investment broker or bank manager will take the knowledgeable initiave to \"protect\" the investor or bank customer, as long as the management fee or money reinbursement are guaranteed to them. In my own final analysis, personal trust in a relative or friend and foresight in planning for the eventual or inevitable are effective risk mitigators for all concerned.", "recommendationCount": 64}, {"assetID": 2019929, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/health/healthspecial/31finances.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2766614, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "CM", "createDate": "1288501560", "userID": 55459139, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1288502494", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1288498894", "commentSequence": 12, "commentBody": "The stories of once-astute people losing their life savings as a result of mental incompetence are heartbreaking, and will become more common, I predict, as the percentage of persons receiving income from defined-benefit (read traditional) pension plans decreases.

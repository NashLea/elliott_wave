I feel that ANYTHING that brings a family together or helps us interact with our kids benefits us through casual communication and builds bridges that will be vital to us at some point in our lives. We seem to have a notion that \"mindless\" gaming is bad or unhealthy. As with anything, only in excess. Many studies have indicated that such mindless activities allow the subconscious \"mind\" to process more important information. Solutions to difficult problems or situations often come to me if I put them out of my head for a while, and I believe it's equally valuable to children (maybe more so). There seems to be an assumption in the comments that this is the ONLY interaction between father and sons, but why? And would a game of Candyland, Trouble, Risk or any of the countless board games available be viewed as bad? There's plenty of pressure to learn/succeed/achieve/dominate, yet harmless fun creates a man-child. Ok, maybe the guy stays up too late, maybe slightly obsessed, perhaps he's a lot like me (if you score \"total destruction\" with the Mighty Eagle you get an eagle feather next to your score!) I'm within spitting distance of 50, have NEVER enjoyed electronic games (with the exception of playing some Wii with my daughters), but I'm hooked. And I've only been late for work once since the game came out. (New update for Seasons version in May, can't wait!) So numb out, as long as you numb back in for most of the ride. Building a house takes a lot of \"adult\" planning and organization these days, but I try to laugh and have some fun while I do it.

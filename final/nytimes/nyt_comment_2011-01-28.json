Cries of \"America, don't let this happen to you!\" Generational warfare ensues and \"entitlements\" for older Americans are stripped away. Of course, those entitlements were paid with blood and soul-crushing work by the retirees but why ruin a good Ayn Rand story? Look at the comments already. One bozo wants baby boomers to retire to make way for young workers. There are NO jobs! Not for anyone. Baby boomers are broke, down-sized, and deflated. Retire with what? And if they could retire, how does an unemployed baby boomer create a job by retiring? Here's a quarter. Buy yourself a clue, son necause this show is coming to a town near you too.<br /><br />Let Japan figure out their problems and let us figure out ours. I'll bet they manage theirs better than we do ours. They are savers. They invest in infrustrucure. They are highly educated. Americans, not so much. And you know all that extra special American entrepreneurship? Well, it's a whole new world. Capital moves easily across oceans (the way jobs already have) and I'll bet the next apple, or the one after that, comes from somewhere in the East.

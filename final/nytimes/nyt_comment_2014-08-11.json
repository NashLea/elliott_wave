Our past and our future may well come to haunt us some day, When we start genetically modifying animals and human beings to create  better and more perfect entities  for not only food but other purposes such as military robots as killing machines  etc. Of course we did use slaves like animals , by branding them, have them reproduce for better stock, selling them using those attributes.<br/>We may even consider that  there are  young  boys , girls  , pet etc that go missing and never heard from again. Perhaps there are  some other aliens from outer space that are capturing these missing ones and taking them  back where they originate. Experimenting with them  to create better or even weaker specimen, for use as per their own needs and may be even survival.<br/>It is not something far fetched, but  just a mere speculation that if we do it here on this earth for our survival, why not others  for their.  The taboo is just in our own minds.<br/>Do we think that sharks make any distinction  or  even man eating lions  ever did when they got to like human flesh. The simple deduction is that if we can rear other animals for food,  why  should they not use us for their food. After all we are in many away animals too, and have evolved that way.  In the whole realm of the Universe, we may consider us  as something unique, but  that is just for our own self interests and may be even self righteousness.

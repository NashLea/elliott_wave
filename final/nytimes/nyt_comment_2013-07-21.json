The assault of strange infections with their lingering manifestations on what were once strong, young bodies haunted us and served as a constant topic of conversation.\"Please, if I ever get to the stage I'm helplessly soaking in my own drool, I've stashed enough drugs to put me to sleep.\" We then confided in those we trusted the location of a bottle or box of pills we hoped would ensure us a comfortable enduring sleep society usually reserves only for blind, incontinent poodles. <br/><br/>Somehow that pandemic overlooked me. Yet we helped many who begged us to help death kindly stop for them. We weren't concerned with laws or illegal acts.

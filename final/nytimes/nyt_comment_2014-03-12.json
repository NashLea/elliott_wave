Just because sunshine laws exist doesn't mean the CIA has the right to go through congressional computers at will. Same as they don't have the right to wake up senators in the middle of the night on the pretext of sunshine to effectively harass them and give the impression that they're hiding something. There has to be a balance between the ultimate public-ness of these records and the dignity and process of running the government.

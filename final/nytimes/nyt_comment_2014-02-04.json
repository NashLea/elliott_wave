It takes time for a population to get plugged in to the health care network - finding a primary care physician, for example, as a first step.  Until the integration occurs, the emergency rooms will continue to be (over)used. <br/><br/>Similarly, comparing these trials to drug trials is specious.  The \"placebo controlled, double blind\" experiment is under increasing fire on ethical grounds: it is not OK to deny care to a placebo group when an positive effect is found, just to satisfy a protocol or to improve statistics.  Further, it is hotly debated whether a \"placebo\" is an ethically appropriate standard - why isn't a proven drug set as a standard?  This has substantial bearing on pharmaceutical costs in the US, where proprietary, patented drugs are touted as the latest and greatest, while offering small, if any, advantages over older, off-patent drugs.

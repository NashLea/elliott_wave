As a result, through week 13 of the season, 46% of kickoffs have been touchbacks, which is a large increase from 19% last year.  One of the plays with great potential for excitement has been taken from the game because of concerns for safety.<br/><br/>I understand the need for safety as a general rule with the NFL, especially given how many injuries occur during a season.

Taking away the kickoff is like shortening a movie or shrinking a potato chip package.  If we\u2019re not getting as much for our dollar, and as a result, the NFL ought to lower ticket prices.

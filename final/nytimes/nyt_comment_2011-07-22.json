Sure, it really motivates developers to update their apps, but it also forces a lot of users to pay for a large number of upgrades simultaneously. <br/><br/>Rosetta should have been allowed to continue on as a paid piece of software from Apple's very own App Store. It's a perfect platform to sell niche pieces of software that need to pay their own way after the market as a whole has moved on.

Grandfathers had less education than my sons, who are in grad school. Yet my parents spoke of plentiful jobs after W.W. II, especially with a college degree. The 1950's were good times for them and into the 1960's. I read recently that if inflation were to keep up with what we had even in the mid 1970's, minimum wage should be $24/hr. So, let's face it...these are different times. Even though it would hurt my aging parents, and eventually my inheritance, I think they should raise taxes.  They should pay more taxes or some day, my sons, even with their  PhD's,and MD/PhD, and  MD in surgery, will not be able to repay school debt and begin careers. They are already working crazy long hours and struggling to begin paying off debt, deferring families, to get trained. They work and study so hard and it has been so difficult for them and for me, on a teacher's salary, to cover these expenses. So, raise taxes! It is only fair and will determine the future health of the country.

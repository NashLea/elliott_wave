A skeet or trap shotgun is typically quite long, and usually has very low capacity, which would make it not the best choice for home defense use.<br/><br/>Kay - I think training and regular practice are important to gain and retain familiarity and proficiency with one's firearms.  I myself do not hunt.  But the caliber most often used in an AR15, 5.56mm, is actually one of the least powerful rifle cartridges out there.  It is actually illegal to hunt deer with that caliber in many states as the round is considered too weak to be used to humanely harvest deer.  For game like deer, elk, and larger, calibers like .30-06,.308, 7mm magnum and others are often used.  Some game is hunted at much greater range/distance too, which also requires more powerful calibers.  AR15's and AR10's are available in calibers more suited to hunting deer.  More hunters are beginning to use the AR for the same reasons I spoke of before.....it is light, accurate, rugged, and versatile.  The 5.56mm cartridge may be used for smaller game like coyote, or prairie dogs.<br/><br/>And registration does not necessarily equal confiscation, but it is often the first (and arguably necessary precursor) to confiscation.

I respect other people's right to disagree with me on the issue of gun control.  I don't really think anyone on either side of the debate is going to convince someone on the opposing side to change their point of view on this matter.  I don't try to.  I will gladly answer someone's questions about firearms or shooting if they ask, even if they are anti-gun.  There is soooo much misinformation about firearms out there, and people who have had little or no exposure to, or education on guns don't know any better.  And that lack of familiarity and that misinformation can  color their opinions.<br/><br/>The AR15 is one of the most popular rifles in the country.   It is not some strange, rare, fringe element weapon.  It is a completely modular design that is very well suited to a variety purposes for which a rifle is appropriate including self-defense, hunting, short and long range target shooting, and competition.  It is a light, accurate, rugged, and versatile platform.  It is not more deadly than any other rifle.  The \"regular guns\" that many gun control proponents feel are acceptable are significantly more powerful.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'll just say that because someone owns a handful of guns does not mean they possess an \"arsenal\".  Guns are tools, and different guns are suited to different uses.  A shotgun used for skeet wouldn't be a great choice for a home defense shotgun,  and neither would be ideally suited as a hunting shotgun.

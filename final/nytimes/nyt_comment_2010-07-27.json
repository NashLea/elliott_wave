However, this discussion leads to a another area that is just as broad - the nature of the present political economic systems and the ethos underpinning them.  Many, if not most industrial economies (capitalism, corporatism, and even most forms of socialism) rely upon continued growth for their viability.  To sustain this growth requires the people consuming more.  Coupled with this is the structure of the younger generations through retirement funds, etc. supporting the older persons no longer in the workforce.  Perforce, biology seems to mandate that the more able bodied support the aging population, and with time, there must be more (increased population) of those able-bodied persons.  In the US many persons receiving funds from the Social security (SS) SS  fund but do not have other funds to support themselves, thus needing to find work.  I suspect that such is the case in many other industrialized countries.  Additionally, there is an ever increasing burden on  infrastructure of health and other social services, and this requires correspondingly increasing revenue.  In places like the US, this problem is exacerbated by the lack of a truly universally accessible health care system.  The recently passed \"health care\" bill is not adequate, as it imposes intolerable expenses (to the benefit of the insurance company parasites) on the average worker. For social security recipients, for whom an an upper end check would amount to a few hundreds of dollars over a thousand, the Medicare expenses often amount to $100 or even $200 dollars.  Without supplemental income, such is quite a burden.  This says nothing about out-of-pocket expenses for \"Plan B\" and/or \"Plan C\".  As a result of the lack of a civilized health care and social services system taxpayers wind up paying even more for emergency responses.  This requires more taxpayers, i.e., population growth.<br /><br />All this indicates that industrial growth requires population growth.   At some point, the whole industrial economy ideology of continued increased growth and production to keep money in circulation (velocity of capital) must be supplanted by systems that rely upon a steady state and even declining material status.  Why, for example do people think they need two, three, or even more of anything, as opposed to a basic set of whatever to make life commodious.<br /><br />Not only must the population be reduced to pull back from the environmental abyss, but we need to have a serious amount of introspection as to our values, i.e., what is meaningful in life.  Surely, there must be higher values that consumerism, materialism, and greed.  Any empty head can sustain these.  Even hogs can do better; apparently, they are rather intelligent.  From my admittedly prejudicial perspective, I such a good start to addressing population growth and attendant environmental destruction would be philosophy and meditation.

See the following link and observe that countries with relatively high population growth like Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh consume less energy than those countries where population growth is minimal or almost zero like Japan, France, Germany, and the US. I believe we should first talk about modes of production, distribution, and consumption of goods, which are for the most part anarchic and address socially created wants instead of human basic needs. We need to prioritize our policies to effectively reduce superfluous energy use and overcome poverty and ignorance.  That is the end product of equality and democracy.

Fossil fuels are called fossil fuels because you find fossils in them, or they originated with ancient living things.   Oil and gas, being fluid, don't have fossils, but they came from once living things.   You can find lots of fossilized plants in coal.   You don't find fossils in uranium mines, but you could get your uranium from coal cinders and ashes.   You CAN get uranium and thorium and arsenic, lead and a long list of minerals from coal cinders and ashes.   In fact, the Manhattan project considered coal ashes and cinders as its source for uranium.<br /><br />Coal fired power plants put 100 to 400 times as much radioactivity into the environment as nuclear plants are allowed to.   Our nuclear power plants could be fully fueled by the uranium in coal ashes and cinders.   Average coal contains 1 or 2 parts per million uranium.   A 1000 megawatt coal fired power plant burns 4 Million tons of coal each year.   Multiplying that out, the coal fired power plant ashes contain 4 to 8 tons of uranium per year, which is plenty to fuel an equal sized Generation 2 nuclear plant for a year.<br /><br />Isn't it strange that the coal fired power plant gets to dump its nuclear waste without objection, and coal cinders and ashes are used as building materials?", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1685975, "replies": [], "lft": 140, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/next-steps-on-climate-and-energy-2/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2308927, "rgt": 141, "userDisplayName": "melty", "createDate": "1280199658", "userID": 34088373, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1280204020", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "West Orange, NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1280200420", "commentSequence": 64, "commentBody": "Andy: response to #26: two thumbs up!

We so obviously overestimate the economic costs of moderate taxation and regulation of fossil fuels to help contain our outrageous usage.  Even putting aside the climate issue, which while irrefutably dangerous is, unfortunately, not solely in our citizens' control, making it still more difficult to take action on-- the simple fact is that as living standards increase in the developing world, the era of cheap, easily available fossil fuels will soon be over.  It is the obligation of public policy in the United States to help contain our runaway usage of fuel, not just to save the planet, but to soften the near-term (as in before 2020, I would guess) shock to our economy that rapidly escalating fuel costs will deliver.  It should be remembered that while  the global recession sent fuel prices down a peg, the 2.5 billion people living in India, China, and South America experienced rising living standards throughout 2009 and 2010, and increased their energy usage accordingly.  The major oil companies are already forced not just into dangerous, deepwater drilling to find new reserves, but into the hugely wasteful use of oil sands.

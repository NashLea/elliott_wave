I'm afraid Sen. Kyl &amp; former half-Gov. Palin, along with most other Republican \"leaders,\" wouldn't know what you were getting at. Unfortunately, Americans suffering under nonsensical Republican obstructionism get the joke. We get it because the joke's on us.<br /><br />And the laughs keep coming. Just look what's been reported in the last 24-hour news cycle:<br /><br />The \"liberal\" Republican Sen. Scott Brown from Taxachusetts blocked a vote on extending jobless benefits, which expired at midnight, because \"We just found out today, or late yesterday, that we were even going to talk about this.\" Right. Brown had no idea the Congress was leaving two million Americans destitute. Whose fault is that? I knew about it, &amp; so did most of those two million Americans about to lose their benefits. Why, I'll bet the Chinese embassy staff knew about it, too.<br /><br />Meanwhile over at the White House, the President appointed Friend of the Banksters Tim Geithner to \"negotiate\" with Republicans on tax breaks for the wealthy. Never mind that those tax breaks will force us to borrow more from China, my money (what little I have) is on Geithner's caving to the wealthy immediately if not sooner. That should make for some very cheery Chinese embassy cables.<br /><br />And those elections the Chinese found so comical? The Chinese and most Americans probably think they were over a month ago. But they're not. In Alaska, the state asked a court to expedite a suit brought by Joe Miller, who lost the election by thousands of votes but who has brought what the state calls as \"unfounded\" challenge against the results. In Minnesota, they're still counting votes in the governor's race, with the Republican candidate challenging a ridiculous number of election board decisions. Monday he claimed that a totally blank ballot was a vote for him. Our quaint little elections really are laughable.<br /><br />Oh, and that civil war we had a century-and-a-half ago? Some Americans can't quite get over it just yet. Throughout the South, the Times reports, they're planning \"secession balls\" &amp; other hoopla to celebrate the states' seceding from the Union. Oh, glory. I lived in a mixed-race neighborhood (not so easy to find in these parts), but that doesn't stop one of my lovely white neighbors from flying the Confederate flag. Wonder how a rebel flag would fly in China?<br /><br />In fact, about the only news from the last 24-hour cycle that might have the Chinese embassy staffers scratching their heads is the Supreme Court's concern for the \"horrendous conditions\" (Justice Breyer's words) in California jails. The Supremes didn't seem to agree on what to do about the overcrowding in California jails, but at least they cared. It's likely the Chinese would wonder what the fuss was all about.

But I disagree on one thing - your statement that we are too politically polarized.  Instead, on the critical economic and foreign policy issues we face, we are not polarized enough.<br /><br />In particular, we have one side, the Republicans, who aggressively fight for exactly what they believe in.  On the other side, the Democrats too often give into the incessant message from the conservative media that the Democrats need to sacrifice their core beliefs in favor of timid centrism and \"bi-partisanship.\"  As a result, our political system has moved consistently rightward, even while reality shows the need to move leftward.<br /><br />So, over the past 30 or so years we have enacted massive deregulation of financial, banking, credit card, and housing industries.  We progressives knew that such deregulation would result in the spectacular meltdown that occurred over the past couple of years.  Unfortunately, too many Democrats were unwilling to aggressively fight such deregulation and so we have essentially conceded the argument to the Republicans even though they are wrong.<br /><br />On Iraq, Republicans did whatever they could to invade, which was a disastrous waste of lives and resources.  Progressives knew it was a bad idea, but too many Democrats wanted to appear to be \"centrists\" and so voted for it.<br /><br />On the economy, Republicans fought every effort at stimulus.  Democrats knew that significantly more stimulus was needed, but instead they cut back in an effort to appear centrist.<br /><br />And Republicans have been working to undermine the critical role of government in our society. Progressives know the importance of government in developing and maintaining infrastructure, regulating industry, protecting our environment and public health, and providing a safety net.  But too many Democrats have declined to offer a full-throated defense of government as they were concerned that such an approach would undermine their appearance of centrism.<br /><br />The result of all of this is that way too few people have been fighting for the bold progressive change that we need to restore our economic strength here at home and our moral strength abroad. As progressives, we need to start demanding that the Democrats do better in fighting back against the conservative viewpoint that is undermining the fabric of our society.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br /><br /> ", "recommendationCount": 578}, {"assetID": 2131732, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/opinion/01friedman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2916383, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Frunobulax", "createDate": "1291174606", "userID": 50176648, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1291180616", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1291180616", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "You may have inadvertently hit on a strategy to rouse the bumpkins on Capitol Hill: bring back the specter of The Yellow Peril, this time recast mostly as an economic imperative but retaining some of the racist and xenophobic rhetoric to appeal to the \"American Exceptionalists,\" those drearily unexceptional folks that love to hate someone, anyone, anything.

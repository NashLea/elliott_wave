It is the government at the state and federal level that is subsidized by the oil industry.  Start with the royalties paid to the government by the oil industry.  It is several times what the government spends managing and regulating the oil industry so the surplus goes to pay for other government operations.  Now add the state and federal gas tax put on every gallon of gas sold in gas stations across the country.  It has totaled about three and a half times the pretax profit of the industry over the last thirty years.  Now since the industry is one of the most consistently profitable industries it regularly pays a higher portion of their revenue in federal and state income taxes.  It has averaged paying 45% of its income in tax.  This doesn't count the property tax paid by refineries, pipelines, trucking companies, gas stations, etc.  The bottom line is that government agencies skim out more than ten times the revenue the stockholders get to keep as after tax income to pay dividends or to reinvest in capital equipment or exploration.  So I ask is the oil industry subsidized by the government or is the government subsidized by the oil industry.<br /><br />In Wisconsin where I live the state transportation fund paid for by the gas tax is consistently raided to pay for an out of control school budget, medicaid costs, etc. to the tune of a billion a year.  I ask again who is subsidizing whom?<br /><br />This industry employs more than 9 million people in this country who also pay taxes.  I ask again who is subsidizing whom?<br /><br />My final question is, what is the rational for everyone wanting to destroy this industry with nothing financially viable to replace it?", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 1713076, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/fire-and-water-on-a-hot-turbulent-planet/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2357160, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "Mark A.

The main source of emission explosion (not a good thing for the planet whether it is responsible for climate change or not) are going to be the developing nations and rightfully, so to speak, so. Nobody told the industrialized countries what to do some 150 years ago and only obviously dangerous stuff like poluted cities and waterways resulted in our current attempts to regulate the abuse. Generating electricity by burning fossil fuels, however, is not an abuse, no civilization can survive without it. OK, some apparantly can: France with 70% nuclear power electricity generation, some Scandinavian countries with comparable contribution from wind.<br /><br />Revkin outlines lot of goals but one basic information is missing: there is no point to wait for detailed studies how much, exactly, alternative sources in this country can contribute to the basic goal of generating enough electricity that can, at some point in the future (the percentage of hybrids and electric cars is, so far, negligible) replace polluting internal combustion automobiles.<br /><br />What is that number plus minus, say, 10%? That is the basic stuff Revkin avoids. The 'trend' (i.e. the SLOPE of the hopefully rising curve) tells us nothing about the reality.<br /><br />Revkin may be correct about major 'strategy goals'. For us who do not really follow the details just two numbers are essential: the best and worst scenario for replacement fossil fuels as the source of ALL energy in this country by, say, 2030 in percentages.<br /><br />Is about 20% the best or the worst scenario? I have no idea. All I know for a fact that a wind turbine farm here in the San Gorgonio pass (near Palm Spring) is mostly idle whenever I drive there several times a year. My query to California Edison about its utilization was, of course, ignored. California Edison shows these turbines ten times a day in a TV commercial that is a waste of money anyway - in their area of service they have a monopoly, we cannot switch to another electricity provider. OK, they just want us to support their future rate increases, I gather.<br /><br />Many subsidies will be used to build similar installations all over the country but will they be actually utilized? Another basic question. Nuclear power stations are, as far as I know, utilized quite efficiently while in operation. It is no coincidence that Revkin, forever the Green Guru, does not mention nuclear energy at all.<br /><br />Fine, but show us the alternatives in percentage of total energy generation. Anything below 15% is not very meaningful. Is it achievable?

In truth, drawing the line between man made climate change and the pine beetle outbreak is a stretch that few experts make. Rather, most see the outbreak as a natural function of forests and in many ways it is Mother Nature correcting man\u2019s previous mistakes.<br /><br />Colorado finds itself front and center in the battle against the mountain pine beetle. In the coming weeks the state\u2019s forest service will be releasing its annual report and is expected to estimate that 2.5 million acres have been infected by the beetles since 1996 \u2013 the largest outbreak in state history. However, that represents a fraction of the state\u2019s forest land and areas are being naturally rehabilitated after the infections pass.<br /><br />The state\u2019s forest service is reluctant to connect man made climate change with the outbreak and studies have shown that while the outbreak is large, it is not entirely unprecedented. Sky Stephens, Forest Entomologist for the Colorado State Forest Service, says that while climate change is a hot topic, there hasn\u2019t been a \u201cwell structured argument\u201d connecting the two.<br /><br />Indeed, the state points to what it calls a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of drought, recent warmer winters and forests that are denser than what nature intended. Any one of those factors could lead to an increase in beetle populations but coupled together, it becomes a difficult situation for foresters to manage.<br /><br />Man may indeed have played a large role in the spread of the mountain pine beetle but not in the way climate change activists portray.<br /><br />For the latter half of the 20th century as people settled in forested areas in greater numbers, forest fires drew more attention. While in centuries past fires burned unabated as part of a natural cycle of the earth, man now was coming to the \u201crescue\u201d and putting out the fires. In doing so, an unintended consequence of forest overgrowth was realized. By eliminating the natural death and re-birth cycle that fire brings, forests became more dense and just as critically, they have matured to an age that is ripe for pine beetles to attack.<br /><br />Stephens said that our desire to stamp out fires in unpopulated areas did more harm than good. \u201cIt set us up for a number events that have and are going to happen,\u201d she said. Stephens said the forests were never meant to have the dense stands that we have grown accustomed to seeing and the more food there is for the beetles, the greater the impact when they attack.<br /><br />Dave Thom, a natural resources officer with the Black Hills National Forest agrees with Stephens. Of trying to point the finger at man made climate change, he told the Rapid City Journal last month, \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d<br /><br />    That phenomenon [the pine beetle epidemic] can happen regardless of a few degrees of change in climate, measured on a global scale.<br />    ~ Dave Thom, Black Hills National Forest<br /><br />The drought and the dense forests play a big factor according to Thom. He said, \"As the trees get more dense, they are less able to resist bark-beetle infestations. When you take increasingly dense trees and add the drought, the intersection causes weakened trees that are more susceptible to beetle attack. That phenomenon can happen regardless of a few degrees of change in climate, measured on a global scale.\"<br /><br />Researchers point to outbreaks in the past that killed millions of lodgepole pines, before global temperatures rises are thought to be having an effect. The Rocky Mountains suffered through outbreaks in the 1960s, the 1970s and the early 1980s. A different beetle, the spruce beetle, is known to have caused extensive damage in western Colorado in the 1940s.<br /><br />    There is no evidence to support the idea that current levels of bark beetle or defoliator activity are unnaturally high.<br />    ~ Colorado Forest Restoration Institute<br /><br />A recent study completed by the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute (CFRI) in conjunction with the Colorado State Forest Service and area universities flatly stated that the current outbreak is not unusual. \u201cThere is no evidence to support the idea that current levels of bark beetle or defoliator activity in Colorado\u2019s lodgepole pine and spruce-fir forests are unnaturally high,\u201d the study said.<br /><br />Before outbreaks were documented, tree-ring evidence points to extensive outbreaks before the 20th century as well. As the CFRI study said, \u201cInsect outbreaks are a natural occurrence in almost all of the different kinds of forests in Colorado. Outbreaks do not occur very frequently; the time interval between successive outbreaks in any given area is usually measured in decades. Nevertheless, outbreaks can be expected periodically in almost any place in the state where forests are found.\u201d<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.climatechangefraud.com/behind-the-science/5432-must-read-the-pine-beetle-hysteria-exposed-natural-not-manmade\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.climatechangefraud.com...</a><br /><br />Best Wishes", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1723362, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/snurfer/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2358071, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Nhart", "createDate": "1281067398", "userID": 31523591, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281067515", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "West Texas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281063915", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "Well, the criminal defense lawyer here got CLIENTS right away, but was stumped on PAROLE until the last minute.

The bill will charge businesses for emissions, lower the budget deficit, will have limited negative economic impacts, and low and middle income Americans will receive rebates, effectively shielding them from all or most of the costs potentially passed down.  Some permits will be provided to utilities initially, economically easing the transition to cleaner energies.  Millions of clean energy jobs will be created.  According to leading climate scientists and economists, the legislation will be a modest and important first step towards advancing clean energy technologies and combating global warming.  As an important side benefit, air and water pollution will be lowered substantially.  The thousands of people nationwide that die every year from exposure to coal and oil pollution and the tens of billions per year that such pollutions costs will be lowered substantially.\"<br /><br />All factual, and supported by CBO/DoE and peer-reviewed scientific analysis.

As yet, there are no real commitments from individuals, corporations and governments to bring back the forests as these were a hundred years ago (at least).<br /><br />Without a fix on the absorption side of the carbon cycle, no amount of fixing on the emission side will ever have an impact in mitigating climate change.<br /><br />The forests are burning.

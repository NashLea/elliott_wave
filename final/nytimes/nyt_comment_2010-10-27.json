First it was not the \"inflation Carter's Presidency.  High inflation began before Carter took office (remember Ford\" WIN (whip inflation now) buttons?)  Second, Reagan had nothing to do with it. In fact, his policies created the biggest deficits in American history outside of war and were thus inflationary by any counter-cyclical theory.  It was the Fed that stopped inflation by driving interest rates so high the economy crashed and we went through the worst recession from the Great Depression until that time.  In the 1982 midterms the Republicans lose many House big and Reagan's approval rating was lower that Obama's is now.  That might put a different perspective on what is happening today.<br /><br />The real problem of the United States is not economic, it is political. Our government is dysfunctional. We love to brag about our separation of powers system and how it represents genius, but it is the antiquated product of 18th century Enlightenment thinking and makes governing the country impossible.  Obama cannot command a majority in Congress because members are controlled by local interests and concerns.  The \"filibuster-proof majority\" argument assumes that the 60 Democrats would vote in lock-step for whatever Obama proposed. In the American system, when you get to that large of a majority you will have some members who come from states that are much friendly to the other party and those individuals will demand many compromises to go along.  Bargaining with them inevitably means watering down whatever is proposed.  Even worse our \"democratic\" system has a legislative body in which 41 votes beats 59 votes. Nothing of real substance can be achieved. It is all watered down weak compromise or nothing.  In Great Britain the government proposed decisive new policies and they will get them.  I am not saying I agree with their policies but there will be a direction set and policies enacted and the people will be able to judge the results and decide who to reward and who to punish.

How could that be?  The Stimulus IS creating jobs, as promised.  Yet overall losses continue.<br /><br />Governments at all levels are cutting back staffing due to budget shortfalls.   Why are they starving?  Could it be Grover Nordquist is finally getting what he wants?  To kill the \u201cBeast\u201d by denying it funding through Tax Cuts, Tax Cuts and more Tax Cuts, foisted on us by the Neo-Con conspiracy.   That we have a two-pronged recession, one in the public sector, the other in governance strongly supports two different basic causes.   We know a major cause of the public sector was the destruction wrought on our financial system by years of unrestrained Free Market ideology and the subsequent scams and looting.   Our Government ails from the double whammy of unrestrained spending on war, the military and paybacks to donors and their corporations combined with decreased income due to Tax Cuts.<br /><br />The Stimulus is working, creating jobs and increasing profits.  It\u2019s just not reaching Government.  So it\u2019s time for a Stimulus that helps Government create and maintain employment as well.  A triple pronged approach ought to do it: cut wasteful spending for wars and military, increase spending for long term improvements such as education and public works (i.e. infrastructure) and restore taxes to levels that support that spending.<br /><br />We were in a recession long before Bush/Cheney/Rove left office, caused by their policies and decisions.

The answer is simple.  When the government takes away less of the income of both consumers and businesses, consumers have more money to spend, sales increase at the retail level; businesses have more to spends, sales increase at the business to business level.  As demand increases at both the consumer and business level, businesses act to meet that demand with more product, more production and more workers.<br /><br />The problem is that the simplicity of the idea of reducing taxes to increase buying and demand, as with more people working earning more money, with more businesses making more money, the tax revenues rather than declining actually increase the fastest when the economy is naturally stimulated by putting more money into the hands of Americans, no strings attached.  We have seen over and over again that the tendency of the liberals to try to micromanage the economy provides nothing more than short term blips that rapidly evaporate as soon as the targeted stimulus dollars dry up.<br /><br />The American people are going to give the Democrats their report card at the beginning of next month.", "recommendationCount": 5}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

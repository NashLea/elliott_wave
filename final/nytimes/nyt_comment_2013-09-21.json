The GOP blames the immigrants for taking away Joes jobs.  The sad thing is it is the GOP policies of the past thirty years that did this but it is much easier for Joe to focus on specific people causing this and not a failed economic ideology.<br/><br/>Joe is basically a scared and wounded animal and hence not thinking rationally.  i sadly dont see anyway to help Joe think rationally though which means there is no end in sight to this madness, since no amount of facts can make an irrational person see things rationally.  it requires a very strong safety net and a smart works pogram but how on earth would that ever pass?"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10039215, "replies": [], "commentID": 10040189, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "sfd", "createDate": "1379763412", "userID": 47136928, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1379781558", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 3, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Mark Hugh Miller", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Lithuania", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1379777958", "commentSequence": 10040189, "commentBody": "Yes, the GOP has become the cynical leading the gullible.

Sadly, the same can be said about Texas, however, there is another component at work here.  If you drive 30 miles outside of Houston, you will be forgiven if you think that you have stumbled into rural Mississippi. The ignorance, racial attitudes and refusal to acknowledge anything other than what Limbaugh and Fox \"News\" tells them are the same. They have voted Republican all their lives and will continue to do so because they have an unreasonable hatred of \"Big Government\", even as they accept the unemployment, Social Security and Medicare that their party is intent on stealing from them. I see no way of reaching these people.<br/><br/>What we can do is vote!  Statistics have proven that Tea Party voters are in reality a small, albeit very vocal, minority.  The one thing they do have going for them is that they vote.  Liberals must go out and vote these miserable excuses for human beings that are the Republicans out of office.  We have the numbers, we just need the same will and urgency that the Tea Party demonstrates.  The specter of both the House and the Senate in Republican control is too frightening to contemplate."}]}, "lft": 104, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/opinion/blow-kamikaze-congress.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 10039215, "rgt": 115, "userDisplayName": "Mark Hugh Miller", "createDate": "1379739366", "userID": 3770357, "replyCount": 5, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1379739426", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1379735826", "commentSequence": 10039215, "commentBody": "If Democrats and independent progressives succeed in convincing Americans who are the rope in the partisan tug-of-war going on since George W.

I was a teenager when I lost both parents to cancer. They both died in the hospital; we could only visit during rigid visiting hours. The last afternoon I saw my mother she was barely conscious and I gave her water with a teaspoon; it was the only way she could take fluids. The next morning my Dad knocked on my bedroom door with the news that my mother had died.<br/><br/>Six months later Dad was in the hospital. The last night I saw him he was still conscious and lucid. He held my hand and said, \"I don't think I am coming home.\" Then at the age of sixteen I didn't know what to say to this. We just held hands. The next day at school I was called to the office where they told me Dad had died and I was excused from school until after the funeral. That was it. It was 1968 and I was an orphan.<br/><br/>As painful as the death of a loved one is, I am sure the hospice process where families are allowed as much time together as they need, and pain medications are available to the patient, is much more humane than closing the dying off from the living.<br/><br/>Thank you for sharing your grief. I too would give anything for another five minutes with Mom and Dad.", "recommendationCount": 18}, {"assetID": 3382798, "replies": [], "lft": 93, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/opinion/collins-knowing-when-to-worry.html", "parentID": 10038707, "commentID": 10039220, "rgt": 94, "userDisplayName": "James Jordan", "createDate": "1379739436", "userID": 40498339, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1379739485", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Falls Church", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1379735885", "commentSequence": 10039220, "commentBody": "Karen,<br/><br/>When I heard the President say \"challenges on entitlements\" to the gathered Business Roundtable, I fell out of my chair.

I am bothered by the lack of attention given economic growth and putting American's back to work in good  paying jobs.  Current law is horrible.  The tax code is very unfair favoring the well-off and the cap on social security is the marquee of our policy's unfairness on entitlements and the minimum wage is a national shame.<br/><br/>I don't get it.

In fact, the only thing that *allegedly* separates the two sides is the owners' demand that all contracts over five years' duration be cancelled, and the players counter that they be honored, or at least, reworked into the five year or less format. The players have made literally dozens of proposals, some quite imaginative and smart, during the course of \"negotiations.\" The owners and Bettman have rejected 100% of them, and now have the gall to accuse the players of negotiating in bad faith.<br/>\nThe main problem with your argument is the assumption that ten owners will leave the league willingly. Think of how hard owners and fans worked to keep hockey alive in places like Buffalo and Pittsburgh. And think of the cushy giveaways to the Coyotes by Glendale, AZ. I think Chuckles Wang wants out, but he has the rich man's assumption that he should be made whole for the money he has lost owning the Islanders. As long as not one dime of the comes from my tax dollars, I'm OK with that, and I'm more than OK with an NHL without Wang. As for contract length, it was Wang who started the trend by negotiating a 15 year deal with Rick DiPietro behind his GM's back. Don't forget how the Devils tried to circumvent the cap by structuring Ilya Kovalchuk's deal over 17 years, and even after Bettman voided it, they are STILL way longer than 5 years.

The trade-off is cost containment \u2014 that\u2019s what the owners want \u2014 particularly since so many of the sunbelt teams, central to the expansion strategy, are hemorrhaging. Reasonable cost containment allows for both rising salaries and more jobs for players, whereas contraction, (the inevitable result of no cost containment), will ultimately reduce jobs and probably also salaries.<br/><br/>The decision to hire Fehr is understandable but it also is a reflection of the players not understanding that the financial underpinnings of their sport are very different from baseball and football. The owners keep walking away from negotiations after NHLPA proposals not because this is a tactic or because they \"are childish\" but because the financial imperatives bearing down on the sport dictate their position.

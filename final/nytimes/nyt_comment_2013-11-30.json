Invariably I'd hear stories and see the evidence that terrible loan conditions were imposed due to last minute submittal of loan agreements for buyer review. Pre-payment penalties when none should have been imposed, higher settlement fees, excessive fees to mortgage brokers, falsified income in the mortgage broker's handwriting, double and triple dealing by a mortgage broker who was also representing the seller AND the buyer, with a 3% bonus commission for a sub-prime loan plus 6% gross commission on the sale and the appraisal had been \"juiced\" well above market. And that was only what I could see 5 years after the fact. It was impossible to know whether the property was as advertised, inspections had been properly rendered or permits for updates had ever been issued.<br/><br/>On the investment properties of 1-4 units with which I have been involved, nearly always the loan docs and closing package arrive as we're sitting at the escrow office ready to sign.

Tryptophan is metabolized in the cerebrospinal fluid to give serotonin, and then melatonin, both of which may have significant affect on sleepiness.<br/><br/>But this will not happen from eating turkey.  Turkey is also rich in other amino acids that compete with tryptophan for transport into the brain, and these amino acids (branched chain amino acids) are more common than tryptophan is.  As a result, tryptophan is transported relatively slowly across the blood brain barrier- too slowly to build up the required serotonin and melatonin concentrations to have much effect.<br/><br/>However, if you eat lots of carbs with your meal, this triggers insulin release, which causes muscles to preferentially absorb branched chain amino acids.  This permits more rapid uptake of tryptophan and a greater synthesis of serotonin and melatonin.<br/><br/>So to review.  It's not the turkey.  It's really the carbs.  Anytime you change the ratio of BCAA's to tryptophan, you can induce greater tryptophan uptake and therefore synthesis of melatonin.  Eating carbs is one way to do this.

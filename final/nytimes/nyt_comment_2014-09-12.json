Krugman has actively campaigned for a return to normal inflation, since he is no fan of zero inflation and zero interest rates -- the infamous zero lower bound. Underinflation is not only bad for some parts of the population (people living on bond income, for example, or pension planners) but also because the zero lower bound robs central bankers of their best stimulus tool. <br/><br/>But the inflation cultists that Krugman's writing about haven't been shouting from the rooftops that inflation might return to 3% a year.

This will happen, they say, because the US is just like Greece, profligately overspending -- even though Greece for the past 5 years has been suffering from ongoing severe DEflation.

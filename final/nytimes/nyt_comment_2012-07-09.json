I worry that smarts won't suffice when, as Mitt has already counseled at a college rally, our kids are reduced to forgoing a higher education, or received such poor primary and secondary educations, that they will be at a huge disadvantage. When I look around me and listen to so many \"educated\" people spout off the GOP mantra in earnest, it is scary. How can healthcare for all and a good education at reasonable cost be harmful things? The GOP has had a huge amount of influence in so many areas of our lives, through ALEC and other means, winning this election will be our coup de grace.", "recommendationCount": 66}, {"assetID": 3329163, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 6577598, "replies": [], "commentID": 6578041, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Ken", "createDate": "1341816724", "userID": 64103269, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1341849111", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Tim Lucas", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Diego", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1341845511", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "It was signed into law on October 26, 2001 by George W.

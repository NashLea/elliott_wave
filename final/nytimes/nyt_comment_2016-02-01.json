So, if $2000p.c. is added to the government funds available for health care, the government funds should be approximately equal to total present U.S. spending on health care.  In other words, your proposal (which I agree isn't politically possible) would enable the government(s) here to take over all health care without raising taxes.<br/><br/>That is the conclusion I get.

The simple retort is that this claim is true (small \u201ct\u201d) from their perspective; it is not True, nor is it claimed to be True, writ large and eternal.  It is true within their relevant community as agreed to its members who argue about such things.  <br/><br/>Yet, contra relativism, there appears to be truths that are indefeasible.  The 6:40 leaves at 6:40, summer follows spring, water is H2O, and so on.  One way to think about these indefeasible \u201ctruths\u201d is to say that they are literal, de facto, truth claims that are existentially validated because they are settled. But when ordinary truths are reified into eternal verities, truth claims are not declarative social assertions, rather they become figurative, rhetorical, de jure, or aesthetic presentations because they outrun the evidence.  To justify such propositions would require an intuitive or transcendental stance, a correspondence between the facts of the world and our claims, or a God\u2019s eye view whereby we could compare our claims with the real to ensure their truthfulness. Yet none of these options pass the gold standard of objective truth\u2014incontrovertibility.<br/><br/>To avoid reified metaphysical spookiness, why not just say that claims are figurative presentations of how things ought to hang together. <br/><br/>The philosophist truthers cannot live with such indeterminacy; they crave solid ground, like the fundamentalist who flees from an open-ended interpretation of things religious because it causes too much anxiety.

But, I wonder that he does not question some of the evolutionary presumptions that go into the discussion of reasoning given by Sperber and Mercier.  More importantly, the selection of philosophers seems off given the topic.  While Peirce, Dewey, and James are quite important for a pragmatic theory of truth, Rorty seems to deny any concern for truth, and Habermas' concern centers more on issues of \"reaching agreement.\"  A more worthwhile path has already been laid out for discussing these issues by Alasdair MacIntrye, particular in his essay on \"Epistemological Crises, Dramatic Narrative, and the Philosophy of Science,\" as well as in some of his books.  The core idea is that we perceive truth through the \"best argument so far\" (which he has argued is attained by Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition).

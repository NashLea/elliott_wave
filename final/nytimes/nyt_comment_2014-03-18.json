The U.S. does not trade enough with Russia for our sanctions to hurt the Russian economy.  Europe CAN hurt the Russian economy with real sanctions if they're willing to take their own economic risks. European-Russian trade is a much bigger part of the Russian economy than it is the European economy. So Russia will hurt much more. The only hitch is Europe's dependence on Russian energy. Perhaps we can work to relieve that. I hope the U.S. has people working behind the scenes to help Europe with energy security with as little time gap as possible, especially before the next heating season.<br/><br/>I also hope it does not take Putin invading Eastern Ukraine to get the EU countries to get behind real sanctions that bite. The population of the \"mainland\" of Eastern Ukraine, with major cities such as Kharkiv &amp; Donetsk, may lean Russian.

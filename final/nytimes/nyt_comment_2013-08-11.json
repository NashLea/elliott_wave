I am a practitioner of both kinds of exercise. The fact often overlooked is that Pilates poses are all a subset of Yoga poses. The main difference between Yoga and Pilates is that Pilates is a dynamic exercise where motion has been added to the Yoga poses. In Yoga, one is traditionally supposed to maintain the poses statically for some time. [I do not know exactly how Joseph Pilates designed the moves, but I am pretty sure he was influenced by Yoga - I would call Pilates \"yoga-inspired\" exercise.] Given this insight, the question which exercise is better seems irrelevant to me. Yoga is way broader than sun salutations or core exercises and certainly way broader than Pilates (even for the core, Yoga has more poses than Pilates). A proper Yoga exercise routine (including core strengthening poses) not only strengthens and builds muscles throughout the body (including core), but also builds flexibility. Yoga being dangerous is a very ludicrous suggestion: I would like to know of an exercise that is not dangerous if performed improperly. This suggestion comes from people who either lack the flexibility to perform Yoga and are too negative to try it, or people who have injured themselves performing Yoga improperly. One thing is certain - to perform Yoga properly and without injury, the first thing the practitioner needs to give up is the ego that many athletes and trainers appear to be driven by in the West.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3379263, "replies": [], "lft": 97, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/ask-well-pilates-vs-yoga/", "parentID": 9692173, "commentID": 9698754, "rgt": 98, "userDisplayName": "Amit", "createDate": "1376182652", "userID": 29853298, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1376193680", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Madison, WI", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1376190080", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "That may be true in the West - primarily because performing yoga safely requires strong control over ego and mind.

The smiling faces of women performing yoga on the beach as if it were child's play constitute a very misleading picture of Yoga. No doubt, performing a pose becomes fun once one has mastered it and that is one among the great benefits of Yoga - you just cannot help loving it once you know how to do it, but learning a Yoga pose and learning to hold it can be very challenging if one lacks the muscle strength and flexibility and does not follow the scientific technique of the pose.<br/>\"Pilates..requires a lot more time involvement to advance; few people has the time or money to advance to higher level where every muscles are addressed.\" Again incorrect.

To some extent, strength of mind is involved in some other exercises such as high-intensity cardio and weight-lifting.

Unfortunately, the essence of your argument is something like: Because Pilates was developed for rehabilitation, Pilates cannot be considered exercise because one should not perform Pilates unless one has had some pain/ injury.

Hatha Yoga is exactly the same. I can understand that owing to cultural difference, this can be difficult to understand, but in Indian culture, Yoga (in the literal sense) is the sole purpose of life and Hatha Yoga prepares the body for it. Hatha Yoga has little to do with \"peace\" and \"meditation\" - those connotations are purely a figment of imagination in the West. \"Peace\" and \"happiness\" are two of GENERALLY sought after goals of life in Hinduism. \"Meditation\" is JUST ONE way of attaining that, and nothing prepares the body for meditation better than Asanas and Pranayama.

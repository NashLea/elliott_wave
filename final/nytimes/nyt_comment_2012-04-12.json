We add hay and liquid feed (protein and minerals/vits) in the winter only to supplement the dimiished forage quality to keep the herd and baby calves healthy.  We depend upon antibiotics when animals are injured or unhealthy, and we diligently conform to the labels that prescribe purpose for use and dosage based upon weight.  Ranchers don't abuse drugs, as it takes considerable effort to bring the cattle into the barnyard for treatment and drugs are costly.  <br/><br/>There are not enough vetereinarians specializing in livestock in the US.  The livestock industry is seriously recruiting students.  There aren't enough vets to make a ranch visits for every call to treat simple pink eye; or to drive an hour or more to the ranch to prescribe penicillin for a wound.  <br/><br/>One of my concerns is that animal welfare will be compromised by the unavailability of prompt veterinary response and prescriptions. Ranchers know that prompt treatment alleviates pain and stimulates healing, which we desire.  How long will it be reasonable for us to wait for the vet to answer the phone?  To drive to the ranch when they can get to it? We're all experienced at reading labels and giving shots, and we have a vet-patient relationship.

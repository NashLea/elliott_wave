Like most of us, the poor, tend to take too many cues about behavior from the people around them, learning from bad example how to continue in the same direction. <br/><br/>Having undiagnosed  ADD in the era before it was fully discovered and understood could be one starting marker for difficulties and eventual failure.<br/><br/>What we need to understand, further, is that poverty and defeat tend to be a downward spiral that can be set off by just a few events (the man in question had a series of really serious problems: mother's sudden death, abandonment by father, ADD, etc.). If one has money, mistakes or difficulties don't matter as much.

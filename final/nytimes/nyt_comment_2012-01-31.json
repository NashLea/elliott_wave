The faster news cycle as posited may be one factor. Presumably the growth of the internet and its social media is important here. But could it be that the freedom to expend greater amounts of money as a result of Citizens United is a factor?

We can only hope that the Republican voters realize this before it's too late. But I fear it may be, and Romney is not the candidate we need. By the end of this year's election, we may witness the final days of the Republican party as we know it, as true conservatives will have to come to terms with the fact that this party no longer represents conservative values and is controlled by neocons who will always ensure that people like Romney and McCain get the nomination. True conservatives will have to break off to form a third party (maybe a real, bonafide Tea Party). We can only hope, because that is what we will need.

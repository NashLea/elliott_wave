Most of my ivy league friends went on to investment banking in the 2000s, yet I (as a Babson grad) chose to pursue a career in public education and went on to a PhD program at Columbia. While I agree that it is a dangerous trend to pursue money over, say, learning, I wouldn't belittle Babson for being Money's most visible rep for its rankings. It's highly rigorous liberal arts program is what taught me to be different from other business people and what led me to believing that I can use my skills for the greater good. Babson teaches students to think independently and entrepreneurially, and students have both been highly successful in business and elsewhere with those mindsets. And while I would love for those who do not know what Babson represents to learn more about the school other than just saying \"Oh It's a business school,\" I realize that people will often speak in stereotypes rather than learning the truth in discourse.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3448564, "replies": [], "lft": 249, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-eviction-economy.html", "parentID": 17795435, "commentID": 17797243, "rgt": 250, "userDisplayName": "Richard Luettgen", "createDate": "1457240363", "userID": 47123844, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1457240409", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1457240409", "commentSequence": 17797243, "commentBody": "W.A.

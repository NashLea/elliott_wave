There is NO evidence that Rwanda's climate changed at all in the years before the genocide. <br/><br/>Recall the time and place, please; over 20 years ago just below the equator. In those days even the IPCC admitted that climate around the world was still well within historical records of natural variation, although they theorized that that soon would change. Their models suggested that climate change would be most readily detectable at the poles, not at the equator. <br/><br/>To blame the Rwandan genocide on climate change is not even speculation; it is revisionist history of the most blatant kind. The Rwandan genocide was only the latest episode in a centuries-old tribal hatred.<br/><br/>Snyder starts his op-ed piece with a Holocaust anecdote, a cheap rhetorical device avoided by all serious commentators.

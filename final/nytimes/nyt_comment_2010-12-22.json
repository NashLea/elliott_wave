For example, it is not likely that homeless people are given houses with mortgages.  It is more likely that they are housed in rooms and/or apartments built for this purpose or adapted for this purpose.  They are not \"given\" services without involving them in their own efforts towards improved living, whether it is outright independence or continued communal living.  What is different in this approach, is that stable housing is provided first, with services appropriate to their needs following.  The statistics quoted indicate that our assumptions about why people are homeless are not necessarily true.  But the most important thing about any program is matching services to needs. In our community in Chicago, there is a relatively small program called Hyde Park Transitional Housing, that serves carefully screened families, provides a furnished apartment for them, and provides training and mentoring over a period of time for the parents and children.  The goal is independence.  Other homelessness programs target people with different needs.  That is as it should be.  The Hyde Park program is not a government program.  But the people connected with it are involved in promoting workable government as well as private programs.

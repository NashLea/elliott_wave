It would not surprise me to find out that the board became aware of the issue once she filed her complaint and they were gathering their records to deal with her complaint.  This leads to my next issue, if she is operating in violation of the zoning ordinances then the condo association/board may have legal liability.  The Board would have legal liability to the other condo members for failing to deal with this violation in a manner which would limit the liability to the association.  Self reporting is usual the recommendation of lawyers.<br /><br />Second, the door issue as a couple of problems.  Perhaps this building has some historical protection which would not allow the door to be easily altered to a lower weight door.  Also, if this door solely serves her space she may have an obligation to maintain it.  If not perhaps there is a power assist solution that could be tried.  In my experience, often solutions like this are offered and rejected.  Either way the door situation is separate from the zoning.  Both may be in the wrong.<br /><br />Last, the whole misogynic issue raised by Jane (#149) and talked about by others, is a canard.  Breastfeeding has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for many.  Just because you CAN do it, doesn\u2019t mean you SHOULD do it in every single place in a manner in which you please.  It reminds me of the lack of consideration demonstrated by the Westboro Baptist Church.

When she was six months old, my father had a very serious health crisis so the baby and I traveled to his city to spend time with him. The baby not allowed in the hospital so my brothers fed my baby some bottles of formula.  I guess my baby liked the formula or the ease of bottle feeding: baby mouths'work harder to get milk from the breast? anyway, at about 8 months, having nursed less and less and less, the kid pulled away mid-meal, shook her tiny little fast and I knew she was done breastfeeding.  I guess she had been drinking less and less. My breasts seemed to dry up on their own, no trouble. . . .<br /><br />and getting started when the baby was born was just as easy. A nurse came around, wheeling my hours-old newborn in a clear lucite bassinet/cart thingie and cooingly suggested I have a lesson in breastfeeding. The oldest daughter of 8, I had always seen my mom and her firends breastfeeding the endless babies. I had large (then humongous! with all the milk) breasts, large nipples and by the time my baby was half a day old, my breasts were overflowing.<br /><br />Our first breastfeed went smooth, with the nurse cooing about colustrum, the first nutrient intense milk my body offered my baby.  My baby latched on.  I still rank breastfeeding as one of the all time best experiences of my life:  me and the baby were more bonded than when the baby had been still inside me, attached with the umbilical cord.<br /><br />I could have, easily, fed a couple more babies. The more my baby drank, the more my breasts delivered. I finally understood tales I had heard of lactating female slaves in the slave-owning American past who were constant breastmilk nannies for the white plantation babies. Women's breasts work like cow's milk bags work;  the more you pump, the more milk gets produced.<br /><br />My baby born in June. That first hot summer, I routinely pumped two four-ounce bottles of breast milk each morning when I arose, then stored the milk in the freezer. My husband could feed the baby when I happened to be away and the baby was hungry. We threw out a lot of that frozen milk but I kept doing it because it felt good to have the flexibility. All he had to do was hold the four-ounce glass bottle under the hot tap water and it melted and became a comfortable temperature for the baby and, we reasoned, it was fairly sterile:  from breast to freezer to hot water to baby. Anyway, our kid survived it.<br /><br />I had a manual pump that worked well if I got just the right suction and that pump held four ounces. I just had to attach the pump, pull a tiny moment to get the suction going and zippity-zap, four ounces gushed out.  I did one bottle on each side. I could have done, no kidding, 8 ounces on each side and, if I had kept that up, I could have milked a quart per side every day. My breasts were gigantic and gave every indication that they were prepared to get bigger if I pumped more.<br /><br />The main reason I limited each breast to that four ounce per breast morning pump was cause I figured I didn't want my breats to grow and grow and grow and the kid couldn't drink many quarts a day. I decided that if I limited the pumping to four ounces at the same time each day, four ounces per breast, my breasts would naturally know that was all they needed. It worked for me:  I didn't have excess milk all day: just in the morning when I first awoke to do the pump.<br /><br />I have read about many women who travel for business and spend small fortunes on electric milk pumps and expensive milk storage and staying in hotel rooms with fridges and feeling desparate to get every drop their prescious boobs produce into their infancts and I am willing to believe that breast milk is sparse for some moms.  Maybe nature knows what she is doing? Maybe the moms whose breasts do not gush like fountains, as mine did, just arent supposed to be the only source of nutrition for their babies?<br /><br />I have read tales of some mothers making the production and saving of their prescious breast fluid just way too frakking precious. It's just a natural body fluid, not a magic potion. Nature is complex and does what it does for reasons mysterious to us humble humans. Maybe some really great moms just weren't destined to do all the baby feeding from their breasts and maybe their life force is better spent on something else?<br /><br />Trust. Trust in the universe. Trust that the central power of the universe is love and that what happens in your life is, like it says in the desiderata, for all its sham and broken dreams, still working out exactly as it should. maybe not all moms are supposed to pump.<br /><br />As far as this breast store being a community facility:  I say hogwash. Maybe it started out as a consulting space but it sure looks like a retail store today. Would the owner be willing to stop selling stuff and only hold classes and information sessions? Take out the retail if it isn't retail.<br /><br />And it sickens me to see women turning this into a feminist, gender-discrimnation issue.

It will just switch where the burdens are going to lie.  There are not enough jobs in this country to begin with.  The advances in the telecommunications industry have made it fairly easy for greedy employers who want more profits to outsource American jobs to India and other countries. Many Americans are out of work because of it.  Now, if you make the seniors stay on the job longer, what that means in the long run is there will be even fewer jobs for the younger people, because if the elderly don't retire there is less job turnover. So the young people will be even more vulnerable to problems with unemployment than they are now. In addition, although seniors are living longer, they're still suffering from a lot of age-related problems like arthritis and failing eyesight which will not only potentially make them less effective on the job, and that will hurt the people they are servicing in a variety of ways, but the stress of having to keep working longer can make these age-related problems worse, thereby increasing their needs for medical care, and put them into nursing homes sooner instead of later. It really is a short-sighted plan, typical for the Republicans who never think about where they're going until after they've fallen into the hole and taken us along with them, but I would expect more sense from the Democrats.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3208698, "replies": [], "lft": 214, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/business/economy/in-the-real-world-will-the-jobs-plan-make-a-difference.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4489935, "rgt": 215, "userDisplayName": "Don", "createDate": "1315621823", "userID": 22122679, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1315627818", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1315624218", "commentSequence": 120, "commentBody": "Does any one think if our wages are half of what is now employers will hire more employees?", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3208698, "replies": [], "lft": 220, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/business/economy/in-the-real-world-will-the-jobs-plan-make-a-difference.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4489952, "rgt": 221, "userDisplayName": "mford", "createDate": "1315622162", "userID": 46918499, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1315627818", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Atlanta or something like that", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1315624218", "commentSequence": 112, "commentBody": "The employer tax break might help small and medium businesses.

Also, a classical example of the market not being populated by rational beings. <br/><br/> When a company says: 'I'll hire when the economy gets better and people start spending', it is counting on other companies to hire people, revive the economy, and put paychecks in pockets. It is not, strictly speaking, in any particular company's interest to do hire when the economy is down. But since all companies take this view, no one hires, and the economy continues to stagnate. <br/><br/>Why even listen to them? Pass the law. If no businesses avail of it, fine, federal dollars are saved. However, since it's America, I suspect there are still some businessmen with both sense and wisdom.

Grant was constantly ridiculed for drinking, despite his historic victories and his basic saving of our union.  Alcohol, of course, is a legal, addictive, hard drug, but has avoided those labels.  Most people, my self included, enjoy a drink or two, and have no problem with it.  The problem drinkers are another matter all together.<br/>Winston Churchill, another savior at a key time, was also a legendary drinker.<br/>There was a special documentary on PBS a while back by his granddaughter regarding a tour of America Churchill took as a young man in the early 20th century.

The majority of professionals work closer to 50-60 hours a week compared to the standard 40.  They also get paid the same amount since they are on salary.  This effectively lowers the costs of a company by reducing the number of people they would have to give benefits.  It also has dramatic implications in terms of mental health of the work force.  Both sides are unhappy.  One side struggles to make ends meet and the other struggles to have a personal life.  This factor probably has to do with the decreased power of labor in bargaining, which also contributes to massive pay offs to the higher ups.  It seems like it would solve a lot of problems if we just went back to working a standard amount of time in comparison to regularly working 10 hr days as professionals.<br/><br/>I am young though.  So I am kind of just speculating into what it was like in previous times for work hours, but it seems to make common sense to solve a problem of under and over employment.", "recommendationCount": 874}, {"assetID": 3351093, "replies": [], "lft": 7, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/opinion/keller-inventing-democracy.html", "parentID": 7823636, "commentID": 7823884, "rgt": 8, "userDisplayName": "Mark Thomason", "createDate": "1355116561", "userID": 37674938, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1355116575", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Clawson, MI", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1355116575", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "\"A similar lesson can be learned from our own experience here in the US.

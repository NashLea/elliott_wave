This is absolutely not true. Watch the ESPN 1st and 10 interview I linked below. They speak in present tense about the kind of black players who go to Duke. Instead of reiterating that they no longer regard Duke players this way, they keep trying to build their case by discussing Duke players' backgrounds and saying that Coach K doesn't recruit in Detroit<br /><br />They are given direct opportunities to back away from the term \"Uncle Tom.\" They instead define the term without addressing the question and continue to justify what they said in the past.

I just have a couple of things to say about recruiting and Duke basketball. (By way of background and in the interest of full disclosure, let me just say I was at Duke with Grant and as a member of the student media had the chance to interact with him, the coaches, and his teammates a little more than I might have otherwise. I wrote for the paper and worked with and succeeded Seth Davis, now of <a href=\"http://SI.com\" target=\"_blank\">SI.com</a> and CBS, as the host of \"Cameron Corner\" on Duke's student cable TV station. I also covered ACC recruiting for a couple of years out of college in addition to my \"day job\" as a newspaper reporter.) First off, if I am not mistaken, Grant hosted Chris Webber on Webber's official recruiting visit and Webber turned down Duke's scholarship offer to go to UM. So unless Rose is differentiating his situation from Webber's (which he may very well be) it's difficult to argue that Coach K had no interest in persuading members of the Fab Five to come to Durham. Secondly, I think when people talk about recruiting they need to consider the process as a bit more nuanced than Rose is suggesting. First, they should understand just how it operates as a national (and now international) system that is similar to any other kind of sales or business network. (Though sometimes we see the business aspect become too \"fluid,\" i.e., when envelopes of cash and brokering of AAU and high school players occurs. Re-read _Raw Recruits_ or any sports media outlet over the past 10 years for that matter.) Even though Duke is a \"national school,\" Coach K and his staff at different times are going to have different kinds of relationships in different parts of the country. But beyond this systemic argument, you have to look at the story of EACH recruitment. Otherwise, you cannot determine why Player A may have been offered a scholarship--or been strongly recruited--over Player B. Thirdly, I think it is important to acknowledge that Duke usually does recruit a \"certain type of player\"--one that can help them compete at the highest level of college basketball and, at the same time, have a reasonable chance of thriving as a member of the student body socially and academically. Given the small size of the school (about 6500 undergrads vs. Michigan's 42,000) and the overall academic environment and standards, Duke coaches in all sports (ask Steve Spurrier about this one) have to carefully navigate the admission waters and negotiate and advocate for student-athletes who might not find themselves in the pool of \"solid\" applicants academically (and this situation transcends race). Having said that, I think one thing that no one has mentioned in this discussion (unless it happened on pp 5-16) is that Duke DOES recruit and offer scholarships (and admit) basketball players who meet Jalen Rose's profile, for lack of a better term. I'm not sure Grant's use of Nolan Smith is the best exemplar for this, given his extraordinary circumstances. But, without naming names out of respect for those student-athletes' privacy, I would say that at least during my time at Duke there certainly were basketball players whose parents were not educated at Yale and Wellesley and who did come from (financially) poor, single-parent households and grew up in inner-cities where they developed their skills on playground blacktops, to paraphrase one such player, that were covered with broken glass bottles.

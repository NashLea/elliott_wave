One is the role of religion in government, the other is Santorum's specific political beliefs. Whether he attracts the \"catholic vote\" or not is irrelevant, as are the views of members of the Catholic church. <br/><br/>The fact is a majority of Catholics support abortion rights and contraception.  My guess it that the Church, as opposed to the Bishops, views on gay marriage closely parallel the rest of the country. But the most recent polls I have seen show they also support the death penalty. In other words Catholic beliefs closely parallel the rest of country.<br/><br/>But, as one Bishop has famously said, \"the church is not a democracy\". The only views that matter, in the view of the Bishops, are the Bishop's. Santorum accepts that point of view. That is different than suggesting that Santorum accepts the Bishop's public policy positions carte blanche. <br/><br/>It is also very different than the views of the Puritans who saw the church as a whole as the ultimate repository of God's will to which its leaders were subservient.

Your description of what you call the IPCC/UNFCCC \"ideology\" certainly describes the essence what I call my \"position\" on climate change. (I can't speak for anyone else.)<br/><br/>However, we differ on one important point.  You wrote: \"\u2026and you use science to demand policies\" \u2014 claiming that that's a \"problem.\"<br/><br/>It seems to me that much of science would be useless indeed if it didn't \"demand policies.\" If I'm a spokesperson for National Institute of Health or the Center for Disease Control, and I have scientific evidence that a deadly virus could attack the populace in the foreseeable future, you bet that I'll go straight to Congress and demand policy. It would be totally irresponsible of me \u2014 in fact a dereliction of my duty \u2014 to do otherwise. <br/><br/>No doubt some people would accuse me of being a chicken little, but I would ignore, or, if necessary, contradict them. The stakes would be too high. <br/><br/>Similarly, 98% of the world's climate scientists believe in AGW. Most of them believe it is at least somewhat dangerous and we need to do something about it. Many of them, through their organizations or on their own, try to influence government policy to address the problem. <br/><br/>From their perspective, and mine, It would be totally irresponsible \u2014 in fact a dereliction of duty \u2014 for them to do otherwise. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.ecotecture.com\" title=\"www.ecotecture.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.ecotecture.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 19}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

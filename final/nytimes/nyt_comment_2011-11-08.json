What I've seen here has been astonishing, sometimes even a bit creepy and, well, its almost impossible to truly convey. <br/><br/>People take their babies to pose with the Penn State Nittany Lion statue, to all the statues on campus, to tour the campus, to Penn State games. It's not just an outing or vacation-it's a ritual. People raise their children on Penn State, on blue and white, as if it were cereal or breast milk. Joe Paterno isn't just some coach to them, he's a deity. Penn State isn't just a school to most of the students here. I see it in their eyes, they've been bred to idolize everything Penn State. <br/><br/>This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if this school were the heaven many students have been raised to think it is. Obviously no campus is. It's exactly this upbringing that leads to students not speaking out, not standing up for themselves, not thinking for themselves, to allowing professors and administrators to have more authority than they should. Since I've been here I've seen some corrupt, distasteful, and sometimes criminal things committed by faculty and administrators. <br/><br/>This is a system unchecked and unregulated by outside parties (Penn State virtually owns PA, body mind and soul, especially soul!) with layers of issues. What most people here need most is a broader perspective. It's truly sad because that is exactly what one is suppose to gain when they go off to college. <br/><br/>It's just something to keep in mind, when you ask why this has been allowed to go on, or why the graduate assistant (who believe me was not a \"man\", few of them here are) did not speak up. I understand the people here now, none of this is right and I think there's soon to be a broader sentiment of self betrayal.

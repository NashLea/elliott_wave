The word is the Japanization of the Chinese word know to New Yorkers as \"lo mein.\"  The noodles used are called \"chuka soba,\" \"Chinese soba,\" in Japanese, and all Japanese recognize the dish's origin to be Chinese.<br /><br />That said, ramen is thoroughly Japanese today.  The main topping ingredient in many versions, chashu, is named for Chinese roast pork, cha siu, but it is totally different.  It's prepared from pork belly, not loin, and is boiled, not roasted.  The stocks are unlike any found in China.  Ramen is Chinese only like tempura is Portuguese.<br /><br />The noodle dish of Nagasaki, champon, also comes from China originally, but via Korea.  JJambbong is found in Korea and Koreans in Nagasaki discovered a ready market among foreigners stationed in Nagasaki to study Japan.<br /><br />The noodle trade goes both ways.

In effect, the CDCR is a failure.<br />For one thing, the skills training in California prisons is less than 10%.  It has been estimated that close to 80% of the prison population is illiterate. Thee is no mechanism for promoting literacy, the prison officers have lobbied against the added responsibilities, even at the low level prisons, where they are primarily bed check officers.<br /><br />When a prisoner is released on parole, he/she is required to report to the parole office in the county where they were sentenced. In some cases the unemployment rate in the particular county is much higher than in other counties. However, the parolee is not allowed to leave that county without written permission, and if given, only for short periods.  Even if a parolee has a skill, and could get a job in another county, he/she is not allowed to go to that county without a transfer from the parole office, and has to get approval from the county where the job is. That transfer can not be approved until the job can be verified, and living quarters are approved by that county. In effect, a parolee, can not go to another county to even apply for a job, and if allowed to, then has to wait for approval to transfer. It usually takes 45 to 60 days for that to occur, and by that time, the prospective employer has already filled the job opening.<br /><br />So here we have a case where the parolee has no income, if sentenced for drug sales, can not get food stamps due to a Federal law, and is essentially confined to a county where he/she has no chance to be rehabilitated.<br /><br />The CDCR budget is 8% of the state budget. It costs at least $3500 a year to keep a prisoner incarcerated. Many parolees, simply can not keep from violating parole, just because they have no way to support themselves. The conditions of parole are draconian, also. A parolee can be violated for the most simple things, such as failure to pay a traffic ticket, of if a kitchen knife is found in another room in the house where he is living. In one case, a parolee was violated when an agent found a toy hand grenade in his child's toy box. A parole agent has almost unlimited power, and a parolee will be sent back without any court hearing. In another case, a parolee received a traffic ticket in a different county, and his agent would not let him go to court to pay it. Since he had an outstanding warrant for not paying the ticket, he was sent back.<br /><br />Essentially this system is the prison guards full employment act.

As for Toll Bros. reports, they build luxury homes-- so anything they may have to say about the economy has limited relevance to the total U.S. economic forecast. How is the U.S. manufacturing sector doing in comparison to China's? THAT is the question: orders for durable goods = jobs.

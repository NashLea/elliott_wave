I am uncertain that this is the procedure now followed, though it may be so. Guns in a slaughter house would be an incredible danger and are not less cruel or humane than clubbing.<br/>Here is what I saw: hogs were first clubbed and almost simultaneously their hind legs were grabbed with a hook that was attached to a chain (it was very fast); with their bodies hanging from this chain they were swung carefully so as to be dragged over a large (perhaps 8 or so feet diameter) electrified disk that would basically deliver a fatal or perhaps near-fatal electric shock to them. Alas, I forget whether that step was to ensure they were subdued or to ensure they were dead. Next, their throats were gorged with a large knife to drain their blood. Then (to the best of my recollection) the butchering process began.<br/>The clubbing, hanging, and gorging are ancient slaughter techniques. The electrified disk was a then-modern addition to make all this a bit more humane. I found the entire experience horrifying. It has stuck with me a long time.<br/>I am not sure I buy all these ideas of humaneness (humanity?); but I do believe that skilled clubbing is definitely better, swifter, more effective than a gun.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3410065, "replies": [], "lft": 176, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/opinion/gail-collins-the-down-side-of-reclining.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 12723014, "rgt": 177, "userDisplayName": "V", "createDate": "1409803351", "userID": 23078829, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1409803386", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Los Angeles", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1409799786", "commentSequence": 12723014, "commentBody": "Congress doesn't care about Knee Defenders or airlines packed like sardines because they're beholden to the 1%.<br/><br/>And the 1% definitely doesn't fly coach, so that makes terrible conditions in the back of commercial airliners a non-issue for our lovely politicians.", "recommendationCount": 201}, {"assetID": 3410016, "replies": [], "lft": 34, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/upshot/senate-control-may-turn-on-whos-more-unloved-obama-or-gop.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 12722167, "rgt": 35, "userDisplayName": "Southern Boy", "createDate": "1409794331", "userID": 45428638, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1409803429", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Spring Hill, TN", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1409799829", "commentSequence": 12722167, "commentBody": "Here in Tennessee, I will vote for Lamar Alexander.

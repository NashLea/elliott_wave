Governments repress their people; millions are trapped in poverty while the nation grows rich and wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere. These are differing evils, but they are the common works of man. They reflect the imperfection of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, our lack of sensibility towards the suffering of our fellows. But we can perhaps remember -- even if only for a time -- that those who live with us are our brothers; that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek -- as we do -- nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can.<br/>...<br/>Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change.

Certainly is proportional to ignorance - some philosophers of knowledge may not be surprised! After all, real knowledge, if it existed would have come with some degree of humility and more willingess to learn from others. It is also relevant that the West still controls/shapes the global media. So even Indian journalists working here have to conform to norms dictated by international media - Indian women have to be projected as hapless victims of a reign of terror/patriarchy etc. Many intelligent and confident Indian women have told me that they are revoled by the kind of stereotypes that Western men/women have about them - pitying them and expecting them to be submissive/obedient/ exotic etc etc.  If an Indian journalist in USA wanted to do a story on the abuse of 498A/304B or the progress of women and women leaders in India, the editors would reject his story because it would cause discomfiture among Western readers. (The Economist magazine is a rare Western publication which has balanced coverage of Indian politics and society).

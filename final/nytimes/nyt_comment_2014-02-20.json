It's hard to know what's right.  My child actually seemed to have great powers of concentration at a young age.   But something shifted when she started school, where her energy, curiousity and desire for hands-on learning began to get her in trouble.  Throughout kindergarten, her teacher complained to me at every parent/teacher meeting that she was not raising her hand before speaking, and by the end of the year it was clear that the teacher disliked her for it and that the other students knew it.  Creative minds are always exploring, shifting, imagining, and responding to stimuli.  But school rewards the opposite--performing as instructed, being handed the materials you must work with (and that goes for extracurricular activities as well). I think our educational system is still rooted in an old industrial model and has failed to keep up with the increasingly sophisticated social and emotional environment that children develop within now from the earliest age.  We are still teaching them in ways that are more suited to controlled, obedient dronehood, which is not what our culture is about today.   So you get more kids struggling to stay focused, getting frustrated, being labeled, completely dreading the unchanging routine, and learning to tune things out as a way of coping.

Limit or eliminate some the tolls and the problem of overreach goes away.<br/><br/>The so called EZ-Pass paved the way for repeated toll increases. It should be called EZ-Pay or Quick Access (to your wallet). Because people zip through the tolls without having to pull out the cash, the price increases have occurred at a rapid rate since the introduction of the system. (I don't have the full figures, but I know the tolls now are considerably higher than they were in the past.)<br/><br/>As a frequent visitor with family throughout New York, I pondered for years why citizens put up with paying taxes every time they want to go somewhere. (Tolls are nothing but taxes, paid on the spot.) A partial answer dawned on me: the tolls act as inhibitors of free movement. People in the various jurisdictions don't want others coming their way. (Even the \"public parks\" on Long Island are private.) They want you to stay put. If they pay big bucks to live someplace, they don't want \"riff raft\" having easy access to it. They want exclusion. <br/><br/>A secondary effect of tolls is to make it more difficult for people to find work outside of where they live. Of course, there is the subway, but that doesn't serve every place, all the time. An unemployed person, low on funds, isn't going to search as far and wide as otherwise.<br/><br/>A trip to and from the DC area to NYC now costs more than 60 dollars in tolls.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a> ", "recommendationCount": 59}, {"assetID": 3399657, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/opinion/brooks-the-leadership-emotions.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 11617221, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "Michael", "createDate": "1398139626", "userID": 5340020, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1398139687", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Los Angeles", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1398136087", "commentSequence": 11617221, "commentBody": "Mr. Brooks, you got it right this time!

I'm a college professor in Cabel county. Sure, it's long hours and low pay, but its worth it as some of these kids actually do succeed. They are bright and ambitious, and maybe they could learn a lot from someone so wise as you.

And contrary to ZAW's claim, this article \u2022does\u2022 state the nature of the crimes the condemned were convicted of:<br/><br/>\"Mr. Lockett received the death penalty for the 1999 kidnapping, rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman and Mr. Warner for the 1997 murder and rape of an 11-month-old girl.\"<br/><br/>It's also true, however, that the particular criminal acts these men, or any other defendants, were convicted of, have \u2022no\u2022 bearing on the merits of their claims. They could be the most heinous criminals ever; in our system of justice, they have an absolute right not to be tortured to death. Accordingly, they have a right to relevant information, such as the source and nature of the drugs the state intends to use to kill them, that's necessary for a court to make a reasoned assessment of their claims.<br/><br/>In that regard, ZAW is simply wrong: not only is the nature of their crimes not \u2022important\u2022 in this matter, it's simply irrelevant to the legal question at issue.

Maybe it makes it harder to cast aside any sort of emotion or empathy and think purely on cold, legal terms.  But to ignore the bloody details is to miss half the story.

India has to import oil. If they want to import oil they have to exchange goods and services for it. They can't simply print new rupees and expect to maintain a fixed exchange rate for oil just as other countries can't expect to print currency and exchange them at a fixed rate for dollars in order to pay back dollar denominated debt. <br/><br/>The problem in India is that they built an economy based on cheap energy and cheap credit. India has to import oil. As a result they have to produce something that they can trade to the outside world in exchange for oil. The Indian government has been using cheap credit (QE) to extend oil subsidies to importers to artificially depress the cost of oil in the economy and thereby make their products more competitive. Now that the cost of capital is rising, they can no longer afford those subsidies. The new measures to provide dollar loans to oil importers will just make the situation worse. The RBI is taking dollar savings, giving them to oil companies to buy oil from the global market, taking that oil and running it through the Indian economy to produce products that no one in the world actually wants. As it stands now the Indian economy produces goods from commodities they buy from the global market that are worth less than the sum of their parts (oil+commodities+labor&lt;goods made in China/Germany/Japan/USA).<br/><br/>Get the panic now?", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3381055, "replies": [], "lft": 118, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/mary-cheney-criticizes-her-sister-on-same-sex-marriage/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9871300, "rgt": 119, "userDisplayName": "Linda", "createDate": "1378008083", "userID": 23691631, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1378008127", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Kew Gardens", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1378004527", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "Good for Mary!!!

It\u2019s been fantastic to see the solutions, new questions, and sheer elbow grease people put into the Pilgrim\u2019s Puzzle.<br/><br/>First off, thanks to Gary for the tool at <a href=\"http://www.garyhewitt.net/nyt/pilgrim.html\" title=\"http://www.garyhewitt.net/nyt/pilgrim.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.garyhewitt.net/nyt/pilgrim.html</a>. You can use it to check that any of the following solutions work.<br/><br/>Some people solved the puzzle by noticing that by walking certain loops, it\u2019s possible to adjust the tax the Pilgrim has to pay, which can be very helpful. As Steve Kass pointed out, \u201cOne useful realization was that traversing a tight square by moving S,E,N,W (when there's room) is a way to gain one silver piece, regardless of where you are or how much you owe or are owed.\u201d<br/><br/>Rob used a similar method to produce two solutions that had repeated paths.<br/><br/>Rob\u2019s second solution: \u201cS, S, S, S, then circles the Southwest block four times (resulting in -8), then move E, E, E, E, arriving with 0 debt.\u201d<br/><br/>The shortest such path is 12 blocks long. Ravi gave this solution:<br/>S E N W S S S E E E E S<br/>which has the lovely property of creating a -1 at the starting point rather than a 0, which makes for a much easier beginning.<br/><br/>For those who tackled the nonrepeating version, one approach was to create at least one larger loop. The shortest possible path is 14 roads long, but it is not unique. Readers gave quite a few. These four are from Gary, Tom Enrico, and Ravi:<br/><br/>S,S,S,E,E,E,N,N,W,S,S,S,E,E<br/>S,S,E,E,E,N,N,W,S,S,S,E,E,S\u2028<br/>S,S,E,E,E,N,W,W,S,S,E,S,E,E\u2028<br/>S,E,E,E,N,W,W,S,S,E,S,E,E,S", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3380617, "replies": [], "lft": 102, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/pilgrim/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9871409, "rgt": 103, "userDisplayName": "Daniel Finkel", "createDate": "1378010112", "userID": 61235728, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1378010165", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Seattle, WA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1378006566", "commentSequence": 22, "commentBody": "The longest nonrepeating path we saw was<br/><br/>Here\u2019s one of length 20 from Golden Dragon:<br/>S, E, E, E, S, E, N, W, N, W, S, S, W, W, S, S, E, E, E, E<br/><br/>Gary gave us this snaking path of length 22, which is the reigning champion for longest solution, and has the distinction of being the only solution to begin with E:<br/>E, S, E, E, S, W, W, S, E, E, E, N, N, N, W, W, S, S, S, S, E, E\u2028<br/>I found that it\u2019s also possible to begin with E, E:<br/>E, E, S, S, S, E, E, N, N, N, W, S, W, W, W, S, S, S, E, E, E, E.<br/><br/>At some point, there\u2019s a fair amount of trial and error here. Let\u2019s at least see if we can prove something about the shortest possible solution.<br/><br/>Statement. The shortest path with repetition is length 12.<br/><br/>Proof. The shortest path from NW to SE corner is length 8. In order to be at 0 in column 5, the Pilgrim must be at -2 in column 4, so a negative tax is necessary. If the Pilgrim only took steps to S and E, then she would be at 2 or greater the moment she left the Western side of Duona. This means that minimally, two W or one N (to drop the number below 2) followed by one W are necessary to drop below 0. Each W or N actually adds a total of length two to the total length, since they must be \u201cunwalked\u201d with an E or a S at some point in the future. Hence, the shortest path is length 12.<br/>Incidentally, 2 Ws  is an impossible option in a length 12 solution, since the 2 Es required to allow them to be walked would effectively undue their effect without a N.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3381070, "replies": [], "lft": 130, "assetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/the-arithmetic-of-fantasy-fiscal-policy/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9871410, "rgt": 131, "userDisplayName": "Peter Czipott", "createDate": "1378010160", "userID": 18283368, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1378010165", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "San Diego", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1378006565", "commentSequence": 28, "commentBody": "So Romer had predicted the size of the required stimulus pretty well.

I applaud Mr. Bruni's admiration of his sister in how she fills multiple roles with finesse, effectiveness and humor. What gets difficult is the mix of two different issues: the need for women to have equal pay, deservedly so, and the need to parent alongside of employment. If our society recognized that parenting is a top priority and should be encompassed within a parent's employment role with the deepest respect, perhaps the pay issue would become moot. I think there are many people who feel pressured to sacrifice parenting time because they feel that they have to please employers or the corporate culture with availability in order to be viewed as successful or worthy of advancement. It is important for mothers to be able  to mold their jobs or careers around their parenting preferences and to advocate for ways to be engaged in their employment settings on their terms. This means  not only demanding equal pay but insisting that advancement be determined on merits that are not always related to how much time has been put into the job but on competency and potential for growth.Hopefully, more creative options will continue to emerge as mothers demand more flexible work arrangements that recognize part-time work schedules, parenting commitments, knowledge gained by parenting, and shared job positions, with commensurate rewards for experiences accrued from such endeavors.", "recommendationCount": 12}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

They don't care. They aren't interested. If they have read your endless diatribes on the subject, they are sick of it.\"<br /><br />It goes on to discuss the importance of focusing on domestic needs and charity. While domestic needs are real, and important, the parallels to rhetoric from the late 1930s is chilling. If you replace \"Darfur\" with \"Jews\" or \"Austria\" or \"Poland\" the comments could have just as easily been published in 1938-39. There were many serious domestic needs then as well, and many voices calling for the US to focus on itself.<br /><br />I think in both cases the implication is there is an either/or choice, which is a classic fallacy. Focusing purely on  domestic or global needs are not the only two choices and do not have to be mutually exclusive. Implying the people of Darfur can just \"revolt\" and take care of themselves is as ill-informed as implying all the homeless here have to do is \"get a job.\" The ills of the world are rarely that simple.<br /><br />The US has made good and bad choices in international intervention, and those choices have changed the world in both positive and negative ways. But I would argue that coming along side the suffering men. women, and children of Sudan is as much a moral imperative as coming along side the suffering men, women and children in our own communities and in fact, the US IS serving its own citizens but joining with other countries to help those who cannot help themselves.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1528880, "replies": [], "lft": 544, "assetURL": "http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/oh-what-a-wonderful-day/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2118116, "rgt": 545, "userDisplayName": "Krissy Dietrich Gallagher", "createDate": "1276398353", "userID": 60130387, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1276403250", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Cleveland Heights, OH", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1276399650", "commentSequence": 268, "commentBody": "Thank you, Nicholas, for this column and for all your columns.<br /><br />I believe we could all learn something about how to face cancer, and how to live life, from my not-yet-four-year-old son Austin, who has battled kidney cancer (bilateral Wilms tumor, a rare childhood cancer affecting both kidneys) twice since he was ten months old.<br /><br />When something hurts, he cries then and there, but he never dwells on what's already happened to him and he never worries about what's about to happen to him. And he never ever feels sorry for himself.<br /><br />He has laughed and hopped and jumped and cartwheeled through hundreds of days in the hospital, through six abdominal surgeries, through radiation and chemotherapy (twice). I have spent many an hour maneuvering an unwieldy IV pole over door jambs and around corners as he's raced around the halls on a tricycle at the very moment that chemo is being pumped through his veins.<br /><br />He has giggled contagiously as he lets me attach play-doh horns to his perfectly clean bald head in an attempt to turn him into a triceratops. He has sat patiently through eight-hour blood transfusions, content to watch the construction happening outside his window.  He has honed his toddler flirtation skills on his favorite nurses, calling them endlessly from the button on his bed.<br /><br />I would never wish cancer on anyone and I would certainly never wish cancer upon anyone's child. But there is a special joy in watching a bald and supposedly sick child live every minute to the fullest.

Clarence Page's editorial today speaks to half of that problem. Another side has to do with empowerment of women that started by necessity in World War II (divorce rates peaked when the war ended partly because women found they didn't need a man) it settled down after a couple of years, but peaked in the 70s and 80s as women gained greater prominence in the work place and easy contraception meant they didn't need to be tied down to children. All the while the traditional family has eroded to the point we are today. Even though intensive early childhood education and mentoring are great tools, they will not put the genie back in the bottle. We need to find ways to bring the traditional family back into the projects, removing the penalties for having a working parent in the family, maybe even creating welfare incentives for having a traditional family.

As a retired journalism professor who taught courses in ethics for two decades, as well as having decades of newsroom experience, I know well that ethics is a collision of values, not right-or-wrong.  I have been surprised, in recent years, at the general absence of poltical bias in the Times news columns.  I'm sure having a public editor helps keep reporters and editors more aware of possible ethical breaches.", "recommendationCount": 20}, {"assetID": 1551340, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/opinion/13pubed.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2118071, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "J.H.", "createDate": "1276397014", "userID": 58658378, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1276406810", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1276403210", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "If recollection serves, there was only one matter on which I flat-out disagreed with  you.  That probably means I didn't read everything else with my critical faculties sufficiently engaged.  What I think your columns most often made evident, however, is that agreement or disagreement is not what's most important.  What perhaps mattered most in your work was getting the issues out in the open, sorted and defined, able to be recognized and considered by writers and editors as the same types of issues arise again and again, as they surely will.<br /><br />I won't bother to mention the issue on which I disagreed.  As Mr. Keller pointed out, sometimes one is simply left to disagree.  But I do want to say that I respected enormously your work on the things you mentioned in this last column:  questionable uses of anonymous sources, opinion creeping into news analysis (moreover, it sometimes seems that there is little straightforward \"reporting\" in The Times these days), and preservation of quality on the Internet.

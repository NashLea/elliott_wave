Tiresome these types of comments bemoaning the loss of privilege to have everyone bow in submission to your religious persuasions. Stop contorting the notion that other gain rights that you somehow lose them. Even in Canada we do not see anyone's right to speech being impinged upon. Feeling that you are somehow less tolerated for your point of view does not, in fact, mean that you have suffered the loss of any right.", "recommendationCount": 13}, {"assetID": 3419809, "replies": [], "lft": 303, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/us/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-gays-nationwide-can-marry.html", "parentID": 13858469, "commentID": 13861058, "rgt": 304, "userDisplayName": "J.B.Wolffe", "createDate": "1421466382", "userID": 59309892, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1421471321", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Boston", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1421471321", "commentSequence": 13861058, "commentBody": "Thank you for bringing your views to the open light of day.

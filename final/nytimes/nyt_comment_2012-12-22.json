What being effective does not necessarily mean is being cold, calculating, and adversarial with those you are responsible for leading. In Rex's case, his inability to step away from himself (and those he coaches and manages) and objectively see if what he is doing is working. If it isn't, then he is not being effective. If it is, then he is being effective. <br/><br/>The next step in this process is to evaluate - objectively and dispassionately (and most definitely not with tears in your eyes because you are out of the playoffs) - why things are as they are. If ineffective (as in losing), then answers must be found to problems that exist. However, if effective (as in winning), then an equally vigorous effort must be undertaken to determine why things are going well so that an understanding of where, how, what, who, and why the success has come about. Talent? Good decision-making? Luck?<br/><br/>One can most definitely be humane, considerate, respectful, and caring and still be effective. In other words, there's no need to be heartless, ruthless, etc. to be successful. No need to be \"him or me\". No need to be a Belichick. Just a commitment to success, which is a commitment to being effective.

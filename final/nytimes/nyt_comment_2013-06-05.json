Ironically, as the Times has requested advice for travelling to the city with kids, I have been planning our latest trip (which will occur next week).  On the outset, I would recommend to the Times that they include options for a variety of ages (from babies to teens).<br/><br/>My first piece of advice to families is that they conduct a little (or a lot of) research before setting foot in the city. New York, in addition to being on a mammoth scale as far as the number of options for everything, is always changing. Consider how many attractions (as well as restaurants, subway stations, etc.) were impacted by Superstorm Sandy alone.  For example, we are not able to visit the Statue of Liberty next week because it still hasn't reopened.  But places open and close even without the effects of weather.  So PLAN AHEAD to avoid surprises, or worse with children, disappointment.<br/><br/>I would also recommend buying tickets in advance for attractions, especially if, say, purchasing online does not require stating a specific time and date to visit.  We have visited the American Museum of Natural History twice with our kids, and both times failed to buy in advance.  This meant long waits in line -- an event that children of any age don't need to endure.  I recognize that changes in travel plans could prove costly if you have bought ahead, but it's worth considering.  Despite the wait, our children loved the museum!

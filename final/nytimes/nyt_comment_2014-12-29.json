Maybe especially when the culture they confront isn't all that familiar to readers.<br/><br/>In the past, in some U.S. states, suicide was a felony. I don't know how many states. Some years ago, when I was reading Depression-era newspapers on library microfilm reels, I inadvertently discovered that in Seattle in the 1930s, some of the folks who attempted suicide were arrested. The details were scant, and I can't guess whether the arrests were a form of rescue in desperate times.

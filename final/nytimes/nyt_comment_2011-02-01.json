Kids are always growing, constantly changing, and I think the good parents are those that have enough time with their kids to stay up to speed with where they are and what they need.<br /><br />If you ask me, the biggest threat to that is not the way chores are divided, its the total number of hours per week that the parents are working.  My experience, and observation: As you exceed 70 hrs/wk for one earner, or 100 hrs/wk for 2 earners with childcare arrangements, it gets harder (not impossible, just harder) to stay up to speed with your kids, and its harder to both get in enough downtime so that you come to your kids EAGER to be with them and with enough patience to work through problems as they arise.<br /><br />  ", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 2360745, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/equality-isnt-always-easy/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3319665, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "Al", "createDate": "1296523058", "userID": 29793706, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296538100", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "hollywood beach,ca", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296538100", "commentSequence": 13, "commentBody": "The French sensibly avoid the concept of \"equality\" as in \"everybody doing the exact same thing\".<br /><br />They instead speak of \"\u00e9galit\u00e9\" as in \"everybody has balanced responsibilities and accomplishments\".<br /><br />So if one parent loves to make dinner and the other loves to vacuum and both like to take the kid to the park, then responsibilities are shared and \"\u00e9galit\u00e9\".

A friend of mine (and fellow vacation rental owner) discovered last year that someone had lifted her property's photos and descriptions and put them on Craigslist. Before reporting them to the site and the police, she posed as a traveler and responded to the ad, and the response to her e-mail inquiry included a believable rental contract and very good English. The only indication of a scam was the insistence on wire transfers.<br /><br />Alas, I disagree that this is more likely to affect budget travelers. My friend's property might be a great deal in the Hamptons, but the scammers still stood to make thousands from anyone who fell for it.<br /><br />I should point out that some legitimate rentals still don't accept credit cards, but they are fast becoming the minority. And I agree with all the advice you've given, except perhaps the bit about visiting before you book. Depending on the time of year, I sometimes have to refuse requests for a visit from an inquirer, because our rental is occupied by guests whose privacy I am not willing to intrude. There are honest reasons that a rental owner might refuse a visit.<br /><br />I'm very sorry you got scammed, but thank you for sharing so that others can learn from this. From the other side of the transaction, I can tell you that honest rental owners are delighted to interact with informed travelers.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.experienceburgundy.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.experienceburgundy.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2362665, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/al-jazeeras-egypt-coverage-is-deep-but-hard-to-find-on-tv/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3320034, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Rkthomas13", "createDate": "1296530403", "userID": 11290654, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296538886", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Washington DC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296538886", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "This shows just how cut off even educated Americans are from the Middle East.

I understand radiative transfer.   CO2 is a very effective blanket.  More CO2 emissions is the equivalent of piling on more blankets.  As a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the planet is going to retain a lot (A LOT!) more heat than it would otherwise.   While climate models provide only low to moderate fidelity predictions of where that excess heat will end up (e.g., What fraction to the troposphere?  What fraction to the upper levels of the ocean?  What fraction to the land?  What will happen to atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns?)

Go ahead, move to Texas, you probably will benefit economically, but your descendants? The only thing I'm sure of is that it will be sooner than everyone moving to Texas thinks.

Two years ago against Chelsea in the first leg, Thierry Henry was hauled down inside the box with no penalty given and Michael Ballack should have been sent off and wasn't. In the second leg Barca was playing a man down because Anelka dove and got Abidal sent off. In last years Inter match, Diego Milito was two yards offside when he scored Inter's second goal. Had that goal been properly disallowed Barcelona, not Inter, would have advanced to the final. Ironically, Mourinho had nothing to say about that officiating mistake. This year against Arsenal, Messi had a goal disallowed in the first match that was clearly onsides. In the second match the ref missed a clear penalty for Barcelona when Messi was tripped from behind and somehow decided not send Koscielny off for what should have been a second booking. In the latest league Clasico, Mourinho had no problem with the soft penalty on Alves or the no-call when Casillas took down David Villa in the penalty area. Barcelona gets victimized by bad decisions just as much as any other team. However, unlike other teams they are often able to overcome them because of their proactive style of play. Mourinho's tactic tonight was to have his players kick their way to a 0-0 draw and then hope to get lucky in the second leg in the form of an own goal or penalties. This is the same tactic that backfired on Arsenal in February. Much like Mourinho, Arsene Wenger tried to claim he had been cheated out of a victory despite Arsenal being unable to get a single shot on goal. It seems these clubs and their fans want to cherry-pick the decisions that didn't go their way and ignore the ones that did so they don't have to admit the truth - that their teams are know they can't match Barcelona ( even in their own grounds ) so they play with 11 defenders and hope Barca's bus breaks down on the way to the match.", "recommendationCount": 22}, {"assetID": 2672452, "replies": [], "lft": 142, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/technology/28apple.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3747947, "rgt": 143, "userDisplayName": "vc", "createDate": "1303965336", "userID": 52260578, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303965604", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new england", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303962004", "commentSequence": 53, "commentBody": "this is a misleading headline. especially, given the context of this week's (messy, inaccurate, and impatient) hype. in that context, it is be easy to read the headline as implying that apple has acknowledged (in retrospect) that a choice they had made previously was a mistake or a wrong decision and that the choice must have involved an intention to utilize the location data of its iphone users (not accurate) without their consent (not accurate), or some other nonsense that's been zooming around in the gossip mill called technology news \"journalism\". such implications only stoke the controversy. if you have an iphone or any smart phone, please realize that much more significant personal information (than the aggregated wifi tower locations) is recorded everyday by you yourself in your own phone's address book (your friends' contact information!), email accounts (all of your correspondences, e-statements, sometimes even account passwords!), and calendars (who you've been meeting with and where!). many of you (us) even choose not to use the option of password protecting their phones. if an iphone gets \"into the wrong hands,\" you've just given away an awful lot of your privacy. in that case, you'll be thankful for another type of client-server exchange of information between iphone and apple that will save your hide: it's called RemoteWipe and it's available to iPhone users. it may be time for customers to read a bit more (on the apple website) to learn about the technology and features of the phone that they've bought. it might just keep them from wasting their time reading posts like these!

How about appointing a Unitarian Universalist \"chaplain\" (or whatever this role is called)? Unitarian Universalism does not have a creed. It completely lacks dogma, whether theistic or atheistic. Many freethinkers, including atheists and agnostics, feel at home - and are fully recognized and respected - in Unitarian Universalist congregations.\r<br/><br/>While Unitarian Universalism does not have a creed, it does follow seven principles:<br/>\n*** The inherent worth and dignity of every person;<br/>\n*** Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;<br/>\n*** Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in their congregations;<br/>\n*** A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;<br/>\n*** The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within their congregations and in society at large;<br/>\n*** The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all;<br/>\n*** Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2671907, "replies": [], "lft": 242, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/magazine/mag-01KillTeam-t.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3747930, "rgt": 243, "userDisplayName": "Sabra", "createDate": "1303964925", "userID": 42867197, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303967511", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Colorado", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303963911", "commentSequence": 76, "commentBody": "Having served 5 years on active duty as a commissioned officer, with one tour in Vietnam, I find it preposterous to beleive that we can deploy our troops on multiple combat tours of duty in an asymetrical war and not expect an outcome similar to that of the 3rd Platoon.

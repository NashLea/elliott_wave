Depending on a student's priorities, school can either be very important or meaningless. Nevertheless, a student who is willing to put in hard work is significantly different than a student who is putting off studying. Thus, Common Core can allow a number of students thrive, while a number of students drastically collapse. This is due to the fact that Common Core is harder. Conversely, it is a different story for students with learning dissabilities. Even before Common Core, this group of students had struggled with surviving school. Therefore, Common Core exceeded their capabilities to the extent, leaving them hopeless. Since teachers have been using old methods for a number of years, it can be said that this transition is not an easy one for them either.

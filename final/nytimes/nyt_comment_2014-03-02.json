How confident they are they can  manipulate the press and the public.<br/><br/>Senator  Richard Burr (R-NC), the top Republican on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, said after the vote, \"We're sort of fooling ourselves to believe that this drives the election issue list.\" Clearly, our veterans did not make this \"list.\" <br/><br/>Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama won the prize for rank hypocrisy when he stated, \"We're going to do the right things for the veterans of America\" and then voted to block the legislation.<br/><br/>For those who run for office to serve the common good,  such behavior has to be hard to bear.

The last one passed away this month, aged 99. He was apparently interviewed quite regularly about the ability of the broadcast to scare people. The NYT obit has some nice lines about how massively non-credible the thing was. <br/><br/>But he had another claim to fame: He was the regular customer of Sardi's who had been going there the longest. The original Sardi used to let him run a tab, because the theater business can be fickle. At one point, the guy had a steady job at the place next door to Sardi's, which lacked a toilet. So their acquaintance was helpful there as well.<br/><br/>I will believe that he was the Sardi's regular who had been going there the longest, but I'm sure the Times was wrong on what year he began going there. (Check NYT Corrections pages; they almost always have to correct simple facts in obits. For example, the NYT wedding announcement for Morley Safer's daughter said she was keeping the name Safer; but in his obituary, NYT used a different surname for her. The Correction blames CBS for the error.)<br/><br/>The guy went to college in Pittsburgh, then came to NYC; but NYT says he'd gone to Sardi's for 82 years.<br/><br/>Anyway, one play staged by Mercury Theater in 1938 was \"Too Much Johnson\".

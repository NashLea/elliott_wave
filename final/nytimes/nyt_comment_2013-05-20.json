While statistically people without college educations earn less, there are many jobs that require skills, rather than degrees, that pay in the range of 60 to 200 thousand a year. The key is for people to find a foothold in an industry or business that offers a pathway up and then progress over a period of years. Also, many employers seeking specific skills and abilities will allow the substitution of experience for a four year degree. The idea that those without college should consign themselves to a lifetime of poor pay is just wrong.<br/><br/>Consider, also, this: we have become biased in favor of those with degrees. This enables employers to set a minimum standard of a four year degree simply based on the assumption that someone without one might be of lower intelligence and can't stick to a task consistently enough to get a degree. <br/><br/>Employers in turn use the \"no degree\" excuse to reduce pay for those doing similar or the same work, so the lack of a degree statistically shows up as a lagging indicator of pay simply because of this discrimination. Employers leverage their power against employees.<br/><br/>The best way to attack income inequality is to pay people more for the value they bring, degreed or not. Unions are one way. Mass public insistence on greater fairness on pay scales is another.

It is not pointless.  Subjective it may be, but the subjective views of the majority count in a democracy.  Just because a view is subjective does not make it wrong or pointless.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the author's views are not wholly subjective--they are indeed supported by facts.  Several undeniable objective facts: <br/><br/>1. Unions are weaker today then in the past.<br/>2. Income equality exists between the highly educated and the less educated.<br/>3. The way income is distributed in this country \"unfair\".  By any definition--you choose, or let your neighbor choose, what unfair means, but this unfairness is a fact.<br/><br/>Reviving unions may not be the answer.  I personally believe giving everybody college educations is not the answer.  Finding a way to preserve dignity within an uneducated life would be good.  Having the haves of the country feel a responsibility to the have-nots of the country would be good.  Changing our priorities as a nation will be absolutely necessary.  What makes us proud to be an American should not be viewed within the context of our strength and wealth but rather our caring and goodness of our lives.  We can't be proud when so many of us are so poor or working so hard or are so worried as to make the pursuit of happiness a moot point."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 9034148, "replies": [], "commentID": 9034241, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Eric Norstog", "createDate": "1369028306", "userID": 25270353, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1369063304", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Gort", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Oregon", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1369059704", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Allow me to define basic fairness as compensation for all persons engaged in social endeavor sufficient to provide housing, sustenance, clothing, and time and opportunity for recreation.

They're two separate points.  Fairness is subjective.    Is it it unfair that a top hedge fund manager pays $150 million per year in federal taxes while a person in the lower 50% pays nothing in federal taxes.  Or is it unfair that a top hedge fund manager has so much in disposable income and a person in the lower 50% has none?    Depends upon your perspective. <br/><br/>Fairness is pointless because, as a political argument, it doesn't work.  The argument has been made repeatedly since the Reagan cuts, and the gap has widened ever since. <br/><br/>Fairness is pointless because it obscures the hard and important questions of how much money to spend on the various programs and how to raise that money.  The fairness issue is a cheap gimmick by politicians of both parties. <br/><br/>As for income equality existing between the highly educated and the less educated, that is true and undeniable.  But what is also true and undeniable is that income inequality is far greater between the doctors and lawyers who are in the bottom top 1% and the hedge fund managers who are in the upper top 1%. All are highly educated, yet the gap is far greater than that between a doctor and a Walmart cashier.

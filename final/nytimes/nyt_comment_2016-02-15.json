Nor would I be surprised if such an allegation were delivered by Marco Rubio who just this weekend found a way to blame former President Clinton for the attacks on 9/11.  And, of course, Ted Cruz took it upon himself to lead the charge against the Senate even considering any of the President's potential nominees to fill Mr. Scalia's position.  So little time had elapsed between the announcement of the Justice's death and the launching of this latest Cruz missile that one might have been forgiven for assuming that the Senator had simply jumped the gun again as per his staffers' contention that Ben Carson had put his presidential campaign on \"hold\" (did Cruz even wait for the last rites to be performed?). Naturally, these are the same people who so admired Justice Scalia for his (supposedly) adhering to every syllable and particle of punctuation to be found in the Constitution.  On the other hand, President Obama's insistence on exercising his constitutional authority to nominate new justices to the highest office in the land doesn't impress them quite so much.

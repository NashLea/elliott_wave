There has been a particularly toxic positive feedback loop between climate science and policy and politics, whose direction has arguably been reversed as result of Climategate.<br /><br />The scientists provided the initial impulse for this feedback loop back in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s.  The enviro advocacy groups quickly saw the possibilities and ran with it, with the scientists\u2019 blessing.   The enviro advocacy groups  saw the climate change issue as an opportunity to enlist scientific support for their preferred energy policy solution. Libertarian think tanks, the traditional foes of the enviro advocacy groups, began countering with doubts about the science.  International efforts to deal with the climate change problem were launched in 1992 with the UNFCCC treaty.<br /><br />Wait a minute, what climate change problem?  In 1992, we had just completed the first IPCC assessment report, here was their conclusion:  \u201cThe size of this warming is broadly consistent with predictions of climate models, but it is also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability.  . . The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect from observations is not likely for a decade or more.\u201d<br /><br />Nevertheless, the policy cart was put before the scientific horse, justified by the precautionary principle.  Once the UNFCCC treaty was a done deal, the IPCC and its scientific conclusions were set on a track to become a self fulfilling prophecy.  The entire framing of the IPCC was designed around identifying sufficient evidence so that the human-induced greenhouse warming could be declared unequivocal, and so providing the rationale for developing the political will to implement and enforce carbon stabilization targets.   National and international science programs were funded to support the IPCC objectives.  What should have been a political debate about energy policy, environmental quality, and reducing vulnerability to weather and climate disasters, became a debate about the nuances of climate science, with climate scientists as the pawns and whipping boys.<br /><br />So were the scientists innocent victims and pawns in all this?  Were they just hardworking scientists doing their best to address the impossible expectations of the policy makers?  Well, many of them were.  However, at the heart of the IPCC is a cadre of scientists whose careers have been made by the IPCC.  These scientists have used the IPCC to jump the normal meritocracy process by which scientists achieve influence over the politics of science and policy.  Not only has this brought some relatively unknown, inexperienced  and possibly dubious people into positions of influence, but these people become vested in protecting the IPCC, which has become central to their own career and legitimizes playing power politics with their expertise.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bit.ly/91rWVc\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/91rWVc</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 12}, {"assetID": 2031991, "replies": [], "lft": 102, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/the-real-threat-to-science-in-the-new-political-climate/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2789036, "rgt": 103, "userDisplayName": "Phil", "createDate": "1288838273", "userID": 56609855, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1288843487", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Santa Cruz, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1288839887", "commentSequence": 47, "commentBody": "I'm not sure why you recommended the blog piece by David Roberts, Andrew.

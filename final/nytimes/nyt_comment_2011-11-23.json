Huntsman, seemingly intelligent and knowledgeable of many foreign topics, has advocated more drone strikes in Pakistan. Not saying what he is trying to accomplish. To kill all Muslims we feel are terrorist? Must be something that rubbed off from President Obama, as Obama's Ambassador to China.\r<br/><br/>Newt Gingrich, in his wisdom, announced that if the Pakistani leadership cannot control the radical Muslims in their own country, said...\"They should get out of the way\"...letting us go in and do the job for them. It is strangely similar to what candidate Obama said in a debate, that as president he would go into Pakistan with military might to fight the terrorist problem in their country. He is doing just that with his unmanned drones, and the terrorist threat is growing.\r<br/><br/>It is not hard to understand that the drone attacks create more new terrorist than those we are killing. The more drone attacks, the more newly motivated terrorists grows exponentially. The mastermind of 9/11 is dead...yet we perpetuate his very existence with the drones.\r<br/><br/>Newt Gingrich,again, the newly heralded Romney alternate said...he would bomb Iran, if everything else failed in stopping them from making a nuclear bomb, soley ,with the intent to cause regime change. \r<br/><br/>There is a power struggle in that part of the Muslim World...a Sunni, Shia thing...we are becoming dangerously involved in their internal disputes. A note of warning came from Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan, when he said...if there was a Pakistani war against America, he would side with Pakistan. Our shortsighted policies in that area could unite the Shiites and the Sunnis...an Islamic coalition...an Osama bin Laden dream come true.\r<br/><br/>President Obama has failed miserably in soothing tensions in the Middle East and now in Northern Africa...it seems that now, some of the Republican candidates are prone to follow Obama's lead.

Not on your life.<br/><br/>At times, it's just not worth the effort.

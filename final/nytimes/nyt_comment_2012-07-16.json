I worked for the federal government as a research scientist for 20 years and learned that, at the very least, FDA, USDA-ARS, APHIS, EPA, USGS, and DOE are internally notorious for censoring science.   Federal scientists do not have tenure or academic freedom in the same way academic scientists do, and there is often a political agenda for certain kinds of data.  Scientists have been fired for drifting into the realm of \u201csensitive topics\u201d in the natural course of pursuing their assigned scientific quarry.  Going off-message or off-topic is not tolerated well.  Labs that tend to produce disappointing data (by that I mean, the data does not support the political agenda) are often placed on closure lists when budgets are cut.  In the interest of stewarding taxpayer resources (funds used to pay for research) and protecting public safety (consequences of not knowing the truth), there should be a firewall between federal scientists and politicians that prevents political censorship.

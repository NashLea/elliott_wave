I give him some tylenol, and his fever goes away, but he dies soon afterward. My study would have two very different outcomes depending on whether I used fever or death at my outcome of choice. If we chose fever as the outcome, then the tylenol successfully \"cured\" the patient, as the fever went away. If we chose death as the outcome, then the opposite is true.<br/><br/>In the same way, this study has shown that there is at least a transient change in parameters in some patients. What is the significance of this in terms of clinical outcomes like stroke or heart attack? We don't know as this was not investigated. It could very well be that the groups are identical and this represents a fluke. Alternatively, perhaps these researchers have identified an interesting new aspect of the physiological response to exercise worthy of further follow up.<br/><br/>For now, I'd sum it up as this: they have looked at a relatively small group of people (the standard for cardiac studies is tens of thousands of patients) and made an extremely provocative conclusion. The onus is now on the research community to confirm, repeat, and expand on this experiment.

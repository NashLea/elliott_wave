The Princess of Wales is not wearing a tiara of Romanov provenance.  She is wearing what is called the \"Cambridge Lover's Knot Tiara,\" one that was commissioned in 1914 by Queen Mary who, in a nostalgic vein, wanted to recreate the lover's knot tiara that belonged to her grandmother, Princess Augusta of Hesse. Originally each knot was surmounted by an oval pearl to mirror each drop below but by 1935 it was simplified to its present form. Queen Mary passed it to her granddaughter Queen Elizabeth who in turn presented it to Diana upon the occasion of her marriage to Prince Charles.<br /><br />You are confusing this with another tiara (the one with Russian provenance), which is known as the Grand Duchess Vladimir Tiara.\"  That tiara (not pictured with this story) was commissioned by the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia in 1890, and  consists of fifteen interlaced diamond circles each centered by a swinging teardrop pearl. After the Bolshevik Revolution the Grand Duchess and her jewels narrowly made it out of the country. When the Duchess died in 1920 the tiara passed to her daughter Helen who was by then Princess Nicholas of Greece. In 1921 Princess Nicholas sold the tiara to Queen Mary and it has been with the Windsors ever since, passing to Queen Elizabeth in 1953. It is a perennial favorite and the pearls can also be changed out with emerald drops (Queen Mary devised this with the remaining unmounted Cambridge emeralds, which you also referenced \"wearing like a squaw\" in the story).

It is true that it will be difficult for some climate change harms to separate harms that would have happened to people anyway and harms that are attributable to human action. However not all climate change harms are plagued by this problem.  For instance, we have a pretty good idea how much glacier retreat and consequent reduction in surface water, sea level rise, and increases in vector borne disease are attributable to human causation. Justice would require those who are causing these harms shoulder some of the burden for the damages. For those problems which are more difficult to separate human and natural causation, rules of thumb based upon probability can be developed. This is actually done in tort litigation frequently. As far as other inevitable conflicts over adaptation monies are concerned, institutional fixes will be required which look at just procedures for making tough decisions.<br /><br />Donald A.

(Yes, there is no oil in Afghanistan, but the West wanted a pipe through it and it's a pretext to be militarily established in the places with oil, or next to them). So arguably, the West is much more corrupt than Karzai, and I am sure he, and many others believe that. So the joke is on the West; at corrupt, corrupt and a half.<br />Literal Islam is an automatic prop for fascism.<br />As the Qur'an says:<br />\"Allah wants us to obey whoever detains power: \"O YE WHO BELIEVE! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and OBEY THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN POWER.\" (Quran's fascist principle, Sura 4; verse 59).\"<br />Thus the power of power is considerably boosted. And power is its own justification, and that, not just in a political, but religious sense. This in turns props corruption, because the fascist leaders know that they may have just a few moments in the sun, before having themselves and their family accused of being unbelievers, and running for their lives. So Obama can say whatever he wants. Karzai knows that any other Afghan leader would do exactly as he does, so the Americans and their European poodles have nobody else to choose from (except some as Hekmaktiar, who would hate them more, and are really deadly).<br />There is no way out, but to drop the whole pretense, and promote a constitution that would allow to regroup the secular forces (which used to rule, 40 years ago).<br />PA<br /><a href=\"http://patriceayme.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://patriceayme.wordpress.com/</a><br />", "recommendationCount": 48}, {"assetID": 1449587, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/how-will-hospice-care-change/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1972318, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "ResponsibleDevelopment", "createDate": "1273596035", "userID": 35274016, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1273642737", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Harrison, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1273639137", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "The bill did contain a reimbursement cut for hospice of about 0.3% per year", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1445941, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/will-insurers-be-required-to-cover-my-familys-costs/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1972871, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "CUDIVA", "createDate": "1273604258", "userID": 60145077, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1273642737", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Albuquerque, NM", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1273639137", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "It's strange that you ask if they have health coverage, since a high deductible health insurance plan is required in order to contribute to a HSA.

Should they not undertake the paperwork required by the secretary, the states, the countless bureaucracies this law creates, hospices will see their reimbursement 2% for each report they fail to produce. So, is our trillion dollars being well spent on paperwork instead of patients- apparently the democrats thought so.<br /><br />Other cuts will hospices face won't be known till 2013, when (according to the text in the law) \"not earlier than October 20 1, 2013, the Secretary shall, by regulation, implement revisions to the methodology for determining the payment rates for routine home care and other 23 services included in hospice care\"<br /><br />Who can take care of you in the hospice?  Well, don't ask your own personal doctor, the law empowers mid-level practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants to run hospices. Reimbursement is mandated to be \"budget neutral\" so if the hospice uses a physician, who generally gets more money (after all, they went to school for 4-8 years and many graduate with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt) that will require the hospice to cut somewhere else. When 'the secretary' decides how much to pay professionals for a hospice visit, it'll be based at a nurse pay scale, not a doctors.<br /><br />So, we can expect lots of changes, as the secretary has all kinds of discretion to set up demonstration programs, define what services are and are not covered, and decide who'll be allowed to start and run new hospice programs. The secretary has 3 years, so let's ask this question again later. For now, facilities are worried they may not meet the requirements that'll come in 2013, and they're concerned the doctors and other professionals providing care may be replaced by entitlement-school graduates with much less experience and training.

Regular health checkups, vaccinations, screenings, and preventive care are not unforseen events.  This is not the purpose for which insurance should be used.<br /><br />We have an entrenched belief in this country that \"fee for service\" medicine is the best of all possible worlds.  But this is self-defeating.  Doctors do not earn money off healthy people, so why should they be interested in preventive medicine?  Doctors earn money by treating the sick, and performing procedures for which they can charge a lot of money.  This may sound cynical, but if you examine the economics of medicine as practiced in this country, you will find that it is true.  Why else do doctors gravitate to the most expensive specialties instead of toward preventive or family medicine?  Because there's no money in it.<br /><br />We should instead be framing the question in a way that asks how best to keep people healthy, and to treat those who are sick.  When Henry Kaiser organized his then-revolutionary health-care plan for his employees, he was villified by fellow businessmen and doctors alike.  It was socialized medicine, it was giving something to workers they didn't need to have, it would cause them to become lazy, and a host of other objections.<br /><br />But it made good business and health care sense.  Workers contributed a modest five or ten cents a week to the plan, and in return they were treated by doctors on the company payroll who offered advice on how to prevent illness and injury, and kept the workforce healthy by keeping small problems from turning into big ones.  Catastrophic problems were dealt with as needed, at no extra cost.  Thus was the first HMO in this country born.<br /><br />If we focused more on this model, rather than insurance, which is a risk model, we would be able to have a better discussion on how to meet the health *care* needs of people, rather than their health *insurance* needs.<br /><br />This country is crying out for primary care physicians, nurse practioners, and physicians' assistants.  The need is even greater in rural areas.  We need to develop a health care delivery model that will enable these medical professionals to earn an income much more commensurate with their real value to society.<br /><br />People who decry this as socialized medicine, or worse, as \"rationing\" don't really understand that there is already rationing, severe rationing, and that people die from such rationing.  Your insurance company drops you because you now require cancer treatments.  So long, glad we got your money while you were healthy, we're no longer responsible for you.  And then what happens?  Nobody else will take you on, so you use all your savings, then go bankrupt, and die anyway in the end.  But this isn't rationing, is it?  You need to see a doctor today, do you?  Well, you call one doctor, and his practice is closed, you are referred to another, and the same story is repeated.  I needed immediate care for a severe case of strep throat when I worked in Manhattan several years ago.  I went through five doctors before I could find one who could see me at all, much less that day.  I had to wait two days and, naturally, my condition deterioriated.  As a Kaiser member, I could have called my personal physician and been seen that day.  If her appointments were full, I could be seen in the walk-in clinic in the evening, by a doctor who would have access to my full medical records.  But this wasn't available to me there and then.  Never again will I venture into the \"fee for service\" medicine area.<br /><br />Administrative overhead is another reason health care is so expensive.  If insurance companies weren't so busy denying claims, refusing coverage, and weeding out the truly sick from their rolls, they wouldn't need so many administrators.  Overhead at some insurance companies runs to 40% or more.  No, insurance is not the model we should be using, not even with the reforms.<br /><br />Single-payer is an idea whose time has definitely come, but people get hysterical even considering it, and many lies are put about (rationing, death panels, and so on).  At least develop a standard form for all medical reports, and have everyone use it.  I have to supervise the health care of a family member who is not in Kaiser.  Every time we go to the doctor, there's another form, on a clipboard, that we must fill in.<br /><br />As an IT security professional I understand the issues of privacy and security, but there must be a way to ensure that a patient's complete medical history is available to an attending physician.  This could avoid conflicting diagnoses and medication.  But this won't happen in an insurance-oriented health-care system.  Good luck, folks.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1452621, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/opinion/12wed1.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1974681, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "JimF", "createDate": "1273631939", "userID": 53056169, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1273643371", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Los Altos, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1273674553", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Just as all problems with politicians start with voters, you're missing the key problem here -- Americans want dirt-cheap gas and oppose everything that would make the price of gas for their cars remotely match the true cost to society of using it, because they want something for next-to-nothing.<br /><br />They want to drive by themselves, in a huge SUV, commuting 70 miles roundtrip to work, using $3-a-gallon gas, because it's in the constitution that they can.<br /><br />We can have safer off-shore drilling -- by raising the cost of gas.

Pre-planning was the key. I did a fair bit of online research to make sure I knew the most efficient way to get from the airport to the hotel in each of nine destinations. Most were nice and cheap (trains from airport to and from downtown in Hong Kong, Paris, London), almost all the rest were taxis, which were fast and not tooexpensive (Cairo, Singapore, Istanbul, Bruges) and one wonderfully expensive private water taxi direct to my hotel in Venice (had to do it). Main thing for me was maximizing my time on the ground in each destination, and knowing in advance not only the how but the where and how often of the airport transportation made a huge difference. <br/><br/>Detailed planning is critical for round the world travel. Almost as important: being flexible, changing your plans where needed and making the most of every stop by checking local maps and guides (particularly transportation options) in advance of your arrival. \u201cKnow before you go\u201d is a well-worn phrase, but, on a trip like this, it made all the sense in the world!<br/><br/>A final note on jet lag, or lack of it. A lot of my traveling is walking, sightseeing and being out and about. Despite the time differences, my first priority was getting out and seeing things. No matter how tired I was, I pushed myself to observe local time for my eating and sleeping cycles. It worked really well. I was never overly tired or disoriented, nor did I have any trouble sleeping; I was out like a light every night! <br/><br/>Read more and see tons of pics from the trip in my book for iPad: Around The World In 18 Days.

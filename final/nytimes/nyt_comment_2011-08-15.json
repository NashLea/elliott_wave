This applies even within some newspaper and media corporations, as astonishing as that might sound. <br/><br/>Human beings have feelings, human beings have souls, human beings have compassion. Corporations have none of these things. Many modern corporations are antithetical to these human qualities; all they care about is the bottom line, money money money. And all the people within the corporations care about is power, security and money. There are some decent corporations, of course, if they have decent leadership.<br/><br/>So it is ironic that precisely those politicians professing Christian, family values would be so devoted to serving such a soul-less beast.<br/><br/>Corporations are people? Perhaps, if the people you are referring to have no souls. I think the politicians serving these corporate beasts have sold their souls.

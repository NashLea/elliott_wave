Any investment a company makes to reduce carbon emissions will have both an immediate negative impact on its bottom line with the results benefiting its competitors.  We will have to move beyond capitalism to a new global economic system that rewards process over profits.  We have to develop a new metric that assigns prosperity to processes that reduce carbon emissions instead of just making the cheapest goods.  Otherwise, there is no mechanism in pure capitalism to create the incentives for these kinds of investments.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this is global problem.  We will have to develop trade organizations that dictate where we import goods from based upon associated carbon.  Price can no longer be the sole factor.<br/><br/>A carbon tax is insufficient as it is a negative incentive that can be overcome with higher profits.  We must move to a global system that gives preferential treatment to processes that reduce carbon regardless of profit.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking outside the box here toward a permanent solution.  So long as the cheapest energy rules, carbon fuels will reign supreme.  All governments will have to get involved to develop a positive incentive based trade system to reduce emissions.  <br/><br/>If Coca-Cola and others really want to help, they must use their financial clout to get politicians elected that will move toward these goals.

For one, it takes me back a few decades when I was in charge of picking the video (it was the 80s) a group of us was going to watch.  At the store, I deliberated long and hard between a film I\u2019d seen recently and thought was great and a \u201csure-thing\u201d blockbuster.  I couldn\u2019t decide, so I rented both, figuring if they hated my first choice, I had a back-up.  Ten minutes into \"Babette\u2019s Feast,\" my friend Mick turned to me and said, \u201cIs anybody going to do anything other than make soup from dried fish?\u201d  I knew I\u2019d lost them and popped in \"Die Hard.\"<br/><br/>Dargis and Scott\u2019s column also reminds me of a conversation I once had with my dad, who came in the room when I was home on break from college and asked what I was reading.  I think it was \"Portrait of a Lady\" by Henry James.  If you\u2019re familiar with it, you know it\u2019s a novel in what what happens is not nearly as important as what the central character thinks about what is happening to her.  After trying in vain to make it sound \u201cinteresting\u201d to him, I added that I was reading it for the second time.  \u201cWhy would you read a book twice?  Don\u2019t you remember what happened the first time?\u201d  The conversation went downhill from there.<br/><br/>Truth be told, not every art film appeals to me, and I do enjoy movies were things blow up on ten-minute intervals.  But the films that have stayed in my memory the longest have always been those that attempted something fresh, either in a narrative or in a visual sense.

Did you give up your salary, pension and health benefits? How about that public paid for car, lunch, mansion, secretary, security detail, vacation, etc? <br/><br/>\"Frankly, the proposal is generous. The state should do away with all pensions, as that is the major contributor to the budget crisis. <br/><br/>Long term pensions had nothing to do with the HOUSING market bubble, Wall St banks etc. Stop using false info to get support for your politics #8 \"Annie\".<br/><br/>\"I don't know of any private company that provides pensions for its employees and most only contribute minimally to a 401(k) or similar plan. \"<br/><br/>About 5% in the US as of 2010 still do. That is sad; everyone who works should one day retire. 401k plans are not pensions; they are low tax accounts for business executives- they were never intended to be pensions. They're 100% unreliable. THAT was the first thing to disappear in 2008 because is no market security. Many people who saved all their lives now can't retire. Do you want millions of old people to be homeless? Then you'll call them \"lazy\". <br/><br/>\"Let state workers save for themselves like the rest of us 'working class' in the private sector.\"<br/><br/>What do you think pensions plans are? DO you think NY State just gives it to them for free? Those workers have to contribute that money, and it is invested and held for years. It's a safe, effective and long term form of investment that is very stable (as long as it's managed properly). If civil service employees aren't 'working class', then who is???<br/><br/>Why is there no money in NY? The big businesses pay very little in corporate tax; those bail outs went to make those banks even bigger, and they've got record profits. They're located on Wall St. Instead you guys blame some state worker earning 30k or so a year (many earn less), and not all even have permanent status.<br/><br/>Business rob you blind you and you blame a few city/state employees. I'd insult you but I know that you are a paid consultant - along with a few others here - who write these comments here to manipulate people.<br/><br/>For the record, I'm not a state/city employee. I wouldn't want a job as difficult as the one those people have.<br/><br/>As #11 pointed out by quoting this article there is a lot of nonsense here, \"This bill institutes common-sense reforms to bring government benefits more in line with the private sector while still serving our employees and protecting our retirees.\u201d<br/><br/>Common sense? The private companies rob their employees daily, and have already taken all their rights. Ever heard of the ILO? The right to strike? To form a union? They'll convince you that you've got no rights. They are UN guaranteed conventions. Even people in Egypt &amp; Haiti &amp; Bolivia stood up and fought for those things. Americans at one time did. Say in the 1880's with national strikes (and many were massacred by the security/military); the 30's saw similar things, and many workers were killed for it. You guys are totally ignorant &amp; that is why you get robbed by business.<br/><br/>Guess what? When the public workers are on par with the private sector (ie. nobody has pensions etc), YOU are all going to suffer &amp; get even less. Then nobody will have a pension, medical insurance etc. Nobody will be allowed to form a union etc. You might as well just make yourselves slaves and repeal the 13th amendment. INSTEAD&lt; you should all work together to DEMAND that EVERYone, private worker or not, get a pension, medical, union, right to strike etc.<br/><br/>Fight each other like the Governor &amp; big business want and you will fail. If you, on the other hand, realise that the Wisconsin Gov Walker, this clown in NY and the others are all cronies of the banks etc, then you will be closer to protecting your own rights. The overt propaganda in the Times today is what they usually spew. Anti-union, anti-people rubbish. <br/><br/>If you don't like the way unions are run, then try to fix them or change the management. No unions means you have no political voice. Here's another braniac who says raise the age from \"65? How about 72!!! People live much longer now\"<br/><br/>The average person is not living longer; that is a false argument. It is a small segment of the population that live longer. You're being manipulated with that argument.  <br/><br/>As Rousseau said, \"It does not behove slaves to reason about freedom\". Americans TALK about freedom and nothing more. Unless you join your brothers, instead of fighting them like tools of the governour, you'll lose everything. You'll be a slave and be rewarded justly. <br/><br/>Peaceful demonstrations; organising; education; solidarity etc - these concepts are foreign to Americans these days.

Thank God for Harmony. Whether Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Jewish or whatever, we parents are grateful for these schools.  A blessed alternative to the over-crowded and ill-run public schools in our area.  Though charter schools are privatizing the public education...what can we do?  The public schools have been known for miss-handling the funds they are given.  The educators are not under assessment as they are in charter schools.  The wealthier get a better education.  The poor are suffering.  The discipline is lacking. And here comes Harmony, a school of true diversity in both its educators and students.  They not only expect the students to achieve but help them to do it.  The character development missing in our public schools is emphasized at Harmony but no religious instruction is taught.  It seems the attention of this article was to cause controversy and what a shame.  The record of success of students was barely touched upon and not given proper due.\r<br/><br/>I, personally, am very grateful to Harmony.  They accepted my disabled son and have helped him in every way possible to succeed.  (Sorry to the people who had a bad experience in NY. They were not in Harmony though.)   This was much better than the public schools or the other charter schools he has attended.  By the way, one of the charter schools has ties to the Swedish community\u2026you better get on that! \r<br/><br/>Many parents have had their children on the waiting lists to enter Harmony for years\u2026.we were among them.   We are so happy they are building more schools to accommodate more children.

I didn't feel that the public school he went to met his needs as well as other students. He was just a number, a pass/fail. We transfered him to Harmony Science Acad in 1st grade. His teacher supported him throughout his difficulties, academically and emotionally. His 2nd &amp; 3rd grade teacher did the same and since then, he has not only improved academically but he has gained so much confidence over the last 3 years.  These teachers go above and beyond for their students and the success of their students is proof in itself.

The public school my children were assigned to had several years prior become a title one school and the quality of the school suffered as a result.  The principal was unreachable and her assistant was rude and uncaring.  My second grader's teacher was very stern and intimidating to the students, leaving many of the children crying each day.  One of my children was ahead of the rest of his class so was told to just bring a book to school and read quietly while the rest of the class caught up.  The school emphasized heavily how to take the TAKS state mandated testing, not the content of the tests.  I felt the entire year was wasted.  My experience in the Harmony system, on the other hand, has been exemplary.  Despite a lower pay grade, their teachers (most of whom are American/white) are very enthusiastic about teaching and take a deep interest in each and every student.  Academics are explemplary but the whole child is closely cared for as well.  Teachers are reachable by e-mail or phone weekdays and weekends and administrators are easily contacted as well.  Our principal, though Turkish, is by far the best of any administrators I have worked with at any of the four schools my children have attended.  There is no hint of religious teaching, in fact, Christmas book exchanges specifically detail not to include any religious books as there is a wide range of faiths represented in the school.  The student body is incredibly diverse and parents are extremely dedicated.  Acceptance is by lottery so the students come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds.  Despite this, the test scores are consistently high.  Though I appreciate watchdogs looking out for appropriate spending of school funding, perhaps the Times' energy would have been better spent dissecting the reasons this school excels in teaching, teacher and administrator quality and student achievement.  With a failing public school system not just in Texas, but nationwide, I am much more concerned about the performance of our schools in preparing our children for a successful life than in how their money is apportioned.  Though the latter is important, it pales in comparison to the primary mission of educating our next generation.  I would challenge the Times to publish a follow-up article that looks at a detailed comparison of successful Charter schools such as Harmony compared to our public school models--or is the Times too much in bed with the teachers' unions to dare to question our public school models?", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 2829968, "replies": [], "lft": 60, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/garden/battling-moths-and-mice-in-your-home-the-pragmatist.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3966326, "rgt": 61, "userDisplayName": "Anita", "createDate": "1307592860", "userID": 30347563, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1307593458", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1307589858", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "Re Comment #16: Relocating animals to unfamiliar areas is NOT humane.

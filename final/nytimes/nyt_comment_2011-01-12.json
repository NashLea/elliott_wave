Except the sun and the moon - those were special (because they glowed? because they were so big?).<br /><br />So EVERYTHING that moved against the fixed stars was a planet (\"wanderer\" from the Greek \"planasthai\"). Well, comets weren't planets, they moved differently and with less (apparent) regularity. Then we discovered asteroids, and those were small (some not so small), but they had regular-ish orbits like planets. Are they planets? Oops, too complicated, let's consider stars...<br /><br />Stars are easy, right? Big bright gassy orbs that give off heat and light. Then we discovered brown dwarfs, stars (or is it \"stars\"?) that don't glow. And then neutron stars, which maybe used to be stars, but they collapsed.<br /><br />We refine categories all the time. When I was in junior high (deep in the past of the second half of the 20th century), there were 8 or 10 or 12 phylums of animals, from protoplasm to sponges to a few kinds of worms to arthropods to chordates. And only two kingdoms - everything alive was either a plant or an animal. Well now there are three kingdoms, or is it five? Are fungi plants or animals - no, now they have their own kingdom. And what used to be a kind of bacterium, the archaea, now have THEIR own major category too. Is anybody complaining and having elementary school kids writing to get archaea reclassified as standard germs? And I looked up in Wikipedia yesterday to find that there are now FORTY phylums of animals! Where did THEY all come from?<br /><br />Look, science reclassifies things as new orders of difference and similarity are identified that help us understand how the universe is composed. We learned enough about Pluto to find out that its differences from the other planets and the similarities of other, previously unknown, things to it argued for a new path to understanding. So a new category, \"dwarf planet\" was created.<br /><br />Happens all the time.

Naming a planet after one's kid is as ridiculous as William Herschel trying to name Uranus after King George III. Second, the IAU got it wrong, precisely because they made a premature decision based on insufficient information, a decision more about politics than about science. It doesn't matter whether Eris or Pluto is bigger; both are planets because they are in hydrostatic equilibrium and orbit the Sun. Dr. Alan Stern coined the term dwarf planet to indicate objects large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium but not large enough to gravitationally dominate their orbits. He never intended for dwarf planets to not be considered planets at all! Dwarf stars are still stars, and dwarf galaxies are still galaxies; so, too, dwarf planets are a third class of planets in addition to terrestrials and jovians. The IAU--actually four percent of the IAU--got it wrong because they operated under the assumption that there are only two kinds of planets when the reality is there are many more types, some probably yet to be discovered.

And they want Taiwan back. All they have to do is create a viable land-based counterforce to our sitting duck fleet, a fleet designed in the 1940s.  With their GDP, they can do this easily without breaking into a sweat.<br /><br />That said, I've been warning about this for years to anyone willing to listen - because I've watched this unfold with my own eyes. I do business in China and Japan.<br /><br />After Nixon opened up China, the first trade was in clothing. Cheap simple clothes, like socks and underwear. Then came the knockoffs - mostly bad quality.  BUT, their knockoffs got better and better - to the point that no one could tell the difference.  The quality garment makers took notice and started using the Chinese to make the good stuff.  Japan and Germany leased them the sophisticated sewing equipment.  Then they started making quality fabric.  Today, they have the worldwide garment industry tied up.  No one could make a big line anywhere else even if they wanted to.  All the technology, skill and materials are over there.  Same with the toy industry.  Garments and toys were not considered a national security issue, so no one cared.  Same with skis, surfboards, tires, appliances, car windshields, on and on.  You name it.<br /><br />The second wave was electronics.  Same story.  At first the cheap stuff.  Now everything is made there - including my iPhone and major electronic parts used by our military.  Along with electronic manufacturing came programming and Internet spying and massive ripoffs of technology. Have you forgotten DVD copies?  The country is one giant theft ring full of economic gangsters.<br /><br />The stupidest thing was that Iridium project in the 90s when Motorola and McDonnell Douglas \"licensed\" their satellite technology to China and taught them how to build rockets to fire the Iridium telecom satellites into orbit.  That gave the Chinese a huge leap forward -- so far forward that they will likely have a man on the moon in two years. After that stupidity came the Boeing and Airbus decision to build plane parts in the very city where this fighter is being made. And you don't think technology is being transferred?<br /><br />Add to this the fact that every American is habitually shipping jobs and wealth to China every time they make a purchase at Walmart or anywhere else for that matter.  Where Walmart led, the competitors were forced to follow.<br /><br />Today, we make almost nothing here nor are we able to.  The skills and technology are now gone.  Plus, they are the bankers.  This hotel I'm staying at here in Tokyo is more than 80% occupied by Chinese - all coming here to Shibuya to shop.  They are awash in cash.<br /><br />And do you know who we have to thank for this?  Big corporations.  They own the place and their corporate agenda comes first - way ahead of our national economic or military security.  They call it Free Trade, but it's really their money laundering machine.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2282043, "replies": [], "lft": 400, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/world/asia/12fighter.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3214480, "rgt": 401, "userDisplayName": "mrlaz", "createDate": "1294780998", "userID": 60770416, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294811606", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "tulsa usa", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294811606", "commentSequence": 190, "commentBody": "the chinese will have a squadron of these operational in less than five years, mark my words", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2282043, "replies": [], "lft": 406, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/world/asia/12fighter.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3214554, "rgt": 407, "userDisplayName": "NW", "createDate": "1294781702", "userID": 60688664, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294811606", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294811606", "commentSequence": 191, "commentBody": "In comments to reporters afterward, Mr. Gates said he directly asked Mr. Hu why the test of the J-20, a radar-evading jet that has the same two angled tailfins that are the trademark of the Pentagon\u2019s own stealth fighter, the F-22 Raptor, was conducted during his trip to Beijing. Mr. Hu replied, Mr. Gates said, that it \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with my visit.\u201d<br /><br />I believe that this is true. China is a country where people are very serious about numbers and dates. For example, Beijing Olympics opening ceremony started at 8:08 pm, Aug 8, 2008. In Chinese, this is 2008.8.8, 8:08 pm or 8.8.8.8.8, a very luck number for the Chinese. The J-20 virgin flight took place and completed at Jan. 11, 2011, 1:11 pm. Do you see something here? 11.1.11.1.11. I guess that it is all about. Therefore, it is coincidental to Mr. Gates' visit to China", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

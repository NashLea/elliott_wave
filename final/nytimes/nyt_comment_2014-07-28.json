Israel's leaders need to stop worrying so much about Hamas and start worrying about world opinion and about their own people's reputation as a righteous community. They also need to stop building settlements in the West Bank and start negotiating a peace deal with Fatah that will end with the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Once that's accomplished Hamas will either go along or end up looking like a bunch of hard-core rejectionists completely devoid of support within or without the Arab world.

In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.  In other words, a law mandating that all employer insurance provide free contraceptive need not be subjected to the usual, stringent, \"strict scrutiny\" test, even if some employers may object to the law on religious grounds. That's the O's legal precedent. <br/><br/>The Smith holding was questioned, in dicta (not essential to a holding, but merely Justices voicing a point of view - in Church of Lukumi Bab Aye, Inc., v. Hialeah, 605 U.S. 220 (1993).  Justice Souter wrote, in a concurrence, that there may be powerful reasons to interpret the Free Exercise Clause as applying to all laws that impact religious exercise, not merely those that seek its prohibition, so that neutrality must be substantive (not inhibit actual religious practice), not merely formal (not directly target religion).  Similarly, Justices Blackmun &amp; O'Connor wrote Smith was wrongly decided, \"because it ignored the value of religious freedom as an affirmative individual liberty and treated the free exercise clause as no more than an anti-discrimination principle.\"<br/><br/>Would not be surprised if the Supremes agreed to hear this.

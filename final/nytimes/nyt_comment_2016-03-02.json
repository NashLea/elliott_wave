This is the party of fiscal hypocrisy, that rails against deficit spending while out of power, then runs up debt levels by slashing tax rates for the wealthy and increasing spending while in power.  Maintaining this hypocritical attitude while campaigning as the party of fiscal responsibility is the single biggest reason that this country's debt level is so high.

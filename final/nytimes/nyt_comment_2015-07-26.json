First, I think it is an excellent idea for those looking to renovate their one bedroom apartment to something more space savvy. I myself wouldn't have thought about this but it is smart and saves a lot of money. In the city of Detroit there are a abundance of One bedroom apartments available but not two. So it would seem that this article would be useful for those looking to live in cities that are all over the country. On the other hand, the article mentions how practical this is for families and I disagree. \"Raising children in the dining room may not seem like the American dream of home-ownership. But in New York City\u2019s tight real estate market, the reconfigured one-bedroom may be a way for buyers to move up, if only a half-step.\" A small cramped space where they can barely move around for what reason other than to live in New York. New York is an enormous city and is already over populated to say the least. People could choose to leave the city and raise their families in a spacious environment.

They could trade RB Bradshaw for a #2 or #3.  Maybe they could then trade a #1 and two #3's to SF for Patrick Willis and a #5.  The net-net: 29 year-old Osi,a #2 and a #3 for 25 year-old Willis.

And in saying this I am no more supporting Kony than O'Donnell (I'm not a witch, I'm you).   American religious apocalypticism (cf.Sharlet's study _The Family_) and the desire to see societal or divine wrath visited upon the living (Fox News), the invocation of divine power to protect society or exorcise the \"demonic\" (Palin) should all be familiar to readers of the Times.  Mormons often believe that their garments protect believers from violent deaths; Catholics often believe this about their medals, and Evangelicals about biblical verses written on paper.

Even the sexual prohibitions should not be surprising to anyone familiar with ideas of sexual abstinence and prowess in sports.<br /><br />The question for me is, how does this article help us understand the conflict or the larger context?

We are glum because articles such as this one describe us as \"pigs in a python\" and, in envisioning our \"final stage,\" appear to be waiting for us to die.<br /><br />In fact, if those born in the second half of the twentieth century -- and not just baby boomers, born in the 1950s -- are swigging their skim milk, eating their granola, and expecting to leader longer, productive lives, that is because advances in health care, better nutrition, life-long exercise and a generally healthier life style, have increased life expectancies for all.  Moreover, despite the reality that many people live long, but are disabled, today's sixty year olds are not delusional to believe that they are healthier than their parents were at their age; they are healthier.  Ask most eighty year-olds, and they will tell you that they did not run daily, eschew tobacco and fatty foods, meditate or engage in other relaxation techniques, or eat low-fat, low-animal protein diets.  My mother could not run almost 4 miles daily at age 60.  I and many others my age can, and do.   Moreover, because we are healthier at 60 than were our parents, my husband and I hope that, barring a medical catastrophe (those genes; the environment), we will be healthy, not disabled, at eighty or eighty-five.  So America had better stop waiting for us baby boomers to die, or trying to convince us that we are crazy to feel healthy.

We refuse to step aside, because we are healthy, and need incomes.  Trying to convince us that we are delusional or selfish because we won't conform to previous, outmoded standards and actuarial tables predicting at what age people will become too old, infirm, or senile to go to work each day, won't solve the problem.<br /><br />There may be more boomers than there are members of other age cohorts, but all of those born after mid-twentieth century, and certainly the kids born today -- my 21 year old son, his future children -- are going to live a long time.

The Boomers had a chance to build upon the Greatest Generation's achievements of balanced growth, and comfort balanced with responsbility.  Instead, they have squandered the opportunity, leaving a mess that younger generations will need to contend with.  The principal US political rift in the coming years won't be left/right, north/south or Republican/Democrat; it will be Boomers vs. later generations.

The conspirators will strike from within.  The first stage is to get a very conservative, 80 year old man with limited experience of actual 21st century life appointed as Pope.  Ideally, this Pope should adhere rigidly to matters of church doctrine that are highly destructive to the Church, such as repeatedly insisting on celibacy for priests, a very secondary role for women in the Church, rejection of homosexuals, the banning of any form of birth control and the concealment of pedophile priests. If this were all, however, the Church might still somehow survive intact, although in a weakened form.<br /><br />The master stroke is to persuade the cardinals to appoint someone who has been in charge for years of the central Vatican office for dealing with matters relating to pedophile priests.  We know that thousands of such cases have been referred to the Vatican, and that the Vatican has been stonewalling such cases for years.  Thus it would only be a matter of time before it was found that the new Pope had been involved in concealing or ignoring many such cases.  Since the cases of pedophilia are still coming to light in their hundreds, and the Catholic faithful are disgusted by these crimes and the lack of action of their bishops and the Vatican (which guided their actions), then the new Pope would be widely discredited, and the Catholic Church terribly damaged.  There are those who might say that the Church is much to wise to expose itself to these dangers.  One can only hope that morality, and not self-interest and arrogance, will guide the actions of the Church to prevent this evil plan from succeeding.

And, more importantly, when can we expect the leaders of the church to stop coddling men who rape children?<br /><br />In this most recent case, from Wisconsin, the offending priest asked that he not be defrocked because he was old and wished to die with dignity.<br /><br />In other words, he asked for mercy because he was at a vulnerable stage in his life, right?<br /><br />Just like the children he molested.<br /><br />I know I'm stating the obvious, but it is extremely creepy that the Pope and his underlings are more concerned with preserving the power and status of the church than with ridding their ranks of rapists.<br /><br />Very creepy indeed.", "recommendationCount": 147}, {"assetID": 1296989, "replies": [], "lft": 136, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/world/europe/27vatican.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1756346, "rgt": 137, "userDisplayName": "David Chowes,", "createDate": "1269575744", "userID": 19856934, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1269576165", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1269597898", "commentSequence": 31, "commentBody": "Par for the course, the Catholic Church and the Pope.

However, the Catholic church seems to seek and nurture a different phenotype who prefer to abuse altar boys over young girls by about a 70% to 30% ratio.  This indicates an absolute institutional selection of these pedophiles.  This would not continue without the enablement or support of very senior leaders of the Catholic church including the Pope.  His recent letter to the Irish indicates he believes the saving of one fallen prelate is somehow more significant the the losses of all of the victims.

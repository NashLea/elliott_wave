That\u2019s all that matters to administrators of schools. A school here in Williamsburg VA has been ruined by its children's low SOL scores, and parents are being encouraged to move their children to other schools due to lack of accreditation of that one. However the kids educated at that school, know about the Bill of Rights' purpose and history.<br/>\nOf course here in the south, it's hard for children to understand how the country believes in the Bill of Rights, since all people here do not have equal rights!<br/>\nWhen this country brings big businesses' travesties; and especially big banks to justice for illegal practices in lending, perhaps I'll believe again in the Bill of Rights. I'm 72 years old, and probably I will not live to see justice correct or give restitution for the fraudulent actions Wells Fargo's used to foreclosure on my own home. That institution just steamrolls over people and the Bill of Rights, destroying any ethical standard in its way!!!<br/>\nAlso judgments by the court are not upheld, simply because \\\"times have changed\\\" I'm speaking of spousal support I thought to have been given to me, which isn't protected by the court. Lawyers want $15,000 up front before they'll take my case, which isn't possible because medical costs took my savings, years ago.<br/>\nLabor laws aren't worth the paper upon which they're written. Once I achieved 55 years of age, higher insurance costs created a liability for my employer, and I was discharged repeatedly from positions for which my qualifications, education, etc. and good interviews allowed my hire. Blue Cross/Anthem found out my age three months after my hire by them, by repeatedly demanding that I complete their forms for health insurance, even though I told them I already had it (Medicare). They insisted that I complete the birth date part of the application, and when I finally acquiesced, I was told to have my picture ID badge changed to include that. Do you think that the Labor Board did anything about that? No!! There was a class action lawsuit against that insurance company for employees' claims of age discrimination at that time, but I wasn't included in it, the lawyers said, because I hadn't worked there long enough!<br/>\nWhy even teach \\\"civics\\\" to children who won't see any of the ideals therein followed, in their lifetimes? That leads to disappointment and frustration! IT IS THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM!!! However I'll keep batting at the \\\"windmills\\\" of \\\"the system\\\" until I can't raise my head to do so any longer....\r", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2699297, "replies": [], "lft": 146, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/us/politics/05barton.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3782295, "rgt": 147, "userDisplayName": "WJH", "createDate": "1304567470", "userID": 13257439, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304568656", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304565056", "commentSequence": 53, "commentBody": "I know that this article does give enough information so that wne can know what a complete charlatan this guy is but I am always deeply disturbed by the inablility of the press to convey just how cheap and unsubstantial the so called research and the even more misnamed ideas that these individuals spout are. These remarks apply equally well to some much praised people who are thought to be powerful intellects like Antonin Scalia. What they are doing just doesn't scrub it. What passes for historical argument among these people is to cherry pick a few quotes that seem to support your favorite prejudice, to apply a bit of sophomoric sophistry to it and to present it as an argument of great moment. The media are just not doing their jobs when they let them get away with this. A serous attempt to reconstruct what someone meant would involve studying and reconstructing the context they arose from and that means figuring out the conditions under which assertions were made. In a time when communication was limited travel was terribly slow and illiteracy commonplace, when lifespans were brief and many things we take for granted were precious simple statements often meant things drastically different from what we might think them to be. For example economic historians might have established that something like a coat or a kettle cost a huge amount of money in that economy. Something might be said to be as precious as a coat and this could be taken to mean it was nothing special when the opposite was true. The so called discoveries of these \"self taught historians\" are for the most part without merit. They just sail past things that need to be painstakingly checked one at a time and stumble over things that are well established. By and l;arge no one really calls them to task.

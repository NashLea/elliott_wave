The 2006 census had estimated that there were 1,411 tigers, without including any from the Sunderbans.<br/><br/>Thirty per cent of the tiger population lives in areas outside the government's reserves, giving conservationists a new challenge in the effort to protect them.<br/><br/>The celebrations, however, were muted by the decrease in land area where tigers can thrive. \u201cTiger occupancy areas shrunk from 9 million hectares to less than 7.5 million hectares over the last four years,\u201d said Environment and Forests Minister Jairam Ramesh. \u201cThis means that tiger corridors are under severe threat, especially in central India\u2026in Madhya Pradesh and northern Andhra Pradesh.\u201d<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, these are the two States that have fared the worst in the census, with tiger populations falling to 213 in Madhya Pradesh and 65 in Andhra Pradesh.<br/><br/>Successful efforts<br/><br/>The largest number of tigers lives in Karnataka \u2013 about 280 \u2013 and conservation efforts have been successful in the entire Western Ghats area, with Tamil Nadu and Kerala also seeing good results.

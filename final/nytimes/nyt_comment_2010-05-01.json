Actions will be taken to increase oversight to prevent future accidents. Government can and must play an appropriate role here. If a company was lax in its prevention practices, it must be held accountable. It is inexcusable for any oil company to not invest in preventative measures. They must be held accountable or the public will forever distrust the industry.<br /><br />This was the position I took as an oil and gas regulator and as Governor of Alaska when my administration ramped up oversight of the oil industry and created a petroleum-systems-integrity office to monitor our oil and gas infrastructure for potential environmental risks. I took a lot of heat for the stand I took \u201cagainst the oil industry\u201d (which is how political adversaries labeled my actions). But we took tough action because there was proof of some improper maintenance of oil infrastructure which I believed was unacceptable. We instituted new oversight and held British Petroleum (BP) financially accountable for poor maintenance practices. We also filed a Friend-of-the-Court brief against Exxon\u2019s interests for its decades-old responsibility to compensate Alaskans affected by the Valdez spill, and I took other actions \u201cagainst\u201d the industry which ultimately helped hold it accountable.<br /><br />All responsible energy development must be accompanied by strict oversight, but even with the strictest oversight in the world, accidents still happen. No human endeavor is ever without risk \u2013 whether it\u2019s sending a man to the moon or extracting the necessary resources to fuel our civilization. I repeat the slogan \u201cdrill here, drill now\u201d not out of naivet\u00e9 or disregard for the tragic consequences of oil spills \u2013 my family and my state and I know firsthand those consequences. How could I still believe in drilling America\u2019s domestic supply of energy after having seen the devastation of the Exxon-Valdez spill? I continue to believe in it because increased domestic oil production will make us a more secure, prosperous, and peaceful nation.<br /><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/notes/sarah-palin/domestic-drilling-why-we-can-still-believe/384560338434\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.facebook.com...</a>", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1417539, "replies": [], "lft": 1356, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/us/01gulf.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1927188, "rgt": 1357, "userDisplayName": "BillTuckerUS", "createDate": "1272683795", "userID": 60014351, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1272686560", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Ho Chi Minh City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1272682960", "commentSequence": 589, "commentBody": "One month ago (March 30) in the NYT under the headline:<br /><br />\"Obama to Open Offshore Areas to Oil Drilling for First Time\"<br /><br />\"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is proposing to open vast expanses of water along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling, much of it for the first time, officials said Tuesday.\"<br /><br />This nonsense from our White House engendered 968 comments from the astute readers of this paper.

If federal officials said it could\u2019ve been contained earlier, why wasn\u2019t every effort used to do so?  Not only has the oil polluted our water, but it has also ruined the habitats of the vast marine life. This escalates further into the food that we eat.  There will be a massive plateau of sales from the Gulf of Mexico regarding food.<br /> The NCAA said that the spill has grown to 5,000 barrels a day.  Imagine what that will do to gas prices now.  BP should be held accountable for their mistake and not the public.  The government needs to have the spill cleaned up without the private company, but still bill them for the cost.  Not only is this spill taking animal lives; it is taking human lives with the explosion that happened two days after the spill.  I don\u2019t understand the carelessness that is going on with the federal government. It\u2019s the same carelessness from the coalmine fiasco.

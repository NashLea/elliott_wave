We still have (a shred of) democracy, so this fear is irrational here.

We need to evaluate the amount and type of violence portrayed in media and video (remember how shocking \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was?) and encourage the media to tone it down.  THere are other compelling ways to make a buck.  We need to seriously look at how we handle mental health, as the Canadian response to the Toronto shooting did, and begin to be circumspect, reasonable, communicative with each other,  identifying people in trouble before they go over the edge.  We'll have to support health care to do this, but wont' the lives saved be worth it?  And we need to support men in our society in being gentler, and proud of their self-control.

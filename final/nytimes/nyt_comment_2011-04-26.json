Taxes on the rich &amp; super-rich have plummeted since 1980. In fact, if you wanted to balance the budget &amp; reduce the scary ole deficit, which obviously neither President Obama nor the Republicans do (according to their own budgets), you would not have to raise taxes AT ALL. You would just have to let the irresponsible Bush tax cuts EXPIRE. In that sense, doing nothing is the best policy. So suggesting that Democrats are proposing to \"raise\" taxes is largely inaccurate. Most are merely proposing to let some of the Bush tax cuts expire. It is true that a few, like those in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, ARE proposing to raise taxes on the rich -- but there's a big payoff: theirs is the only budget proposal that actually reduces the deficit. <br/><br/>We do not live in a \"welfare state\" and it would behoove you to quit using that ridiculous, loaded term. We have fewer &amp; cheesier social support systems than any developed nation. We're an international disgrace. This is not news.<br/><br/>\"There are structural problems in the welfare state ... and in the energy market ... and on and on.\" Funny you don't bother to mention the true structural problem that has turned Washington into a place that makes everyone else in the country \"gloomy,\" as you put it. The real structural problem is that everyone on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue is carrying water for big donors. Corporations don't pay taxes because they have purchased enough members of Congress to assure that they receive huge tax breaks, or loopholes. The Fed gives the banks free money -- for which they turn around and charge you and me high interest -- because banks have paid off the President (who appoints the Board) &amp; the Congress (the Senate advises and consents). Similarly, bankers never go to jail for the havoc they have wreaked on the nation, on individuals and on municipalities because regulators -- again, appointed by the President, often with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate -- consistently give the miscreants slaps on the wrist. The DOJ does less than that. Pharmaceutical companies made out like bandits in a closed-door deal with the President. Health insurance companies won the day the Affordable Health Act passed. And on and on.<br/><br/>The real structural problem is this -- the politicians in Washington are corrupt. They aren't crooks because they've made their misdeeds legal. But they are corrupt. Whether they know the details or not, Americans have figured out that much. That's why they're so pessimistic. They know that no one in Washington is working for them or their children.<br/><br/>And your little theory that the recession is over? Tell that to the 50-year-old who can't get a job now or perhaps ever. Tell that to the underwater homeowner. Tell that to the college kid who has a tremendous college debt to pay off and was lucky to find a minimum-wage job slinging hash or making burgers.

What generation has put more of their own dollars into the educational system than boomers...graduating ourselves in record numbers and our children as well, with no help from the federal government because we made \"too much\" as middle and upper/middle-class wage earners to qualify for any financial considerations.  We didn't even have the benefit of tax-free health care accounts or educational savings accounts to help us with the double-burden of sending our kids to college while caring for aging parents. There are 2 generations that owe us big time...and this is from the mouth of liberal Democrat, so I can't imagine how Republicans feel!", "recommendationCount": 426}, {"assetID": 2666991, "replies": [], "lft": 24, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/opinion/26brooks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3735663, "rgt": 25, "userDisplayName": "lt", "createDate": "1303781155", "userID": 63454249, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303790942", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "minn", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303787342", "commentSequence": 11, "commentBody": "Yes David, you hit some high notes and some low notes, but you did not touch on the real problem our nation faces, and that is how are we going to put a budget together with Tea party congressmen/.women wanting to create a disaster, and the rest of the Republican congress people scared to death that unless they go along, they will not be re elected<br/><br/>So we have a budget problem. We have a budget that the man from Wisconsin has presented. His vision for the future is to balance the budget somewhere in the 2040\u2019s. His vision is to require the middle class and the poor to pay more, and the rich and super rich to pay less. His vision is so radical, that it makes you wonder if he really has blood in the veins, or is he a robot that was sent to us from the Koch brothers. Then we have the Obama plan that is much more liberal to the middle and lower class Americans. He suggests we tax the rich and super rich a wee bit more and cut by small margin middle class programs. Although you can find flaws with President Obama\u2019s budget, it does have a good heart behind it. Then we have several other plans, including the debt commission\u2019s recommendations, and they all have sacrifice for some, and more sacrifice for others. <br/><br/>Behind all the plans that have some heart, we have tax increases for the rich and super rich. The problem being---Grover Norquist has signed pledges from over 200 congressman and 40 senators that they will not raise taxes.  In case you have not heard of the mighty Grover, he is the man that all Republicans fear, because behind Grover is Grovers funding. Of course it is not hard to figure out that Grovers benefactors are the Koch Brothers, and some of America\u2019s largest corporations. They send the word of \u201cGOD\u201d, you raise taxes, and you will have a primary challenge. That is the predicament we face. This congress cannot pass a 2012 budget, totally impossible<br/><br/>So now we have the election of 2012 and being as smart as we are, we say this one is a no brainer. The Republicans want to kill Medicare, and give the rich and super rich an additional 10% in tax cuts, and at the same time telling the seniors of 2022 to go take a hike. Wait a minute. This is the Republican Party that threw this country into a recession/depression, but came back 2 years later and won the house by a huge margin, and narrowed the senate to a precious few. So maybe we should be alarmed. No, not maybe, WE SHOULD BE ALARMED. The Republican machine has over 40% of America thinking that President Obama is a Muslim, that he was born in Kenya, that his health plan will bankrupt the country, even though the CBO scored it to lower the deficit by 1 trillion over 10 years. They have convinced the unwashed and uneducated that because this legislation gives 30 million Americans health coverage, and protects them against pre existing conditions that this is bad legislation and must be repealed immediately. They can make people say \u201cPelosi, Reid\u201d as if they were awful adjectives.<br/><br/>As I write this I shudder. Can they do it again? I am not a betting person, but with the ruling of the Supreme Court that corporations are equal to a person, the way the governors are tearing apart unions and the supreme way Frank Luntz can frame a debate, I would not bet that the Democrats can win. The Republicans will not have a problem raising the necessary funds to again sell the American voter that trickle down will work this time, and they will frame the  Medicare debate to make it sound like they are adding funds to Medicare. Of course they have a major network to pound away 24 hours a day. This network is not ashamed to lie, and will lie because Mr. Murdoch has his agenda<br/><br/>So that is the budget debate, and unless people of sound mind go to the polls in 2012, I fear which direction America is headed for.

Rather than being set aside by the government, this money has been spent by the government and replaced by \"bonds\" which now total 2.5 trillion dollars. However, as it begins to become necessary to dip into these bonds to pay benefits, a hue and cry is raised about how social security is in deficit! So such statements as Mr. Brooks about \"boomer lavish living and hard-heartedness toward the following generations\" play into the claim that such programs as social security are bankrupting the country, even as the government sits on bonds totally 2.5 trillion dollar of money collected from tax payers that include, what you know, baby boomers!

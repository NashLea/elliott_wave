There is a huge difference between sheer memorization of a tremendous amount of data and actually knowing how to use that data. Medical school has long emphasized the former to the utter detriment of the latter, because licensing and specialty board exams are basically tests of rapid recitation with some multiple choice alternatives tossed in for the sake of increased difficulty and confusion. At that rate, the ideal doctor should be a computer. Unfortunately too much sheer data recall seems to cause a fair degree of inability to think things through logically, leading to great prosperity for lawyers specializing in - you guessed it - medical malpractice.<br/>\nIn this computer-driven age more and more exams in many subjects are multiple choice guessing contests graded by computer - and even math exams require one to enter the problem's solution in an exact and strictly timed format, making it possible to get all the right answers and still fail for lack of ability to perform data entry with sufficient dexterity and speed.

But the number of subjects required; the need for standardization; the rounds of verification and calibration; the logistics of finding appropriate subjects are only met by breeding experimental subjects.The alternative is for studies to proceed with affected humans based only on the in vivo data that suggests investigative animal studies. To me, that would truly be unethical. It's what the FDA and IRBs exist to prevent.<br/><br/>There is an argument to be made that some use of animals should be eliminated, such as in dissection and anatomy labs where we know enough about the macrosystems to create detailed computer simulations.  We are a long, long way from simulating whole biologic systems on the micro and nano scales. To do so, we would have to do a lot more animal experimentation.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3301852, "replies": [], "lft": 31, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/krieger-has-torn-ligaments-in-knee-likely-out-for-olympics/", "parentID": 5331725, "commentID": 5332019, "rgt": 32, "userDisplayName": "Paul", "createDate": "1327292685", "userID": 34677113, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1327295723", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bellerose Terrace", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1327295723", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Agree with you. Sad for Ali, hope she recovers well.<br/>\nAs for the back and forth between Brian and KOW: Canada took care of Cuba by a tidy 2-0 score. Running it up against a minnow always invites rash challenges. The higher the score, the higher the risk meter gets dialed up to. Perhaps it wasn't necessary for A-Rod to throw up a five spot in half an hour, especially since it was over at the half.<br/>\nAs a former girl's youth coach, there are lots of tactics to depress scoring to avoid embarrassment. You can insist on ten one touch passes before allowing the players to shoot, as an example. You can scramble positions on the field, so that center halves play in forward positions and forwards defend. 14-0 is quite frankly unseemly, and it doesn't reflect well on Pia. The eventual key matches are going to be measured by the ability of Boxx and Lloyd to control the midfield and to create chances. Yet to be tested, yet to know how this will go.<br/>\nif the ambition is to win another gold medal, a match against a baseball playing minnow is determinative of nothing.

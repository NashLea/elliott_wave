In other words, when the huge fiscal stimulus of war ended, we had factories and labor ready to go to produce not just for Americans craving consumer goods, but Europeans, as well.<br/><br/>How about now? Well, Japan and Europe are not leveled. So, after the music stop and the government pulls back on the fiscal strings, then what? Will we be selling much more to the Europeans and the Japanese? Doubtful. How about the tapped out American consumer, where the baby boom generation is entirely ill-prepared for retirement? I don't think so.

Millions beget  millions more. The  rich demand lower taxes so. others must surrender their safety nets. The people, kept ignorant and fearful shall provide labor as needed at whatever wages are offered. Any benefits only make the masses lazy. The Ryan budget in a nutshell.<br/><br/>However, if the purpose of the economy is to provide decent, secure employment for those who want to work and a strong government to provide funds for the mandate of the Constitution, in a democratic government,  where all citizens are equal before the law, then you do what should be done; make the rich pay their fair share of taxes.

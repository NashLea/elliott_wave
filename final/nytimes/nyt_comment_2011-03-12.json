Bad refereeing calls happen all the time. Yes, the red card to Van Persie was petty, but so was the red card that was NOT given to Alex Song in the first leg and the legitimate Messi goal that WAS disallowed in the first leg. On the whole, there is a need for better refereeing, but arsenal fans should stop hiding behind that. The team is just not that good, as evidenced by defeat to Birmingham, no trophies since 2004 and most likely another defeat from the hands of Manchester United tomorrow in the quarter finals of the FA cup (smiles, jk, no hard feelings).

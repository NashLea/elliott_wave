That \"What is Galileo doing tonight?\" line rang my funny bone then. You may recall we traded barbs about it back then, when I was so ungracious as to point out that Galileo is not doing anything tonight because he's been dead since 1642.<br/><br/>Unlike red wine, that line has not improved with age. <br/><br/>J'Accuse!!!<br/><br/>I accuse you of abusing our host Andy's generous policy of posting everything that comes his way. Out of 43 messages in this thread, some 30 of them are yours. You have flooded Dot Earth with over 900 lines of composition, by my estimate something like 8000 words. <br/><br/>Had you composed all this verbiage yourself, today, it would have been an awe-inspiring feat.  <br/><br/>But you didn't compose all this today, did you, Mr. Salmony?  I cannot rid myself of a suspicion that you dumped a couple dozen old messages you had lurking on your hard drive onto Dot Earth. <br/><br/>J'Accuse!!!<br/><br/>I accuse you of boring your fellow Dot Earth patrons to death with this verbal Niagara. <br/><br/>May I make a suggestion? <br/><br/>Reduce your arguments in the 30 posts, 900 lines and 8000 words above to an \"elevator speech\". <br/><br/>Imagine that you get on an elevator on the ground floor of the United Nations. On this elevator are Barak Obama, Hillary Clinton, the Premier of China and the Prime Minister of India. They are all going to get off on the fifth floor, but they cannot avoid your message before then.<br/><br/>What would you tell them?  <br/><br/>Reduce all your passion, your concern and your belief to something shorter than the Gettysburg Address, something you could speak clearly and convincingly as the elevator rises from the ground floor to the fifth floor in less than, say, two minutes. <br/><br/>I promise you, this will be much more effective than 30 posts of 8000 inedible words.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3049225, "replies": [], "lft": 91, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/a-fresh-look-at-population-bombs-and-bulges/", "parentID": 4290309, "commentID": 4296575, "rgt": 92, "userDisplayName": "Andrew Revkin", "createDate": "1312603365", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1312603365", "userTitle": "Dot Earth blogger", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com", "userLocation": "", "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1312599765", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I agree with Dale.

My father came to the US as a 12 year old from Scotland and started in the WV coal mines. He made it possible for me to go to college and I began a career as a weather officer in the US Air Force. The Air Force sent me to NYU for a year and 3 years later to MIT for two years where I received masters degrees in Meteorology and Aero-Astro.  I know something about infrared heat transfer in the atmosphere.  If the earth's atmosphere were 100% N2 and O2, without greenhouse gases, the earth would be 21C (37F) cooler.  Add more greenhouse gases and we get even more warmer.<br/><br/>I am a retired Air Force colonel weather officer who was educated in meteorology at NYU and MIT and I know quite a bit about greenhouse gases and infrared heat transfer in the atmosphere.  Man-made global warming is real and it is a serious problem.<br/><br/>It is probably already too late to do anything about it.  The good news is that the most destructive species the earth has known, homo sapiens, is on its way to extinction.  Without human intervention, planet earth will find its way to a pleasant equilibrium.

Did an increasing supply of food for human consumption cause the increase of human population numbers because the best available, unchallenged scientific evidence indicates with remarkable clarity and simplicity that human population numbers are a function of food supply; that  the greater the food supply, the greater the numbers of a species?

For too long the US has paid for excessive defence spending that it couldnt afford by borrowing from China, Japan, and Russia,yes Russia, and if that wasnt enough it just printed new money. At the same time US tax rates are only two thirds of the OECD average. The AA rating is too high! China's Dagong agency which is recognised around the world as being more accurate and reliable than the three US ratings agencies, has just lowered the USA to a single A with negative outlook! However Dagong still rates about ten countries including Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand at AAA.

What, if anything, should FIFA do about this issue?  Refs do give cautions (yellow cards) for simulation; which is defined in the supplemental materials to the \"Laws of the Game\" as \"attempting to deceive the referee by feigning injury or pretending to be fouled\".  Refs give yellow cards for faking injury (again, Erika got one) and for players who trip themselves in the penalty area, etc., hoping to get a penalty kick.  I've given cards.  It's a terrible part of the game, it is cheating.  It's lying, and Americans do not like liars.  We're seeing it more and more in youth soccer, sadly.<br/>\nNow, it is true that this happens in all sports. Wide receivers fall over after blown pass plays in American football hoping to get a pass interference call.  Baseball players pretend have been hit by a pitch.  Basketball players cry out and fall down hoping to draw fouls.  Nonetheless, it's a lousy thing for a player to do -- as I said in a previous comment it puts the other players at risk since the ref may hesitate in stopping play and getting treatment for a player who IS hurt.  Currently, it is part of the game, but it should not be.  In professional matches it seems to me that a video of the match could be reviewed by officials that are trained for this.  If a player has obviously simulated an injury, a fine and suspension could be given.  This would perhaps not end the practice, but it would certainly make a player think twice.  Would Erika have fallen down holding her back with no one around her if she knew there was a possibility she would be banned from a World Cup semi-final?<br/>\nFIFA does not like to make rules that cannot be followed throughout all of soccer/football.  Obviously, not everybody has video re-play.  But if FIFA came out strongly against this practice, and did something about it, I think the disdain for simulation would soon filter down to the club and youth levels", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2953378, "replies": [], "lft": 48, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/science/12crowd.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4146420, "rgt": 49, "userDisplayName": "zoolog", "createDate": "1310528291", "userID": 60718855, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1310530502", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1310526902", "commentSequence": 23, "commentBody": "Americans are usually generous with charity, so this idea might work.

Thiney, le Sommer, and especially Thomis all have the pace to burn our wings, and Thomis can outrun anyone.

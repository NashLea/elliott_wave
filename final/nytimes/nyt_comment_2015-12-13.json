The report bragged that of the 660+ students accepted they represented 38 states and 38 countries, dominated by China, The UK, Canada, Singapore and India. However, this claim quickly dissolves when one looks at it objectively, showing one of the problems with encouraging 'diversity' on campuses.<br/><br/>What was most shocking was the claim that \"31 percent [of those accepted] are students of color\"; this number is not shocking, until one looks at the definition of 'color': \"students who self-identify as African American, Latino/a, Native American or Asian\"<br/><br/>While I laud the Universities efforts to increase diversity it is clearly a game they wish to manipulate. It is well known that Whites and Asians (American or foreign) are over-represented on most college campuses (myself being a white male am completely aware of this). If we get rid of the \"Asians\" in Brown's ranking, I would wager that the 31% number would fall to well below 10%. In the US, African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos and Native Americans or others of mixed race make up 30+% of the population. Brown has tried to match that, but by manipulating the numbers.

First, it means that the technical content of certain curriculum be compromised for the sake of diversity training.  Second, it reflects a stereotypical view of nerdy engineering and science males needing remedial interactions with females.<br/><br/>Finally it is demeaning to females.  Perhaps, females and minority students who concentrate in non-technical disciplines should be \"forced\" to take more science and math courses to create a greater mingling of genders and races as well as to better prepare them for a world in which knowledge of technology and science is key.

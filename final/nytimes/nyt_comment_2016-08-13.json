I spent something like ten days in the hospital getting all sorts of tests. I was bleeding and diagnosed with PE, which turned out to be separate problems. But the specialist said 75% of all symptoms are related to the same cause, so they tested me for cancer, everywhere they could think of. Brain scan, CT-Scan, Bone scan and upper and lower GI, in the reverse order that they normally would be. The contraption for the lower GI was medieval in design and operation, twisting me around like a pretzel. The doc who was doing the exam and I weren\u2019t getting along. At one point I saw my appendix (which is still there) was lit up like a floodlight during an air raid and asked her why. She allowed that it was the radioactive residue left over from the upper GI the day before. She then said it was harmless. I replied, \u201cthat\u2019s what they said about Agent Orange.\u201d She didn\u2019t appreciate my retort. We were both glad when it was over. The test showed nothing.

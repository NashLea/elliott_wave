Here is what you say about Benson\u2019s comment.  \u201cIf the signal from the hypothesis is statistically significant this provides confirmation of the hypothesis\u2026 Treating the other factors as noise, the anthropogenic signal shows up clearly by using 30 or more years of data\u2026So, on many grounds, we have a highly confirmed hypothesis regarding the role of CO2. It is part of (but not all of) a quite good understanding of climate.\u201d First of all I don\u2019t know what he means by signal from the hypothesis. What signal, what hypothesis? Hypotheses don\u2019t produce signals. In any case assuming he simply misspoke about climate, the other factors are not noise and one cannot treat them as such. Climate is complex and there is much coupling and feedback; and disputes about positive and negative. The point is that the other factors are not simply noise. There may be other drivers like sunspots, plate motion, and changes in ocean currents. They are coupled. He just wants to ignore them and average them out so the CO2 signal stands out there alone. What a joke!<br /><br />No, I do not trust the scientists involved. Some of them have demonstrated beyond doubt that they are untrustworthy. So you want me to assume that all the others are trustworthy? In any case the economic implications of climate science are so enormous, for example grants, that many nominally honest scientists succumb and are being corrupted. Too bad for the honest scientists; they should speak out; then we would know who they are.<br /><br />\u201cFrom a more intuitive position, what do you make of the Vostok ice core analysis; and what if we superimpose business-as-usual CO2 scenarios onto that graph? Is there potential warming beyond typical interglacial maximums that we should be concerned about?\u201d The Vostok data exhibits many major elements related to Earth\u2019s orbit perturbations. Ignore those; the origin is well known. Look in great detail with a resolution of a hundred of year and you will see a few substantial warming and cooling cycles within every thousand year period, virtually identical to what we have observed during the past 1000 years and clearly deriving from the same basic source; sunspots. However, look at the CO2 data. It is clearly a trailing average of the temperature data but with a time constant of maybe a few hundred years, much smoother, so it clearly is not driving but rather resulting from the sunspot driven warming. It illustrates the coupling that makes the Benson assertion so ridiculous.<br /><br />I have never asserted that the case for AGW is all handwaving. I believe, I emphasize it is my opinion, I am not asserting, that CO2 does play a role, it is one of the players, but it is not dominant. The assertion of a specific numerical relationship between CO2 concentration increase and global average temperature, in my not so humble opinion, is ludicrous. No one knows yet and anyone who claims they know the constant is either stupid or a liar. So in my personal opinion, Hansen has proven himself to be one or the other. In contrast, I have not been making predictions; just asserting my beliefs.<br /><br />\u201cWhat about the potential for shorter-term threshold effects and rapid warming that the poor in particular are not prepared to adapt to?\u201d If that happens, although there is little historical evidence of that, the poor as always will get the short end of the stick. The focus should be to eliminate poverty; we have a better chance of doing that than eliminating CO2 emissions. Both are a matter of broadband will power, and neither is likely to happen.<br /><br />On the issue of science and the purity of the conclusions drawn, you keep ignoring that the work is not being done in a vacuum by pure, dedicated scientists immune to personal benefits from skewing or misrepresenting the data or the science. Again I say there are many good and honest scientists but there are also many lowlights. If I had a way of distinguishing that would be great. Only a handful of low lights are quite apparent. I have no idea about the rest except they are not speaking out and that makes me suspicious. Even in a field as innocuous as lasers, which I knew very well, it was incredible how many lowlights and low beams I ran into.

I am not a climatologist, but I DO work with a lot of statistical models as a software engineer and I can tell you Michael Mann's Hockey Stick machinations are just jaw-droppingly wrong.<br /><br />Scientists who care about our environment need to take back the baton from these political self-serving animals and start calling out the naked politicization of climate science.

There are, however, empirical techniques for mitigating the effects and the death rate for specific types of cancer. Many are not optimistic about the potential fruits of cancer research. It appears it will go on interminably. Similarly, the credibility of climate science has taken some serious blows and public confidence in predictions is diminishing. A BBC poll shows that the number of Brits skeptical of climate science is rising, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8500443.stm\" target=\"_blank\">http://news.bbc.co.uk...</a><br /><br />Global warming is probably a more difficult problem to resolve than cancer and it is almost certain that we will never be able to predict global average surface temperature even if manmade CO2 emissions are eliminated and the concentration returns to the nominal 280 ppm for this current period of the Milankovitch cycle. I assert that because we will never be able to predict sunspot counts, tectonic plate motion, ocean current changes, surface albedo changes, etc. all of which contribute. Nevertheless, the issue at hand is temperature change related to CO2 concentration change and I have been thinking about how to establish the relationship between the related component of global average temperature (GAST) change and CO2 concentration change. If we had that insight and it was credible most or all of the skepticism would disappear and we would be able to get on with resolving the problem if appropriate.<br /><br />One way to do a meaningful experiment is to suddenly decrease the worldwide CO2 concentration by a small amount say 5 - 10 ppm and observe the change in global average surface temperature as a function of time for some period afterward. One can expect a decrease in the GAST in response to the concentration decrease followed by additional changes caused by coupled phenomena. The related changes would be revealed in response to the GAST change, hence a great deal could be learned from a carefully planned and executed experiment. No doubt it would be a very expensive experiment by virtue of all the monitoring and of course reducing the CO2 concentration would be non trivial. Some smart geoengineering people are thinking about how to capture and sequester CO2. It is an experiment that probably could be done and if done credibly would end all the debate and the cynicism.

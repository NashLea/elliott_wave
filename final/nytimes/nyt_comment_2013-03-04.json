Much of what we say, philosophically and otherwise, is the consequence of the arrangement of words.  Through words (language) we generalize, creating laws or principles that we then take for actual entities, e.g., \"Truth,\" or Beauty, or the Good, etc., but also political principles, classifications, etc.  But generalizations don't exist independently of the systems of language that encase them--only things do.  We resort to these language systems or games whenever we think about things we cannot see--for example, the many and various interpretations of historical events or eras.  It is still fashionable in some circles to conceive of the Middle Ages as dark, ignorant, a cultural regression, but some historians are revising that view and interpreting the Middle Ages as vibrant, inventive, and foundational to modernism.  But since no one can go back then and observe directly, the Middle Ages are a figment of language, not a thing or entity.

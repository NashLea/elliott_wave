One primary reason for my party affiliation is that I have always considered democrats to be the party of fairness, sympathy, and reason; a healthy contrast to often hard-line, chest-thumping republicans. I also thought, until today, that democrats would, when tested, stick more closely to the Constitution.<br /><br />This move, by a president I supported, goes beyond misguided. It is pure cowardice. The purpose of Miranda warnings was, and is, to give meaning to the Fifth Amendment's command against self-incriminating statements,  to prevent coercive interrogations, and to safeguard the right to counsel. Its history has been largely a success: criminals are still convicted, and the police can still do their jobs. They just can't keep you from speaking to a lawyer, or lock you in a cell until you break. Miranda rights are not some liberal plot to set criminals free: they stem from the Constitution, and they should not be so lightly cast aside just because a single incompetent loser tried to wreak havoc in Times Square.<br /><br />There is already a public safety exception to the rule, which they used in this case. Shahzad talked, and gave out valuable information. If anything, his case is a perfect reason for retaining Miranda rights.<br /><br />Democrats will not win from this move - they will lose loyalists like me, and gain no respect from independents who will rightfully see this as pandering. Republicans won't gain anything either. And the Constitution will undoubtedly suffer.

The President is the constitutional law professor, not Bush - yet in one fell swoop (this announcement being that swoop), he has given an imprimatur of approval to all the Bush administration did in the name of fighting terrorism.  And to be clear, the Bush administration gave their edicts at a time much closer to 911 - when fear was easier to monger.  Add to this that the event prompting Obama's newly proposed policy is a US citizen alleged to engage in terrorism, and it becomes eye-popping.  Miranda is given by first contact responders - usually police officers or FBI agents - at a time when the investigation is just beginning, before it can be classified as terrorism.  Thus, any person engaged in any criminal act that might cause fear to the general public (the general definition of terrorism) should not receive Miranda warning.<br /><br />Fascinating indeed.<br /><br />Miranda warnings themselves do need to be curtailed, back to their 1966 beginnings, but curtailed for all, not a select few.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1445159, "replies": [], "lft": 132, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/us/politics/10holder.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1964575, "rgt": 133, "userDisplayName": "Bayou Houma", "createDate": "1273461931", "userID": 44614748, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1273464105", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boston", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1273460505", "commentSequence": 54, "commentBody": "Holder is basing his view on the famous New York v. Quarles case and the June 12, 1984 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on the Miranda Exception: 'The U.S. Supreme Court held that an officer's immediate concern with protecting the safety and welfare of the public represented a justified exception to the Miranda rule.\"<br />An imminent danger to public safety trumps the right of the suspect, United States citizens Faisal Shahzad, not to incriminate himself when police confront him on suspicion of committing a crime. Like Quarles, the suspect could have detonated his Times Sq. bomb or if the police arrested him on suspicion before the bomb detonated , the police could have asked him whether a nearby smoking car was his and was it a bomb about to blow passer byes, the police officer and the suspect to smithereens. If the suspect said yes, and the policeman arrested him, evacuated Times Square, called in the bomb squad to defuse the bomb, and later the court ruled that the officer ought not to have informed the suspect that he need not answer the police officer's questions, there would be calls to overrule Miranda in every arrest: \"The most important issue addressed by this case was whether an incriminating statement regarding information about where the respondent hid his gun, could be accepted as testimonial evidence at trial if a police officer failed to provide a Fifth Amendment Miranda rights warning before questioning his suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed judgments of lower courts and explained that an exception to the Miranda rule was justified because the officer believed he needed to ensure public safety. In ruling as acceptable a departure from the required, very precise instructions of the Miranda rule, which ensured a suspect would not be subject to self-incrimination if Miranda warnings were not given, the U.S. Supreme Court gave guidance that in circumstances where public safety was at risk, it may be necessary and correct to forego Miranda warnings.<br />\"On 11 September 1980, shortly after midnight, two police officers, Frank Craft and Sal Scarring, were on patrol when a woman came to their car and told them she had been raped. She provided a description of an black male, six feet tall, armed, and wearing a black jacket. She also told officers he fled into a supermarket. Officer Craft rushed in to apprehend the suspect while his partner called for assistance. He recognized a man who matched the description and gave chase. Craft ordered his suspect to stop and put his hands over his head. Other officers convened and surrounded the suspect in back of the store, but Officer Kraft was the first to reach the man. Handcuffing the suspect, the officer noticed the man's empty shoulder holster and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded his head toward some empty boxes answering, 'The gun is over there.' Officer Craft secured the weapon then returned to inform the suspect, Benjamin Quarles, of his Miranda rights. Quarles decided to waive his Miranda rights and answer the officer's questions without an attorney's presence. He stated that he bought the revolver in Miami, Florida, and it was his.\"<br />So what was the officer to do? Leave the possibility open that the suspect had a gun either hidden on his person or somewhere he could use it against the officer and the public?

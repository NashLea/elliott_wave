I regret that you are yet another conservative who just can't quit the urban myth that Obama is a socialist. Redistribute the wealth?  The only wealth he redistributed was from the taxpayers to the coffers of Wall Street. The only care in health care was the solicitude toward the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical lobby.  The only \"Nanny State\" in operation is the one that protects the oligarchs. And you might have noticed that the only Democrats who lost were of the Blue Dog, Republican-lite variety. Ninety-five percent of the \"progressives\" were returned - you know, the ones who actually fought for the public option.<br /><br />The Tea Party anger is real. My hope is that they bring their anger into the halls of Congress and wreak havoc with the establishment Republican way of doing things instead of collapsing like wet noodles. I am really looking forward to the steamy chemistry between Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell. From what little I have seen of Rand, he will not take being called \"Junior\" lightly. I can hear the sound of stomping feet already.<br /><br />Don't worry about the Democrats, Kevin. They may have lost the skirmish, but the real battle is ahead with the Lady in Red, Ms. Sarah Palin.

The simple fact is that no matter what Democrats do, Republicans will attack them.  So, rather than looking weak by cowering in fear of expected attacks, Democrats should do what is right for their country and party, and then proudly stand behind their actions.  Choosing Speaker Pelosi to remain as Democratic House leader is a first step in rejecting the Republican noise machine and being bold.<br /><br />The reality is that Pelosi did a great job in 2005-2006 helping the Democrats regain the House majority in 2006, then helped expand that majority in 2008, and then had the most successful progressive legislative record in 2009-2010 of any Congress since the Great Society Congress of the mid-1960s.

Unfortunately, like so many of his Republican friends, he is living in Fantasyland. Let's hit his high points.<br /><br />\"The voters left no doubt about their feeling for his super-nanny state where the government controls all aspects of their lives and freedoms.\" First, Americans of all political persuasions do want what Kevin calls a \"super-nanny state.\" They want their Social Security, their Medicare, their unemployment checks, their food stamps, their veterans' benefits, their farm subsidies (think Chuck Grassley here), their tax deductions, and, yes, even those porky earmarks. True enough, the selfish ones -- usually called Republicans -- don't necessarily want other people to have them.<br /><br />As for controlling their lives &amp; taking away their freedoms, that's the Republican platform. It's Republicans who want government to decide how men and women should conduct their intimate relationships; it's Republicans who want to tell men and women whom they can love and whom they can marry; it's Republicans who want to tell women how to manage unwanted pregnancies; it's Republicans who want to tell people who can and mostly who can't organize or join a union; it's Republicans who want to tell litigants how much money they can win in court. Republicans want to get in bed with you &amp; go to work with you. And if somebody does you wrong, you won't even have the freedom to tell it to the judge. Can't get much more controlling than that.<br /><br />\"The president is ... a true believer in a redistribution of wealth controlled by big government.\" Every voter and every politician wants to redistribute the wealth. That's what government does. Now, Republicans want to redistribute the wealth to the wealthy, and they've been disturbingly successful at doing so. (Truth be told, ConservaDems have helped them.) We now have the greatest income disparity between rich &amp; everybody else that we've had since the Gilded Age. Republicans have taken from the middle class &amp; given to the rich. Republicans have passed law upon law aimed at increasing that income gap -- from straightforward laws like tax cuts and union suppression, to more convoluted ones, like encouraging outsourcing, allowing banks to charge usurious rates and treating corporations like people or amorphous gods, depending upon which is most beneficial to corporate interests. I hope you're rich, Kevin, because if you are, your Republican friends are going to make you richer. If you aren't, they're going to redistribute a good chuck of your teeny slice of the pie to somebody who is rich.<br /><br />\"On Nov. 2, voters across every spectrum loudly stated their preference for a return to American exceptionalism, self-reliance, limited government and personal freedoms.\" First, many of the votes were protest votes: voters don't like either party, and in fact, they like &amp; trust Republicans less than they do Democrats. They voted for \"Not Incumbent.\" That's not voting FOR \"American exceptionalism, self-reliance, limited government and personal freedoms.\" That's voting AGAINST the team that didn't improve the economy enough. One reason Democrats didn't improve the economy enough, of course, was that obstructionist Republicans limited what Democrats could do.<br /><br />But more important, millions of eligible voters didn't vote at all. Forty-five million fewer voters turned out to the polls in 2010 than voted in 2008. That turns out to be close to a third of the 2010 electorate who just stayed home. Sitting out the election is, of course, another form of protest. Rick Hertzberg noted earlier this week that \"the members of this year\u2019s truncated electorate were also whiter, markedly older, and more habitually Republican: if the franchise had been limited to them two years ago..., John McCain would be President today.\" Old, white Republicans are not exactly \"every spectrum.\"<br /><br />In short, Kevin, every one of your premises is wrong. But don't feel bad, Kevin. Republicans usually get things wrong. You've got company. Just not as much company as you think you have.<br /><br />The Constant Weader at <a href=\"http://www.RealityChex.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RealityChex.com</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 2705}, {"assetID": 2058348, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/opinion/10dowd.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2817753, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "Frank Mitchell", "createDate": "1289366489", "userID": 15221065, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1289367379", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "South Carolina", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1289367379", "commentSequence": 7, "commentBody": "Ms. Dowd, I thought this was a strange statement for your brother to make about creating jobs:  \"turning the private sector loose to provide them.\"<br /><br />It was the big corporations of the private sector who sent millions of our jobs to China during the past decade.

As you note, two years ago, China was viewed favorably by most of its neighbors, while the U.S. was viewed as a bully.  Now, the tables have turned, and China's neighbors are looking to be friends with us.<br /><br />Conservatives want and need war because it enriches their military contracting friends, and because people are more likely to vote Republican when motivated by fear.  That is why they are saber rattling against Iran.  But, as we saw during the Bush Administration, such an approach simply leads to lost lives, unnecesary spending, and the destruction of the kind of international relationships needed to create a peaceful and successful world.   I am glad that President Obama has turned the page on this approach, and hope that he will continue to ignore the conservative warmongerers.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 178}, {"assetID": 2058393, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/opinion/10wed1.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2817713, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "B.

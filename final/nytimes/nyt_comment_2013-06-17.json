I taught in one of the poorest schools and in one of the wealthiest schools and I was struck by the fact that the kids who succeeded (rich or poor) had a good strong family AND a parent who participated in the school (going to parent-teacher conferences, etc.).   The other factor is the poor families who had many children and little money usually lived in a chaotic home with a great deal of stress and lack of support for the children.  Rich kids, whose parents worked 24/7 and were too busy to attend school functions, do have resources (like tutors and college consultants) to assist their kids.

Yes, of course the wealthiest give their children the best education. Likewise, the poor receive the worst. However, the factor that is linked to each is FATHERHOOD. Families with fathers are wealthier than those without. Those communities that have discounted the importance of fathers- particularly the black communities- suffer economically and educationally, and not even because schools lack money. No school I have ever worked in has ever been without books, computers etc. The difference among them is the discipline of the students and the expectations of their parents.

Common Core is likely to put in relief this issue. It is pretty hard to teach critical thinking in Algebra I if the kids have trouble with their multiplication tables. I had three Algebra I classes last year and the lack of understanding of the fundamentals (e.g. operations with fractions, order of operations and working with proportions) made it impossible to find time to develop critical thinking - I had to go back to the fundamentals.  As stark and politically incorrect as it sounds, drill and kill has its place in education (and not only in mathematics), just as critical thinking does.", "recommendationCount": 72}, {"assetID": 3374161, "replies": [], "lft": 111, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/easy-to-catch/", "parentID": 9251117, "commentID": 9251382, "rgt": 112, "userDisplayName": "Leapfinger", "createDate": "1371441999", "userID": 51284005, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1371442028", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Durham, N.C.", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1371438428", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Easy to see why he pronounced it EYE-GOR.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3374169, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 9251385, "replies": [], "commentID": 9251448, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "Thomas Zaslavsky", "createDate": "1371443128", "userID": 355880, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1371443166", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 16, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Mark Madden", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Binghamton, N.Y.", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1371439566", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "See my reply to \"hummmmmm DC\".

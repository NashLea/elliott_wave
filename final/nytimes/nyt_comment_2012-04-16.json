It was because American dominance in exporting resulted in a transfer of wealth into the US that enabled us to regularly increase wages and investments in technology and infrastructure.  <br/><br/>The idea that any economy can have sustained growth through deficit spending is as possible as the idea that Mr. Krugman could build a perpetual motion machine.  At some point the debt must be reduced, even if only in relative terms to GDP.  And that requires new wealth from outside the nation's economy.

You remove Greece from the Euro. Issue new Euros in exchange from those issued by Euro nations other than Greece. That will leave the Greeks without money to pay their bills, which is the case now and holders of Greek debt will be in trouble; but interest charged implies risk and if you lent money to the Greeks you were a negligent lender if you did not secure your debt.

It was also announced that roughly 27 million will be cut from the budget for next year &amp; a little over 100 teaching positions will be cut. Many of the substitute teachers in our building fight for a few days a week of work. The near future looks bleak considering I am saddled with all this debt &amp; will not have suitable means to start paying it off. I keep hearing that I will have a job when the baby boomers retire--the interest on my 100k plus debt might destroy me before then. I often day dream about winning the lottery &amp; paying off my college debt before I graduate. When I started community college seven years ago I thought I would be looking forward to starting a career after I graduated. What a weird world it has become where a specialized education means nearly nothing.

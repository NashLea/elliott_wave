It is not averaged temperatures arrived at in any way. <br/><br/>The data on the contiguous US support Mr. Heller's contention that heat waves were much worse in the the 1930's and 1950's than in recent years. Yet another reference: Climate Research Vol. 17: 45-53,2001. <br/><br/>Yes, the authors are P.C. Knappenberger, P.J. Michaels and Robert E. Davis. Yes, you have made your opinion of Michaels very clear. But I beg leave to point out that Michaels is actually a professional climate scientist of the exact sort to whom you are always urging us to defer.  His co-author, Robert E. Davis, is another professional scientist to whom I am sure you will pay due deference since he has published extensively on heat wave trends.    <br/><br/>May I offer a quote from Thomas Sowell, \"It is amazing how many people think that they can answer an argument by attributing bad motives to those who disagree with them. Using this kind of reasoning, you can believe or not believe anything about anything, without having to bother to deal with facts or logic.\"<br/><br/>The facts about the horrible 1930's Dust Bowl era heat waves, and those almost as bad in the 1950's (which I can personally remember) are matters of historical record.  To pretend that heat waves in the last decade are anything like as bad is simply counterfactual.

Well, the fact is they are intervening in the form of substantial funding provided by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the Gulf emirates.  Of course, officially Saudi leaders will tell you that is is provided by private individuals, wealthy business men, etc., but given the level of corruption in all these autocracies, it is more than a little difficult to believe that the governments of those absolute monarchies don't know where the money comes from and are simply unable to control its flow.  Moreover, the ideology of ISIS and its cohorts stems precisely from the ultraconservative version of Islam promoted by the Saudi monarchy.  <br/><br/>Question: If the United States sees ISIS as such a national security threat, why does Washington turn a blind eye to the key promoters and funders of these movements?  I suspect that there are many reasons, not least amongst them the need of the National Security State for an external enemy to justify its existence, and the fact that the military-industrial complex reaps enormous profits from the endless wars which are the spawn of their existence.

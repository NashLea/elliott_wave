One of them found out that a family member was missing in the trade center (I believe the relative wound up being one of the nearly 3,000 who died on that day).\r<br/><br/>In addition, I think of The Osbournes reality show because Ozzy likened his dog's negative elimination habits to the actions of a terrorist, which shocked so many of us at the time because it was \"something we shouldn't say.\"  \r<br/><br/>As for the art of 9/11, I continue to be astounded that the best book on the tragedy, The Usual Rules by Joyce Maynard, is never mentioned when considering novels about 9/11.

I think it is quite telling that the overwhelming number of comments have focused on the failed economic polices of the current and post 1966 majorities as opposed to the past diatribes of continuing to blindly blame Bush 2 for everything.<br/><br/>It is true that this administration is headed and staffed with people who have never run a lemonade stand or had a paper route and therefore have no conception of what business is about.  <br/><br/>As a counterpoint, I am of an age when not every family had a car, much less two, and can remember gathering around at a neighbor's house to see a five inch TV.  Cutting to the chase, we have traded an artificial elevation in our 'standard of living' by allowing US corporations to send basic manufacturing jobs overseas to low wage entities.<br/><br/>Why did this happen?  My theory is that the slavish adherence to the Harvard Business School doctrine of making quarterly profits the gold standard of corporate success doomed our domestic companies to failure.<br/><br/>Let me offer an example familiar to everyone.  Mercedes Benz dominated the luxury car market for decades until Toyota decided to create a new marque called Lexus which entered the US market in 1989 and had superior technology and value when the sales price at around $38K was compared to the MB offerings at twice that price.  Did Toyota make any money selling the Lexus 400 then?  Very doubtful, but their lots soon filled up with MB and BMW trade-ins which where faced in front of their initial dealerships.<br/><br/>The lesson?  Think long term and forget the importance of the projections of the Wall Street weenies.

I enjoyed the puzzle, and had to stare at PLANE BOARDS for a long while before I could grasp it.<br /><br />Speaking of BLOGGING, I'm thinking we only have five Jim Horne blog entries left. Separation anxiety looms. Jim started blogging the puzzle (I think) in November 2007. Here is the link to the his original blog:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.xwordblog.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.xwordblog.com</a>/<br /><br />It looks like the first comment was made by Mike Nothnagel. The blog was always fun and creative, and was not subject to the NYT Style Guide. There was a month or so between the end of that blog and the start of Wordplay, and commenters Myles Callum and PondGirl kept things interesting on the old one. After the lull, reading Jim again, at Wordplay, was a grand experience. He seemed to carry on seamlessly, with the same creative spark, in spite of any demands imposed by being part of the NYT institution. And, fortunately, XWord Info was migrated as well.<br /><br />Most readers know how he has kept the interest factor at a high level. Besides seeing an aspect of the puzzle I often miss, he manages to find the positive in every puzzle he blogs. That is astouding. And, without fanfare, he has continued to strengthen the XWord Info tool set. If you compare an Internet product like One Across (google it) to XWord Info's \"Find Clues or Match Patterns\", you'll see how much more robust Jim's toolkit is.<br /><br />His multiple talents have slowly revealed themselves, in spite  of his penchant for humility. Or maybe not, perhaps there are others he has not shared. But, I sense such a creative person has a need to expand. it will be interesting to see what he does next, and I have a hunch it won't be writing Sudoku clues.", "recommendationCount": 19}, {"assetID": 2210543, "replies": [], "lft": 724, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/world/europe/21start.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3061462, "rgt": 725, "userDisplayName": "M Saleem Chaudhry", "createDate": "1292908523", "userID": 54775652, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1292908805", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "karachi pakistan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1292908805", "commentSequence": 287, "commentBody": "After deferring more than a dozen times ,the ratification of the Treaty with Russia,worked out meticulously by Obama Administration,now Republicans like of Kyl,have cheeks to seek unnecessary amendments or another deferring in the name of being last moment push at the end of year for political gains by Obama.After the appeal of a high profile professional, Chairman of joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen to ratify the treaty in the best interest of national security,it's expected that there will be more than required 9 Republicans who will vote what's sensible and reasonable than following whimsical dictate of partisan leadership for personal reasons.This will enable Senate to close this year with creditable achievements, in correspondence with the dictates of the current tumultuous times.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2212365, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/opinion/21brooks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3061199, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Kate Madison", "createDate": "1292901410", "userID": 25120579, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1292908862", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Depoe Bay, Oregon", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1292908862", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "...\u201cErica embodies Judaism\u2019s stand against idol worship.

To me those two observations totally undermine your case for more adult education.  Yes, we do need institutions that challenge adults and connect them to others who are alive now, to those who lived (and presumably learned) in the past, and to those who will inherit the future we leave them.  We do need strong moral principles to guide us and give us the courage to live out our convictions and to make the hard decisions that benefit not just us but also the larger community.  It is quite often religious institutions that offer us those guiding principles, but when they claim superiority rather than a path toward improvement, when they declare that there is something wrong with a perpetually open mind, they create division, hostility, and close-mindedness and give religion a very bad name.<br /><br />There must be a way to ask more of ourselves and honor tradition without claiming superiority and closing our minds. Is being steadfast and proud of our possible ignorance any better than seeming wishy-washy?  Might it not be even more dangerous?<br /><br />If Ms. Brown is exerting so much influence, I do hope you have mischaracterized her.

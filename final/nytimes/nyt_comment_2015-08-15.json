I have other stuff to say, but some blog-followers may not like it. Possibly a good move would be, not reading. We are here for fun.<br/><br/>I look for, and find, things to like in most puzzles. Sometimes, I was the only one who liked a specific puzzle! I am fine with people not liking a puzzle; but I voice my ideas. An example was the \"AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS\" puzzle; many dissed it, but I was awestruck, and I explained my reasons. I could have told the critics, \"don't criticize, it's only a puzzle\"; but I don't think I did so.<br/><br/>More recently, 2 of us stated what we disliked about a puzzle. Many people seemed bothered by my posts. So I say again: some may not like what follows. It is harsh criticism of a word.<br/><br/>The last word to fall for me was GRIDS. S in GRIDS crossed 50 Across (clue: \"Makeup of humanity\"; accepted answer: RACES). I paused and hoped RACES was not the intended answer. I know there is support in books for that answer to that clue, if that's what matters. But I frequently comment on <a href=\"http://nytimes.com\" title=\"nytimes.com\" target=\"_blank\">nytimes.com</a> to oppose people who choose to divide humanity into RACES. WE here, we happy few, are verbal, and some words do not fit: Humanity is made up of one RACE, not \"RACES\".<br/><br/>Disagree if you wish! I'm no THOUGHT POLICE, and I oppose THOUGHT POLICE!

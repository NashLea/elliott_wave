When private prisons place profiteering over human rights, overcrowding is an inevitable result.  The more men each prison can cram into any available space, the more money received in terms of state funding.  The shareholders are happy, the public is happy, deluded in the belief that overcrowded prisons symbolize safety in the streets.  Sadly, many of these men should not be in prison.  Don't get me wrong.  I am way, way far away from being a bleeding heart when it comes to criminals and criminal behavior.  However, California's 'three strikes' law proved to be an abysmal failure years ago.  How many people are in prison now for stealing packages of bologna or six packs of beer?  What about the famous case about ten years ago where a man hit a third strike stealing a golf club from a sporting goods store?  The theft of that club cost him his freedom, for life.  Is that a wise expenditure of taxpayer money?  Do you feel safer, California, in your gated communities, knowing that a golf club thief is no longer on the loose?<br/><br/>The most abject disgrace and a large cause of prison over-crowding is a lack of mental health facilities for the poor and indigent.  Instead of receiving proper medical attention, men with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other disabling mental illnesses are thrown into frightening, subhuman conditions.  As Americans, we once decried a society that would house people in a place called Bedlam.  Lest we forget, Bedlam was at first founded on progressive, altruistic principles.  Today we've a modern Bedlam and it's called the for-profit prison industry.  It keeps everyone happy:  the politicians continue getting re-elected for appearing tough on crime, the populace feels safer because pot smoking, golf club stealing, mentally ill indigents are off the streets and out of sight, the for-profit prisons are rolling in dough and their shareholders greedily count their dividends.<br/><br/>Let's stop the charade that stuffing people into prisons will keep us safer.  We live in one of the most violent societies in the developed world, proof enough that no matter how manner people we lock away, we'll always find more who pose a threat.  It's time to spend money wisely and morally.  It's time to get these sick men the help they need, the medication and the aftercare they need so they can lead productive lives, according to their god given human rights.  Profits of people?

Brooks to lose the phrase \"welfare state\" and think a little about what a complex society should be.  First, societies advance by allowing individuals to specialize and concentrate on what they do best and count on their fellow citizens to do likewise.  I believe that's Economics 1.  Second, in such a rational society (not a welfare state), someone is taking care of the basic needs to allow individuals to specialize. <br/><br/>For the citizens who are damaged one way or another, such a rational society provides for their basic needs, rather than allowing them to die in public or private.<br/><br/>Such a rational society is structured to encourage individuals to develop themselves to the fullest, by providing education in all its aspects, without requiring them first to have (or borrow) enough money before they can take their place as productive citizens of the rational society.  Then, the rational society would consider gainful and productive employment to be an individual's right and the society's need.  <br/><br/>Who is more \"invested\" in a publicly held corporation, the \"investor\" whose holdings in such a corporation is a recommended three percent of their portfolio, or the employee whose peace of mind and body depends on their job?<br/><br/>David, don't ever write \"welfare society\" again; it discredits your every argument.", "recommendationCount": 138}, {"assetID": 2767782, "replies": [], "lft": 68, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/opinion/24brooks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3880141, "rgt": 69, "userDisplayName": "Eli Katz", "createDate": "1306210220", "userID": 13632108, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1306210329", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seattle", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1306206729", "commentSequence": 33, "commentBody": "Parliamentary democracy works incredibly well -- much better than the U.S. separation of powers.  With a few minor tweaks, Mr. Brook's description of British political culture could be applied to Canadian political culture, as well. In both countries, strong parliamentary majorities are able to take decisive steps -- implementing necessary tax cuts or much-needed social programs -- because they don't have to worry about a never-ending election cycle or an obstructionist minority.<br/><br/>Canada, for example, faced a terrible debt problem in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In response, the Conservative government raised taxes and the Liberal government cut the federal budget.  Can anyone in the U.S. imagine Democrats cutting public programs and Republicans boosting taxes?  Never.

The later has received relatively little attention. The fact remains the US in total pays considerably more of its GDP for healthcare than nearly all developed countries (Switzerland is close), and but we get only mediocre benefits in terms of the level of healthcare outcomes. This disparity is a consequence of many, complex public, corporate and individual choices, and perhaps unintended consequences. When we talk about lowering healthcare costs, for instance, we need to consider that reality that most of the costs in the healthcare services sector are the costs of people. Not just healthcare providers, but administrators, billing services, insurance companies, drug company researchers, nursing home operators, etc. So, if we want to reduce healthcare costs, we should consider where else some of these people will find jobs? Healthcare services may be taking the place of manufacturing in our economy; providing skilled and semi-skilled jobs in substantial numbers and a something like middle-class compensation.

The chaos they create by every single inaction has held our economy back with the uncertainties of policy. The total hatred the Republicans in their shattered existence force on all of the US is evil. Reminding them that in the past we were the greatest country in the world because we took care of the less fortunate and unemployed is talking to a brick wall. I don't think we can wait for elections 2012. The lack of jobs and now unemployment for the long term unemployed, including those over 99 weeks who are mostly over the age of 55 -  no minor children no welfare to help,  the growing numbers waiting in line at food banks and soup kitchens, and the lack of medical care is creating a social crisis of epic proportion. I don't think we can wait. Sad day for America, we are entering a winter of discontent at light speed.

I can attest that there are many law students who want to do the kind of law that is needed, whether it\u2019s prosecution, defense, or legal aid\u2014but we do need to put a roof over our heads after graduation. However, the focus on the ABA does not, need to be more lenient accreditation.<br/><br/> Having to hire a \u201cbrain surgeon\u201d when what you need is a \u201cplumber\u201d is an example of the wrongs of the legal system, to paraphrase Professor Morris. But so is having to hire a plumber when what you need is a brain surgeon, especially if your adversary has a team of brain surgeons at the ready. Loosening the ABA regulations could also mean that poorer people in court are left with lawyers with less preparation than their adversaries. In addition, hiring\u2014at legal aid agencies included\u2014is still based on law school prestige. Expansion of ABA certifications might therefore not have the large effect the article hints. <br/><br/>The focus on ABA should instead be on  (1) increasing funding from the government or other sources to legal services corporations\u2014which are sorely in decline, as the Times pointed out back in August; and (2) increasing Loan Repayment Assistance Programs, so that the law students who do take these jobs can do so realistically \u2013 not with frills, but with roofs. Without these changes, law students will continue to look for only for the kind of work that is realistic to repay bills, not just the kind of law that is needed. The cycle will continue.

I can quote the dialogues verbatim, after having watched this DVD several times and the speech that teachers use in their Responsive Classroom schools. I often show the DVD to my graduate students without expressing my opinion and I have consistently gotten negative and confused reviews of, not only the approach, but also of what they are attempting to \"teach\" - \"to help children gain self control.\" One child, honestly frustrated for not having done anything to warrant a trip to a \"refill station\" in the corner of the classroom, with an empty shelf and, what looks like, \"a time-out chair,\" asks the teacher what happens if they didn't do anything wrong. Do they still need to go to the refill station? The teacher answers, \"Yes!\" \"First you go to the refill station, then we talk about it.\" This seems contrary to everything that the author of this article tries to convey. I have also asked children who live in Greenfield, MA, who attend schools using this approach, what \"the refill station\" was all about.

The all believe in the same deity, who is referred to as God. There are many prophets which are common to all three religions. Muslims have additional prophets; including Muhammad. LDS has additional prophets. <br/><br/>In the case of Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus Christ, he was a devout Jew and was referred to many time sin the New Testament as \"Rabbi\"; a teacher. The first followers of Christ were people of the Jewish faith.<br/><br/>The three major monotheistic faiths have a great deal in common. Unfortunately, people focus on the difference, not the commonality. It is for this reason wars have been fought almost continuously in the name of religion fro over 2000 years. And why this blog conversation exhibits these differences. Suffice it to say, your posting meant in jest, actually has some logical basis in fact. Finally, I strongly disagree with the assertion that any mainstream faith is a cult. Dr. Jeffers also referred to Hinduism, Shintosim, Buddism, Taosim and other eastern religions as cults, as well (religions which comprise 1/3 of the population of the planet). His view is similar with Islam (1/6 of the planet). His only true faith is the SBC; 18 million people which is not happy that the LDS now exceeds the SBC number in membership.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3285232, "replies": [], "lft": 134, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/a-theologian-weighs-in-on-the-mormon-church/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4673838, "rgt": 135, "userDisplayName": "MPB somewhere in upstate NY", "createDate": "1318300517", "userID": 63467603, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1318305881", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1318302281", "commentSequence": 60, "commentBody": "All I can say is I agree with #42 \" KEEP CHURCH AND STATE SEPARATE!\" This is what the founding fathers<br/>\nwanted.

Mormonism is a cult, but so is every other religion.  Whether Mormonism is a Christian cult or not is  a matter than cannot be  settled objectively because the concept of Christianity is essentially contested. Those who call themselves \"christian\" cannot agree on what actually counts as a christian. So there is no genuine concept of christianity that we all share and that we can agree on for the purposes of classifying cults.  According to the Catholic cult, all Protestant versions of Christianity are non-Christian cults.  Southern Baptists, of course, regard Catholicism as a dangerous cult. The most generous christians - liberal protestants - tend to count anyone who calls himself a \"christian\" a christian, but might still classify the more weirdly extreme wacko offshoots of their group cultish.  When  a religion gets very big its adherents start to think that its size is somehow evidence of its truth (ignoring the fact that there are other large cults which have doctrines which are totally incompatible with theirs).  So they start to use the term \"cult\" in a pejorative fashion, as code for \"evil\" \"satanic\" \"doomed\" etc. but those of us on the outside of the cult mentality need not use the term in that sense.

Many Muslims take up arms in order to defend against what they perceive to be an attack on their religion and their brothers and sisters in faith around the world. People have to understand that Jihad is part of Islam, and defending ones faith against aggression is considered an obligation upon every Muslim. Have some Muslims gone to extremes and committed crimes in the name of their religion, of course some have, but to believe that the root cause of Islamic \"radicalism\" is the \"freedom and democracy\" found in western societies, or the fact that many women in the west are educated, work and walk around wearing whatever they want, is to perpetuate a completely groundless belief. No sane person wakes up in the morning thinking about how to attack another person, rather they have to be pushed to such a point stage gradually over time. If you kick a an animal enough, it will eventually either A) Die or B) Bite your foot off.<br /><br />Likewise, from a Muslim perspective, the root causes of Islamic \"radicalization\" and \"militancy\" relate to:<br />1) continued Western support of brutal and oppressive regimes in Muslim countries (Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia just to name a few).<br />2) the ongoing wars of aggression in the Muslim world which have lead to the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent Muslims.<br />3) the exploitation and plundering of wealth and resources of Muslims.<br />4) 60+ years of unabated western support for one of the must violent and merciless countries in the world (i.e. Israel).<br />5) oppressive economic sanctions that cut off essential supplies such as food and medicine (western backed UN economic sanctions against Iraq resulted in the death of 1.5 million+ Iraqi civilians following the Gulf War).<br />6) desecration of sacred texts/symbols and repression of religious practice (as can be seen most recently in burning of Qur'aans, the continued printing of the cartoons slandering the Prophet, the banning of the headscarf and veil etc).<br /><br />Most of these grievances felt by Muslims were voiced years before the 9/11 attacks and subsequent launch of the \"War on Terror\" (which has only perpetuated anti-Western sentiment amongst Muslims). The feeling of being under siege stretches back to the colonial period and continues to this day in the minds of many.<br /><br />So the phenomenon of \"radicalization\" we see today is primarily a result of years of oppression at the hands of Western powers. I am not justifying the violent backlash we have seen sprout up over the past decade, but simply stating that is exactly what it is --- blow-back.  In his most recent audio recording Bin Laden pretty much summed it up when he stated, \"America will never dream of living in peace unless we live it in Palestine. It is unfair that you enjoy a safe life while our brothers in Gaza suffer greatly.\" And while most Muslims disagree with al-Qaida's tactics, many share the same grievances that push the minority to carry out such attacks. So until people wake up, study history and realize the primary causes of such behavior, we will continue to see our flawed foreign policy push more and more Muslims, who may have never considered resorting to violence, to pick up weapons and heading off to fight.

We need healthy, educated, and idealistic people who believe in themselves and their futures.  People who are ready to take on the challenges of the global marketplace with the ability to compete with the best of every nation.  We need a workforce that businesses BELIEVE in to enable them to keep jobs here that might have been outsourced in greedier times.<br />The Republicans, the Democrats, the Independents are ALL capable of this.<br />But the most important thing is this:  RESPECT for the Presidency, RESPECT for ourselves and for our dialogue as citizens, and for the true democracy that we have is the beginning of all honest and lasting accomplishment.  Read about the health care bill, read about your state and communities interests;  it really is all posted online.  Encourage independent, critical thinking amongst ourselves and our young people.  And most of all, learn to tolerate differences and to seek common ground.  We may not always agree with each other, but we can take the challenge to do things the right way, the hard way and the long way.  Nothing good and lasting can happen without enduring the hard times and putting in the effort. I hope that we can see the opportunity in our current crisis, and not to be paralyzed with fear and anger.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1092207, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/movies/24scott.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1472058, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "Steve Lovelace", "createDate": "1264478794", "userID": 27470900, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264508411", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Dallas, TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264508411", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "As much as I despise smoking, I hate censorship even more.", "recommendationCount": 21}, {"assetID": 1092207, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/movies/24scott.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1472196, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "Kathleen", "createDate": "1264482466", "userID": 46973871, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264508415", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264508415", "commentSequence": 11, "commentBody": "I wish they would just leave the film makers alone and let them do their thing.

Phasing out big schools? Why?  What did the DOE do to help them? How was it measure?  What type of resources and programs were in place to help our young adults? Is the DOE telling the whole story?  Are they manipulating statistics to make themselves look right?  Yes Parental involvement is a key element in a child's education, stable family lives, and many more things but what happens to those that do not have the key elements to succeed in our education system?  Do we accuse them and their parents for not doing the right thing?  Punish them for joining a gang for what we know is the wrong reason to us?  No! No! No! These large school are the dumping grounds of these children and there are many teachers and administrators working hard with the poor resources they have so they can make a difference.  Look at how they are being rewarded now!  If the DOE was so aware that these many schools were failing their job was to take charge of the situation and work with the teachers and administrators to find a better solution. Smaller schools sounds really good but you must know that the DOE has not had the decency to talk to the parents and teachers face to face in a timely fashion manner about what will become of their children's education.  Yes there are many students that are not doing the right thing in these large school but there are also many who do.  There are many success stories that you do not hear about.  There are so many terrific teachers that do take the challenge and reward of teaching the children so many want to run from and disperse them wherever.  I believe in society, community, and fairness! I'm afraid the media is not getting the whole story to our community members out there.  I trust the NY Times and believe you guys can and do a job with professionalism and integrity.  Dig in deeper for the real truth as to why our Mayor has come out with this new political movement of closing down our schools that are so needed in our communities.  What is he trying to do?  Make himself look good a few years from now so he can run for president? As Mr. Obama just said \"elected officials'job is to help people and solve problems\"  Mr. Bloomberg is not doing a good job right now and he's not hearing the voices of the people! I've been to several hearings at one of the school that's closing and not one person came to the mic to say \"Yes to this proposal of phasing out the school\" Check! I believe they were being recorded.  Do your homework and do not allow  numbers to blind you. I hope I made my point clear.  I am not an English teacher but I am a community member that cares about the community as a whole. This change in the school system is not for the best. Take care and please do not support the closing of our schools, instead demmand more services, resources and become involve to see how you can help!

It is NOT politically correct to blame the Parents, so Politicians like Klein and Bloomberg don't take the Parents to task.  In order to prove that his Small Schools work, Bloomberg/Klein has used the Larger Schools as a Dumping Ground for the most difficult students.  Then Bloomberg/Klein point fingers at the Large Schools and says, \"You don't work.  We need to close you.\"  The Small Schools have received the better students and Bloomberg/Kein say, \"See the Small Schools work better.\"<br /><br />Charter Schools get the better students and if the student becomes difficult, he/she is kicked out and sent to the Large Schools.  Charter Schools is Union Busting and taking money out of the Public Domain and placing it into private hands.  Take your Tax Dollars and give it to a private organization.   Owners of these Charter Schools will get very rich off of your Tax Dollars.<br /><br />In my school we have been told that we need to Pass 75% of the Students so we can stay open.  Bloomberg/Klein have created a Grading System (A, B, C, D, E, F) which Rewards students passing even if they do NOT deserve to Pass.  That is Academic Dishonesty!!!!   Let us shuffle the problem off to the Colleges.  Bloomberg/Klein do NOT care if Johnny Can't Read, as long as they can point to their Accomplishments and say, \"See, more kids are Graduating on Time!!!  We have improved the school system!!\"<br /><br />Regents Exams are another joke.  45% of Social Studies Regents Exams are Essays.  Their are teachers who give students good grades on these Regents Exams without even reading the student's answer.  As long as there are words on the paper, the student's essays &amp; short answer questions get points.  Who cares whether the student actually knew the material???<br /><br />Parent involvement at my school is almost non existent.  I am lucky if I see 20% of the Parents on Open School Night.  The Mantra at my school is, \"Did you call the Parent?\"  Parents need to be much more involved in the Day to Day learning of their children.<br /><br />Another lovely aspect of my school is that we DO NOT GIVE STUDENTS TEXTBOOKS TO TAKE HOME.  How are students going to do Homework if they do not have Textbooks at home?  Too many Textbooks were being lost or stolen so we don't send Textbooks home any more.  In my day, I had a Textbook at home for each class and I did my homework out of the Textbook.<br /><br />I do see value in Small Schools, in that there can be more of a Small Town/Community/Family Like atmosphere in which everybody knows your name.  Anonymity breads Anarchy in the Larger schools like the one that I work at.    It takes at least 5 minutes after the Late Bell to get the students out of the halls at my school.<br /><br />But Anarchy is also created when you place all the difficult students in the same school.  In my day we called them 600 Schools.  Bloomberg/Klein have created roving 600 Schools by placing all the difficult students in the Large high schools.  Then Bloomberg/Klein point fingers at these 600 Schools that they created and say, \"See these Large Schools are not working.  We must close them and put a Charter School in its place.\"<br /><br />In my school, we used to select half of our students by examining their Middle School records.  Now thanks to Bloomberg/Klein we are given ALL of our students and do not select any.  We now have a population of difficult students thanks to Bloomberg/Klein.  In the next couple of years, if not sooner, my school will close and a Charter School will be put in its place so your Tax Dollars can be placed in the pocket of that school's owner.<br /><br />Bloomberg/Klein want to Bust the UFT.  Privatize Education!!!  Don't Blame The Parents.  It is the UFT's Fault says Bloomberg/Klein.  It is the Large Schools fault says Bloomberg/Klein.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my Comments.

If children who are good students don't want to go to their neighborhood school, something is vastly wrong, not on the educational side, but on the socio=economic side.  In order for a school to get better, better students who live in their own neighborhood must attend that school, and their parents and community must support the school.<br /><br />This is not happening.

It has to do with union busting, plain and simple.  When the larger schools close, depending upon the \"transformation,\" plan, most, if not all, of the senior teachers become ATRS, which means they become substitutes in other schools. The Bloomberg/Klein administration has been trying desperately to find a way to save money in public education, the federal government and the state have handed them a \"legitimate\" means to do so by eliminating the salaries of the senior staffs.  These larger schools \"transformed\" to smaller schools will then be staffed by younger, less experienced teachers with little to no resources or the benefit of counsel with experienced teachers. The attrition rate of young teachers in NYC is outrageously high, nearly 40% leave within their first three years of teaching.  Without the stability of its teaching staff, newer, smaller schools do not stand a chance.  Additionally, there is nothing being discussed in the way of the  increased cost of maintaining three or four administrative staffs, principals, APs and such, in these smaller schools, which is exorbitant.  In all of my years as a New York City public school teacher I can say that the big change that the city has yet to make is that of making class sizes smaller.  Even in smaller schools, the class sizes are still 34 kids in a class.  So what is the benefit of a \"small\" school? Managing a large school is an enormously complex job.  Perhaps retraining principals and administrators as effective managers, focusing on the needs of special populations, educating parents, reaching out to parents as school volunteers,  partnering with community organizations to provide much needed social services within the schools, hiring more qualified personnel for school safety, spending money books and technology and not on hiring foreign consultants, modernizing the physical buildings, creating curricula that is meaningful, creative and student centered and respecting your teaching staff are just some of the ways that education could be improved in New York City.

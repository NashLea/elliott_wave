Yet these are young physicians, and like me, they have no training whatsoever in the health outcomes methodology necessary to make such decisions. In the wake of ACA, health systems across the country are putting pressure on individual physicians to perform \"cost effective\" medicine, which is a thinly veiled attempt to get them to provide less care and do less tests - without any system-wide analysis of the sort reasonably described here. Individual physicians must focus on only one thing - providing the best care possible to their patients, operating within a system (preferably single payer) in which society, in collaboration with the best science, determines the tests and procedures that are available.

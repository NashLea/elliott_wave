He also wrote how PAR was a better system-a system that didn't rely on test scores yet helped teachers improve or leave the system.  The editors ignored that piece and praised the use of test scores for teacher evals. He also wrote how Tennessee's evaluations were seriously flawed, yet the editors wrote a commentary claiming Tennessee should not halt the evaluation system despite its flaws.  (Soon after, Winerip was removed from reporting on Education.)  <br/><br/>Yesterday the Times had an article about a special program that helps disadvantage students get better grades through both tutoring and counseling.   Yet, this paper ignores the many factors that go into a test score.   Under Bloomberg, good schools received B report cards. VAM was unable to measure improvement because these schools were already successful.<br/>The editors are so intent on continuing a path that not only hinders students, but public education as well.<br/>Thankfully deBlasio has seen how schools that were improving and had the support of the community were closed under the Bloomberg regime due to an unfair reporting system.  <br/><br/>It's time to stop teaching to the test and instead start teaching to the child.

Therefore you have a mall full of potential victims.<br/>What I most find dis-heartening is how this is handled.<br/>In the 70's, decent cops (maybe like in that show Adam-12) would have shown up, shot the guy if necessary and rope off a small section of the mall.  In hours it literally would have been mopped up.<br/>Today, you have the Imperial Stormtroopers show up, shut down everything, put on a gun show for each other and treat the taxpayers like fools who deserve to be dis-armed. \"Law Enforcement\" acted as if it were the 2nd coming on 9/11....<br/><br/>I did not follow EVERYTHING regarding this story, but they said that they had to keep the mall closed for several days.  Anchors (big stores in the corners with their own doors) even have to be closed, I presume, and this hurts the likes of JCP and Sears, both already in bad shape economically- so some CSI's can earn overtime....", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3392774, "replies": [], "lft": 201, "assetURL": "http://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/the-gun-report-january-24-2014/", "parentID": 11016636, "commentID": 11029721, "rgt": 202, "userDisplayName": "BeadyEye", "createDate": "1390795869", "userID": 12490792, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1390801237", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "America", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1390801237", "commentSequence": 11029721, "commentBody": "CR, follow the numbers.<br/>Gun sales march in step with perceived threats to gun ownership.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3392893, "replies": [], "lft": 5, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/opinion/getting-an-accurate-fix-on-schools.html", "parentID": 11029914, "commentID": 11029989, "rgt": 6, "userDisplayName": "Rima Regas", "createDate": "1390801207", "userID": 52131820, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1390801266", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Mission Viejo, CA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1390801266", "commentSequence": 11029989, "commentBody": "\"It's time to stop teaching to the test and instead start teaching to the child.\"<br/><br/>Amen, Sister!", "recommendationCount": 16}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

I don't know if they even have hearts. Maybe they're Tin Men, maybe they're just Cowardly Lions.

Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said that his main objective is to bring down the President. He's left the President with a couple of pretty good sound bites. The President must take advantage of Republican \"candor\" and post-midterm hubris.<br /><br />But President Obama suggested after his Cabinet meeting last week &amp; again, aired on \"60 Minutes\" last night, that he wasn't going to do that. He said Republicans (and he) behaved badly during the campaign, but he hoped they would behave better now. Yeah, I'm expecting Mitch McConnell to go all cuddly and cooperative any minute now.<br /><br />When people complain that President Obama doesn't have passion, those Charlie Brown moments are what they're talking about. Nobody wants a President who rants and raves and totally loses it. That's why McCain lost the election. But we want a President who has the passion to fight for us. When the opposition repeatedly promises to do the bidding of the rich and do nothing for the rest of us, somebody besides Bernie Sanders and Michael Moore has to stand up for us.<br /><br />We have known for some time that Ben Bernanke wasn't going to do it. We know Harry Reid can't do it. So that somebody has to be the President. That's what we hired him to do. He must shed his Charlie Brown optimism, and be as bold as the adversaries of the people. The President has to devise catchy slogans for every one of their proposals and repeat the slogans so often even the dense will understand. He has to go on Fox \"News\" and repeat them so even the Foxbots will hear them. He has to repeat them on camera and right in the faces of Mitch McConnell &amp; Eric Cantor. The President's fiscal policies may be complex, but he must reduce them to populist slogans. And he must do so now.<br /><br />I know Ben Bernanke is a Republican, so I'm not surprised he won't do anything serious to jolt the economy. Many of us suspect President Obama is a Republican, too.

Economics is a dismal science not because its principles are muddled or unworkable; instead its sound body of developed knowledge and applications is clouded by those who alter and deliberately mis-read facts and exchange them for a currency of apprehension and distress, while sending links and posts to each other to congratulate themselves on the success of their efforts. But their success continues to be the country's downfall. Jobs will not come except from demand; and evil can not beget good.<br />--Walter Rhett<br /><a href=\"http://twitter.com/walterrhett\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/walterrhett</a>", "recommendationCount": 149}, {"assetID": 2050453, "replies": [], "lft": 36, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/opinion/08krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2807738, "rgt": 37, "userDisplayName": "azlib", "createDate": "1289191667", "userID": 41267516, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1289193116", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "AZ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1289193116", "commentSequence": 16, "commentBody": "The inflationistas are clueless, naive or just plain slefish.

The rich will continue to get more funds, donate a portion of them to the republicans and the republicans will do their duty in earning the money by obstructing the recovery. They remind me of the firefighter who goes around at night starting fires just so he can get overtime pay. Just like they just finished doing, they will blame the failure to recover on the President and Democrats, convince the less informed to vote against their own self interest and this debacle of an economy will continue to swirl around the bottom of the drain until the American people get used to Wal-mart wages and subsidizing their income with food stamps!

And, raising the prices a little on imported gooods would help domestic industries compete slightly better.  But on the other hand, our oil imports will most likely cost more, and this would put a damper on our economy, probably offsetting any economic benefits derived from a weaker dollar.<br /><br />The real problem is that we have deindustrialized our country to such an extent that essentially all monetary policies are going to be ineffective in the long run as a means of causing a sustained long-term boost to our economy.<br /><br />This is why the Bush tax cuts could not keep us out of a recession, why the first stimulus did not keep our unemployment numbers from rising to the ten percent range, and why the other actions such as allowing banks to borrow money for interest rates of nearly zero percent have not caused an economic recovery.  And the \"quantative easing\" that you speak of will also fail.  We are not in a typical cyclic recession.  We are in a structual recession which can not be treated with monetary action as those cyclic recessions of the past.<br /><br />Our structual recession was caused by moving tens of thousands of factories to China and elsewhere.  Taking our industrial heartland and turning it into the \"rust belt\" has economic consequences.  And our structual recession can not be cured by tweaking our monetary policy, as we have seen.  The only solution is to stop the destruction of our economy caused by the deindustrialization of America.<br /><br />Our country is a rich country, and we are living off our past wealth creation.  But our wealth and prosperity are rapidly being transferred to China, and it will be gone one day.

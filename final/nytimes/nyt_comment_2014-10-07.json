In 2011 they were competitive until Week 16, against the Giants, and then the wheels started falling off over the next few seasons.

Every NFL team, theoretically, has a chance to succeed if they have a franchise QB, draft well and make the proper free agent acquisitions. Recent Super Bowl winners Green Bay, Seattle and New Orleans are not big market cities by anyone's definition.  You are unwittingly right in one sense, though for the wrong reason.

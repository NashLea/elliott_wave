We must have the ultimate power in a democracy or otherwise it is a cruel, sad joke wherein lies become myths and myths are celebrated as definitive truth.<br/><br/>Follow me here, please. We began with an almost fearful, truncated democracy whereby only the House of Representatives was to be elected directly. The Senate, originally, by state legislatures. The presidency with the intervening authority of the Electoral College and the actual ability to overrule the voters. Even now, because of the states' winner takes-all-rules, it is possible to be elected president without a majority of the vote (G.W. Bush, 2000).<br/><br/>So, step by careful step, we have moved closer over 240+ yrs. toward an actual democracy, yet a president can still ram or sweet talk us into a war like Iraq that results in thousands of deaths, trillions spent and little but blood and desert sand in thousands of boots as comfort. Never again.<br/><br/>Yes, we are an ignorant, prejudiced mass of humanity but, in the end, we are smarter than those sent to represent us because we vote for ourselves, our families and our nation without the corruption of payments of any sort.

Your depiction of Greece sadly is very accurate. The problem with Greece was not that it was a welfare state but that it was a thoroughly corrupt state. The government was always notoriously underfunded because citizens of all classes either underpaid or did not pay taxes at all. This was particularly egregious with the rich.They had no system for reliable tax collection and for this reason alone Greece should never have been allowed into the EEU.Your depiction of bribery is accurate.<br/><br/>In the 90's when Greece was being considered for the EEU,their treatment of the severely mentally was abominable. The EEU gave them money to improve this situation as a stipulation of admittance and to conform to standards of larger Europe. After a time period, no changes were made, and nobody in the Greek government was able to explain what happen to the money. At least in this instance, Greece was made to pay back the money. I know this because I was living with friends of mine in Athens at the time..<br/><br/>Let us not forget the role of Goldman Sachs in Greece's financial problems. They loaned Greece billions disguised as I think \"currency swaps\", not loans, so as to make Greece look more solvent to the EEU. Of course, Greece was unable to pay the enormous interest, a major reason in their collapse. As with the bankers in the USA, they are escaping legal culpability as well as being bailed out. <br/><br/>I think entire severe austerity model has more to do with rescuing the banks than Greece itself.

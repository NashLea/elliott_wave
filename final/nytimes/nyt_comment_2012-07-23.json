Even as extreme heat and drought devastate the midwest, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch will not mention the words global warming.<br/><br/>Thank you also, Expat, for bringing up the point that while global warming is melting icecaps and glaciers internationally, the effects people are most likely to be experiencing first-hand is \"weather instability.\"  No one can deny that we've been seeing an increase in wildly erratic weather extremes.  <br/><br/>You are also right to point out that these extreme fluctuations are the most dangerous, for they are impossible to adapt to.  Not only is this is an agricultural nightmare, the effects on the natural world could be even more devastating.<br/><br/>Ecosystems adapt to naturally-occurring climate change over expanses of thousands of years, but cannot adapt to extremes without consistent patterns.  What happens to the oak-hickory forest that covers much of our nation, and those life forms dependent on it, when one year might bring fierce wind storms, monsoon-like rains and floods, and the next year extreme heat and drought?  Weakened by extremes, the forests we take for granted could be devastated.  Even the local park, and the beloved old tree in one's front yard.<br/><br/>Bring the argument home to people.  Melting ice caps and glaciers may be the most consistent scientific indicators, but it is the wildly fluctuating local weather and its risks that people would be most likely to relate to.

There are reasons why the weather is becoming more \"unpredictable\" in the sense that it is not following historical patterns. <br/><br/>What is the one most distinctive climate change in the past 10 years?  The melting ice cap over the Arctic Ocean, which has thinned more each summer.<br/><br/>The focus of journalists has been on the rising ocean levels from melting ice, the polar bears, and a possible shift in the Gulf Stream. They may have missed the most important impact: changes in the jet stream We see the enormous effect of the jet stream each winter, when a shift in latitude can move snow and biting cold to the Carolinas, the Midwest, or the Northeast. <br/><br/>But what if the jet stream loses steam, slows down, meanders erratically year-round? Then you will have changes in seasonal patterns, early warming followed by bud-killing frost, downpours alternating with drought, and in some places, yes, unseasonably cold winters and summers. According to Jennifer Francis of Rutgers, the jet stream is already slowing. <br/><br/>So, not only does global warming promise more severe weather, the jet stream changes could bring more erratic weather. Erratic, unpredictable weather could be the most dangerous, because it would be almost impossible to adapt to, in terms of agriculture.

NASA followed this same thinking for a time when they decided to send teachers into space and, at one point, asked network television news anchors if they wanted to take a ride (they all signed up for possible flights, except Peter Jennings, who was then anchor for ABC News). (Two U.S. senators went up on the SpaceShuttle.)<br/><br/>NASA was looking for people who could go up and bring the wonder and excitement of space travel back down to earth. The test pilots were wonderful people, but they mainly had the engineering mentality, which was to put their complete concentration on the equipment, how to manage and run it. There are very few engineer/poets. It seems like a contradiction in terms, in fact.<br/><br/>Civilians going up to near space might seem like a silly stunt, as it does to many of the people commenting here, apparently, but it is part of the process of taking space travel out of the realm of scientists and engineers and making it more of a normal event.

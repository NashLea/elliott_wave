Two thing are missing from why Seattle has been successful.<br /><br />(1) Many of the extremely talented people who live here now are refugees from the more socially conservative parts of the country. People who are, let's just say it, liberal want to live around people who are also liberal. And socially liberal people, I'll argue, tend to be more likely to be more comfortable working in start ups. It's also no accident that Seattle's liberal population has spawned very successful bands and artists.<br /><br />(2) More than anything else, I think Seattle's success is product of the fact that failure is permissible because experimentation is expected. Bill Gates Sr. encouraged his son to start a software company. Howard Schultz felt comfortable taking a chance and buying the Starbuck Coffee Company from the guys who had the little shop in Pike Place. The ability to take a chance, and the implicit permission to fail is, IMHO, the key to why Seattle businesses and artists have been successful.<br /><br />(Full disclosure, I moved to Seattle from the South in 90s to go to grad school. Since I graduated I've worked in cellular, enterprise software, and Internet advertising. I've also travelled the world on business. I spend about a week a month in NYC. Can't tell you how many of my colleagues in Seattle are people like me who fled the more socially and/or intellectually repressive parts of the country.)", "recommendationCount": 20}, {"assetID": 2491319, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/fantasy-focus-an-a-l-auction-reviewed/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3500058, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Gerry", "createDate": "1299646055", "userID": 40548408, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299646838", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NW corner", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299646838", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Chisenhall went for $2, Nix for $4 but the probable starting 3B for Cle, Jason Donald, wasn't taken.

The Port is responsible for nearly a quarter million living-wage jobs in the city, and as Asian economies grow, so do we. Washington is the most trade-dependent state in the US almost exclusively for this reason.<br /><br />The UW is probably the world's best kept secret among top public universities - it's affordable (less than $8,000 a year in-state tuition), full of top-ranked departments, with 60,000 students packed into a relatively small city neighborhood a 10-minute bus ride away from one of the best and most vibrant downtown areas of the West Coast.<br /><br />With other factors, the article is a bit off. Luck has definitely been just as much a factor in Seattle's success as entrepreneurship and the \"creative class.\" Microsoft took root in the Eastside suburbs not because a highly educated workforce was ready and available, or because the various infrastructure was secure and well-established. It did so because two of its founding partners, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, had the serendipity of being upper-crust white nerds at an elite prep school working on computers at the precise economic moment (de-industrialization and restructuring in the late 1970s) when doing so could make any decent programmer a millionaire. Starbucks, likewise, emerged at the tail end of the largest crime wave in American history during the late 90's, before- which building sidewalk cafe culture and walkable downtowns (as the early espresso carts before Starbucks did) would have been unthinkable.<br /><br />Second, the author is quite mistaken if he believes that Seattle's affinity for density is at all responsible for its growth. 75% of Seattle is zoned as single-family neighborhoods. Areas of true high-density living, like one would find in New York, Chicago or San Francisco? There are exactly four of them: Downtown, Capitol Hill, the U District and Belltown, with a combined population of perhaps 100,000 people. Seattle only rezoned areas of South Lake Union and the Denny Triangle for high densities in the past 5-10 years. Before that, these and several other areas were nearly barren and full of parking lots. Transportation is a severe problem in Seattle, and it is precisely because the city has not adequately invested in truly high-density, sustainable neighborhoods (especially in its middle-class \"urban village\" areas), that this is the case. Seattle has been drunk on its self-admiration since the grunge era.<br /><br />What is really so special about Seattle?<br /><br />1. Seattle really is the most educated city in the country, topping even Boston and SF. Do you have a Bachelor's degree? So do 55% of Seattleites over 25. A Master's degree? 1 in 4. 1 in 10 Seattleites has a PhD. If are you are a high-school grad, GOOD LUCK trying to live here.<br /><br />2. Compared to local incomes, Seattle has some of the most overpriced real estate in the country. The quality of life here makes up a lot of that. Geographically, Seattle is hourglass-shaped with water on all sides. Pretty much anywhere with a \"view\" - and this is a large chunk of the city - is out of reach to the middle class.<br /><br />3. If there was one cultural vibe you get from living in Seattle, it is the feeling of being unique and/or apart from the rest of the US. As one of my transplant friends often tells me, this is a \"city of the mind.\" It's like Scandinavia on the Pacific. If you want to study with some of the smartest people on the planet, write code that will change the world, fight global warming, or do business with China, this is the place to do it. Socially, this feeling of constantly being on \"the edge\" of the next big thing has some negative consequences. The \"Seattle Freeze,\" an ever-present lack of social energy and perceived coldness to outsiders, is something every transplant experiences. Part of it is indeed due to the gloomy weather. As I'm writing, I'm thinking back to the last time I saw sunshine, and the number of weeks it's been is daunting. Another is the dominant upscale, corporate culture of the city that dampens the nightlife on weekdays in most areas. Finally, the high-tech emphasis of our economy (geeks working long hours) and the influence of Asian and Nordic local cultures blends together to create a relative shyness, indifference even, to new people you don't find in other cities.

One thing that others have commented on or alluded to that I think is extremely important but not mentioned the article is the culture here.  Perhaps due to its climate, the UW or the disportionate number of bookshops and coffeshops here, people here have a strong tendency toward inward pursuits like reading, programming, or just plain thinking. Regardless of source, the culture of Seattle is one that can be overly sensitive, pretty introverted, a little shy while also being strong willed, opinionated and a bit cynical. These traits combine to create a talent pool that is seeking the kind of natural beauty present in the Northwest but also is highly capable in the kinds of skills needed by 21st century tech companies.<br /><br />In particular, a trait that I think many in the tech industry are aware exists among NW companies but is perhaps is less well known outside the poster child of circa-1998 Microsoft is that of competiveness.  Not to put too fine a point on it--Amazon, Microsoft, Costo--these are companies that compete to win and that trait is well engrained not just at the corporate level but among the rank and file.<br /><br />The quintessential Seattlite is someone that you first meet and are struck by how laid back and easy going they seem.

Unfortunately the author didn't bother to do much research and report the actual facts as to why the diet works.<br /><br />I\"m not a doctor and can't give you the scientific reasons but I can tell you from my experience, this diet works. Before giving you the facts, you should know that I did this diet seven months ago and lost 17 pounds in 6 weeks (and I've kept it off but that's another secret ingredient to the diet. See item #5 below). I'm now on day #8 of a second cycle and have lost 4.8 pounds.  Now, for some facts:<br /><br />1. The hcg can only be acquired through a physician, including naturopathic doctors. Before determining if I was a viable candidate for the diet (or not), my doctor did a thorough exam, including having me fill out a comprehensive questionnaire. Next my doctor took a BMI (body mass index) measurement through a machine (this gives the most accurate reading), then took actual body measurements.<br /><br />2. My doctor works directly with a licensed dietician and together they oversee the patient's weight loss program. This is the key to a successful program (most doctors prescribing the hcg diet do it alone, without a dietician or nutritionist). I email my daily 'status' to the doctor and dietician; they may minor modifications if needed.<br /><br />3. I won't tell you that I'm never hungry. I am and personally, I have a very set meal schedule in which I adhere. I know everyone says \"well of course you lose weight if you're only eating 500 calories\". True, but you'd probably be dead soon because no one can survive on just 500 calories for a prolonged period of time. The diet is structured in such a way that you combine a lean protein with a vegetable for two meals a day plus two servings of fruit (and think good food...my nutritionist has armed me delicious, easy to prepare recipes...as an example, baked halibut with fennel topped with grapefruit salsa). The foods are pre-determined so you pick one from each list for each meal. Additionally, because our bodies have physically gotten larger since this diet originated in the 50/60's, my doctor and nutritionist have me on two small protein shakes a day. Plus, three liters of water to keep everything flushed.<br /><br />4. Although the caloric intake is minimal, your body is actually burning the brown fat (bad fat) and using it as energy which is why one is able to sustain for the 23-day injection cycle or the 40-day injection cycle. Your body literally gets the energy it needs to sustain itself.<br /><br />5. Now for the part the author completely forgot to include: in order to maintain the weight loss, the second half of the program is a 3-week period of  \"no sugar no starch\" diet which resets your metabolism.<br /><br />6. Once the injections are done, another BMI is run, including body measurements and then tabulated. The final calculation gives you the total number of calories your body needs to have every day to sustain its current weight. (When I lost 17 pounds my sustaining caloric intake was 1780 calories/day).<br /><br />7. Cycles can not be completed consecutively. A minimum of 6 weeks between cycles is required.<br /><br />So before you completely blow this off and think it's just another fad, think again. Get the facts, do your research, talk to people that have done it and interview naturopathic doctors. If you decide to try it, make sure your doctor partners with a nutritionist - it's imperative to a successful program. Additionally, you must be committed. It's a very, very strict plan and you can not deviate.<br /><br />And now, this \"used-to-be-168-pound-women-who's-soon-to-hit-her-goal-weight-of-135\" is signing off. Feel free to email with questions or I am happy to put you in touch with my doctor for more details about the program.<br /><br /><a href=\"mailto:jodijager@yahoo.com\">jodijager@yahoo.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 2489961, "replies": [], "lft": 462, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/world/americas/08guantanamo.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3499599, "rgt": 463, "userDisplayName": "me", "createDate": "1299635595", "userID": 30052523, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299655443", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299655443", "commentSequence": 177, "commentBody": "Our President is lacking in character, loyalty, honesty and dignity.<br /><br />He is simply out for himself and will sell out on any issue as long as its in his personal interest.

Another off-the-cuff reaction that gets a cheer. Yet, the whole point of the article is to go beyond that knee-jerk feeling and see deeper into what a veteran **player** presence brings. I don't like Arod. But since his 2015 return, someone put some sense into him, and finally he's doing everything exactly right. You can't ask more of a man, of a professional, than that. The article also notes how it makes little sense to release him this year. The team is out of contention and rosters will expand soon. They can release him next spring. The Yanks aren't trying to help him get to 700. It looks like they might even be happy if he doesn't."}]}, "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/sports/baseball/alex-rodriguez-new-york-yankees-final-role.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 19366241, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "stu freeman", "createDate": "1470197535", "userID": 35591703, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1470197587", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "brooklyn", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1470193987", "commentSequence": 19366241, "commentBody": "Heck of a lot of money to be spending on a \"teacher,\" especially considering that the Yankees already employee a manager and a bunch of coaches to act in that capacity.

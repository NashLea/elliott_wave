As this is the case, if one then applied your formula (the carbon effect formula you discuss) as having accounted for the linear trend since 1880, when this trend was then already long-established, can only be done if one then adds that much more warming over and above the trend already long in place.<br /><br />The reality is that you can show the continuation of the trend, and I can show that it was long in place and has not deviated (except during a warm-phase or cool-phase wobble/excursion), and has not deviated overall despite all human carbon since the end of the LIA.<br /><br />To have your formula apply, it would have had to warm up that much more than the trend already in place, this has not happened, as a matter of objective fact.  The trend continued and did not advance or accelerate over the 13 decades you discuss, except as it wobbled.<br /><br />As we have not warmed up over and above the base trend long in place, as the early 20th century was hotter faster than the later 20th century, as the 1934 year was hotter than the 1998 year, etc ... The formula you advance cannot be valid, unless ... the past trend long in place ended exactly at 1880 and then your formula took over assuming nature simply agreed to provide no additional heat.  As the longer ago past of the climate establishes, this would be an extremely speculative assumption and is really impossible to prove or test.  But the fact that recent warmth is less than that of prior warmth and that global temperatures over the last 15 years have plateaud in any material way, even according to the CRU, again, the assumption that was so highly speculative (prior warming ceased all at once in 1880 then carbon took over), finds absolutely no objective scientific support.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://c3headlines.typepad.com/.a/6a010536b58035970c012875f55267970c-pi\" target=\"_blank\">http://c3headlines.typepad.com...</a><br /><br />The recent years of cooling are also objectively factual according the NCDC and UAH, et al.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://c3headlines.typepad.com/.a/6a010536b58035970c0120a7a8f49c970b-pi\" target=\"_blank\">http://c3headlines.typepad.com...</a><br /><br />Best Wishes<br />", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1421091, "replies": [], "lft": 46, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/a-dumb-question-about-stanching-deep-oil/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1930244, "rgt": 47, "userDisplayName": "R.

I never thought I would hear myself write that out loud.<br /><br />The environmental disaster unfolding before our eyes (close on the heels of coal mining disasters) has important long-term impacts in negative and positive ways on energy security, decarbonizing our energy systems, producing sufficiently abundant energy sources, maintaining economically robust energy prices, and protecting the environment.  It\u2019s a complicated and slow-moving nightmare. Obama took a beating by environmentalists for pushing to open up offshore oil and gas production, and this disaster just exacerbates it; I wonder if the loss in credibility with environmentalists because of this spill is enough to substantially undermine future energy policy initiatives. At the same time, he gained credibility with oil and gas, and by not giving up on his pledges for offshore production, is increasing his industrial credibility, which might enhance his ability to enact future energy policy initiatives because he\u2019ll get less opposition from them downstream.<br /><br />This is all very fascinating.  Obama looks like one of the losers in this, but in the end, I predict he\u2019ll be a winner because industry will \u201cowe\u201d him one, and environmentalists will come back around to support him.  And, as we worry about offshore production, increased safety regulations might increase prices, which will make renewables more competitive.  At the same time, bans on mountaintop removal mining will push coal producers underground, while underground mining will have steeper safety regulations, which will push the price of coal up, too. Consequently, renewables win again, too.  Natural gas is also one of the winners because people see the oil spill on the news and blame oil, but are likely to forget natural gas\u2019 likely culpability in the original explosion, and therefore natural gas might emerge unscathed as the clean, \u201csafe\u201d and domestic fuel.<br /><br />Regardless, swift action is better than slow, decisive action.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1417321, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/reinventing-hunters-point-and-other-highlights-from-fridays-bay-area-report/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1930192, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Aaron", "createDate": "1272762443", "userID": 59814262, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1272773897", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Santiago, Chile", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1272770297", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "I was involved in testing samples from Hunter's Point for toxic contaminants seven years ago.

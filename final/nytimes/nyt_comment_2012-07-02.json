They conceded first in three of their five matches. I know, I saw every match in person. The first goal they allowed, against the Soviet Union, was a horrible goalkeeping folly, a shot from the touch line almost 40 yards from goal that bounced, and bounced off of goalie Waldir Peres and into the net. And the penultimate goal that Brazil conceded that tournament, having leveled Italy in a match in which they only needed a draw, Toninho Cerezo, who otherwise had a marvelous tournament in midfield, mistakenly squared a pass right to Paolo Rossi who took it in and easily beat Peres again to give Italy a halftime lead. In today's game, either of those goals would get players benched and/or managers sacked. Brazil likely could have survived Peres dismal goalkeeping had Careca been healthy, or had Tele Santana played Socrates as deep lying center forward other than the misfiring Serginho. But the combination of terrible #1 AND #9, abetted by two mediocre center halves in Oscar and Luizinho, precludes Brazil 1982 from being discussed as one of the great teams never to win.

The inconveniences you detail are part of the process. Clearly if a person is fortunate to be admitted legally into the US, carrying what ever documents mandated by US law is a specific requirement that cannot be avoided, or if it is, one is not in compliance with US law, subject to whatever penalties are mandated by the US.<br/><br/>The simple fact is, if you are an illegal alien immigrant, you have broken US law; you have no right to be in the US. If you are hired to work, your employer breaks the law. If you misrepresent yourself to get a drivers license, or a Social Security card, you break the law. <br/><br/>Is it then so difficult to understand that the legal immigrant, obliged to carry whatever documents are specified by regulations to be in compliance with the law, is really not being imposed on in any way, simply to do the right thing ?<br/><br/>The immigration law needs to be updated and modern technology brought into play to enable legal immigrants to be safe in their country of choice while they wait for the specified period required on the path to citizenship. For illegal immigrants the competing factions will fight hard to support the various points of view.<br/><br/>The bottom line is the administration must seal the border with the able assistance of the states.

In all that time, including during my service in the US Army,  I was never asked to produce it, except on entering the US.<br/><br/>In the case of an illegal immigrant, there is no Green Card. Any Social Security card is fake or a duplicate and quite likely so is a drivers license.

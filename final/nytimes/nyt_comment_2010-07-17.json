I remain considerably underemployed at 60, and since I was self-employed, I don't have any unemployment benefits to fall back on, extended or not.<br /><br />Do I blame the Obama administration for much of this?  In terms of how we got here, the answer is no.  It's clear to me we're still living with the aftermath of a Republican administration that was determined to demolish public regulation of corporations and starve the Federal government of the funds required to do its job.  We'll see more attempts to \"kill the beast\" if the Republicans gain control of Congress in November.<br /><br />But in terms of where we should be going, I do think the Administration deserves at best a C-.  I would have preferred to see more stimulus funds devoted to major infrastructure investments and less to keeping state bureaucracies in place.  I would have preferred to see more of those funds used to shore up homeowners in trouble and help property owners finance renovation and reconstruction of properties in distressed areas.  Spending some of those stimulus funds on our collective resources like National Parks and Forests wouldn't have been a bad idea, either.  I would have preferred to see more monies spent on fixing bridges and dams, restoring our environment, and making investments in areas like high-speed rail that would have long-term benefits. Spending on these types of activities would have put a lot of Americans to work, many of whom are type kinds of people who now flock to Tea Party rallies.  Instead we have a Democratic administration that has way too many connections with Wall Street and far too few connections with working people and small entrepreneurs.<br /><br />In the foreign policy arena, the traditional Democratic fear of appearing weak on security has led the Administration to continue to prosecute wars that made no sense when Obama came to office and less sense now. I had some hopes that Obama would staff his national security agencies with people who understood how limited our ability to influence foreign events has become and would begin an intelligent withdrawal from our over-extended military posture.  I wanted to see a real commitment to cutting the defense budget (by 50% in a decade at least).  Other than making some reductions in our obviously over-sized nuclear arsenal, I don't see much enthusiasm for any of these policies in the White House.<br /><br />I wanted to see a clear commitment to single-payer health insurance rather than back-room deals with pharmaceutical companies and private insurers.<br /><br />I also wanted to see an Administration that professed a clear commitment to re-establishing civil liberties by renouncing policies like rendition and unlawful wiretapping.  I wanted to see enforcement of free speech on the Internet and policies designed to keep those who own the channels of communication from controlling the content they carry.  I wanted to see a return to rational policies in the areas of copyright and patents rather than ones dictated by Hollywood and corporate interests.<br /><br />Mostly I wanted to see that \"change\" I was promised.  I voted for Obama because he seemed more intelligent than most any presidential candidate who has run for the office in my lifetime, and because he seemed committed to the  public interest and redistribution rather than continuing to reward private wealth and power. I expected Obama to use his incisive mind and obvious strengths of communication to take advantage of the \"bully pulpit\" that is the Presidency and lead our country.  Instead I got a Presidency that has deferred too often to a Congress that, on both sides of the aisle, spends far too much time worrying about the needs of K Street and far too little time worrying about the people that elect them.<br />", "recommendationCount": 274}, {"assetID": 1659962, "replies": [], "lft": 62, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/opinion/17blow.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2269626, "rgt": 63, "userDisplayName": "Debra Garson", "createDate": "1279344506", "userID": 26200051, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1279344728", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYS", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1279341128", "commentSequence": 12, "commentBody": "President Obama needed a bigger stimulus the first time. He needs another stimulus, but I do not think that he has the political will to try for another one. The economy is not rebounding at all. Unemployment is not budging, and without a real rebound in employment, people will not see the economy turning around. If Obama tried for another stimulus to create jobs, those people would spend more money and pay more in taxes. This would ripple through the economy. The more business sells, the more business is likely to begin hiring again. Obama has done a extremely poor job of explaining to the American people how everything is connected. That is his failing.<br /><br />Making comparisons to Reagan does not seem appropriate. Reagan was not dealing with a damaged financial system, a speculative housing bubble that went \"bust,\" and trillions of dollars of lost money. Millions of Americans have seen their savings decimated, and that loss will be one of the greatest and lasting impacts of this Great Recession. The government will not mention how much money people lost ever again. That will be brushed under the rug with everything else.<br /><br />I will be looking at the financial markets. The financial markets are indicating a poor economy. The health of the financial markets truly influences my votes. Obama should know that there are Independents like me with investments now sitting on the sidelines due to the uncertainty that he is creating. Obama is just not a clear communicator about the issues, how he wants to tackle them and in what direction the Democratic Party is headed. Obama's gift for communicating seems to be while campaigning. I did not fall for Obama's words. I am not disappointed. I did not expect much, and the Democrats have not done much.<br /><br />Every piece of so-called landmark legislation was so watered down that it is all virtually useless. All the legislation is riddled with loopholes to be exploited.<br /><br />The Democrats failed to seize crises facing this country and take bold action. The Democrats appear weak. They are just as infested with special interests as the Republicans, which is why the Democrats cannot do anything signicant.<br /><br />Obama's biggest nightmare---UNEMPLOYMENT.

Are we talking about the same Gucci Fall 2003 RTW? If you worked in the fashion industry, you would not say those collections are the same. I went back and looked at that collection to see if what was said had any validity, because what was being said didn't ring that strong of a bell, and not only was the palette different (which color should I begin with?), and some of the textures, but that Gucci collection was heavier, more dramatic. Sure, there were some faint similarities, particularly in a couple of the garments with harnesses, but this was a lighter, more focused, unburdened affair. Night and day. Tom Ford is not the first designer to put straps on gowns. Even if you didn't work in the fashion industry, you'd have to be half blind to say Altuzarra was like Gucci Fall 2003, and really stretch, over-generalize. I'm aghast. I thought Altuzarra was completely relevant for now. Everything in that Gucci collection had way more volume.

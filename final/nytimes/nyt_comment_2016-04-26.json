Krugman suggests that we should see the tax-as-revenue issue as linked with the policy that it funds. But I don't see why that's the case. Pre-K in Philadelphia could be funded a lot of different ways. Some of those ways are less regressive than a soda tax. So it seems like the regressivity of the tax understood as a way to pay for something is a separate issue from the progressivity of what it's supposed to pay for.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to think of the tax as a way to change behavior. Normally, we don't think that restricting someone's option set, either by raising the cost of some options or by preventing them outright, is justified if it's done solely on the basis of the good of the person being so restricted. It seems like rational people ought to be able to decide what's in their own good; it's not clear why the state should take money from them up to the point that the better angels of their natures kick in. But then the issue is more complicated because it involves family purchases that may affect children. I'm not sure if that's a sufficient justification for a paternalistic tax or not.

I'd say that this piece was revived because it seemed like a fun thing to do, with a star that would give it new life (i.e. \"revival\").  The script was updated and JTF's performance is pretty amazing.  Let's keep in mind that the $147 price noted in this strange review is the top dollar price -- you can come and see it for 1/3 of that if you like, and having sat in the cheap seats myself I can say that it was a perfectly wonderful evening in the theatre.

Meanwhile, I have seen Jews, Christians, and other religious groups call out extremists who are on their end, but almost never for the Muslims.  In some cases there have been Muslims that have been killed just for calling out such groups like those Palestinians that were killed recently in the Gaza Strip just for protesting against Hamas.  Had more of the media covered that besides the Jerusalem Post and a few others, that would have exposed Hamas for who they really are.  Seriously, what are these comparisons?  What was done in Dresden was during a time of war, and that's something completely different to comparing it to a terrorist attack, which is usually done during a time of peace.  Also, the group known as Irgun, who was known for doing the Kind David Hotel bombing, there is more to know about that.  They never actually intended to kill anyone and they even give a prior warning to the British military that was there before even setting off the bomb and to evacuate before it went off, but they didn't seem to get that message.

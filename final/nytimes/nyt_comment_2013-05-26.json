Because, airlines needed hefty profit margins to be able to spend a lot of $ on safety that they could then advertise. So they needed guaranteed moneymaking routes. Once the airlines were deregulated, it was hard to make $ and powerful shareholders were pressing airlines to shave on costs &amp; safety. They competed on price instead.That's why, I think, there weren't doors on cockpits-it wouldn't have been hard, &amp; prior to 9/11, a prescient stewardess pleaded with the executives to install doors, 2 no avail. There were lots of things that could have been done to prevent terrorism, but airlines, to save $, went for a pretense of prevention, by making a big deal of how alarmed they were whenever some 8 year old boy made a joke about a bomb on the plane-just public relations, pretending they cared.As I said, airlines still aren't safe and no one wants to get on one-it's a miserable experience. So instead,the rich have their Lear jets and chartered flights(on which, they have some control on who else is onboard-that makes it safer), and just as in 1976, it costs lots 2 get a decent safe flight.

NMR [Nuclear Magnetic Resonance] had to be renamed MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] to get sick people into the scanner.  It is the exact same machine.  Only the sign has been changed.  Apparently, the average American doesn't know that all matter, including people, is made of atoms and that atoms have nuclei.  The NMR/MRI machine aligns the spins of the nuclei in the atoms in the patient using a big magnet.

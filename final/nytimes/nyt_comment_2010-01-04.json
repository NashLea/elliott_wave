For the Bengals to lose intentionally to the Jets (which they may have indeed done) to avoid having to play a much stronger team in week one of the playoffs is the same as throwing a game.<br /><br />The strength of the NFL came on the shoulders of owners like Wellington Mara and Art Rooney, men who realized that in order to have a sport that flourished, every team would have to benefit, small city teams like Green Bay as well as big city teams like Chicago, all playing by the same rules.<br /><br />With teams now taking dives late in the season, that sense of \"alll for one and one for all\" has vanished and fans will not long stand for it.<br /><br />Once the integrity of the NFL is questioned, there will be a lessening of the six-month-long love affair millions of people have had with professional football.<br /><br />The answer is not to award teams that have already clinched post-season positions with extra draft picks if they play their regulars. That would be counterproductive to the whole idea of the draft in the first place which was to give teams with poorer records an opportunity to advance through adroit draft picks.<br /><br />Rather, a committee should determine that if a team doesn't care whether it wins or loses a late season game based on their use of available personnel, that team should then suffer a loss of placement in the following year's draft. There are questions of judgement that will arise, to be sure. The committee will have to be judicious and fair in setting up criteria for enforcement of the penalties.<br /><br />But to do nothing will cause the NFL further concerns and risk greater alienation amongst its fans.

First of all Adu is playing in Portugal which was one of the first european countries to play  african players in its national team..two mozambicans played for Portugal at the 1966 World cup and these two single handedly propelled Portugal to a semi-final spot. The number of Africans playing for top european clubs and teams in the all the leagues across Europe from portugal, england, France and indeed we have africans in Georgia, kazakistan, Armenia, Uzebekistan, Turkey to Finland etc etc...shows you that scouts are actively seeking african players and that race is a non factor.<br />The problem i see with Adu was the hype surrounding him at a young age.  I think his skill is good enough; his stature is similar to Messi,  and he is creative ( as seen at Canada 2007 under 20 World cup).  The U.S national team is a team not known for creativity so to this end Adu will not find the light of day on a U.S team especially with Bob Bradley at the helm.  I think Adu will rue the day he forfeited his chance to play for the country of birth; the black stars of Ghana.  If someone had provided guidance to Adu, then he might have turned out to be the U.S  version of Messi.  It is much to do with the coaches tactics..and I think Adu is good enough to play for the US team if they know how to use him.

They have failed to bridge the gap between the level of competition in the US with the type of soccer being played at the club level overseas . The type of competition we see can be very weak at times . Too many games with meaningless outcomes .<br /><br />The league should start to incorporate a system of promotion and relegation between the USL teams . Consolidate all the regional MLS divisions and make that the MLS Premier League . Compare with the European leagues where some of the most watchable soccer from this point forward will be at games where one or both of the teams playing are fighting off relegation . I'm sure it's not as simple as all that , but then , maybe it is.<br /><br />This league set-up will instill a higher level of competitiveness in the players . Currently , once you get past the top 8-10 players in the league , it's doubtful that any of the rest would even make the first team squad of top league clubs elsewhere . Consequently , when the US players go overseas , they are fringe players at best , except for the top talent like Dempsey , Howard , Donovan , etc . The league has to start to diversify its ownership and start to pay young players comparable money to make it worthwhile for foreign players to play here . This market has the potential to be a \"farm\" league for the European leagues the way that Brazil and Argentina have become . I totally understand that it is difficult to make that comparison but we have to start somewhere . MLS players simply do not get top class competition week in , week out . Also , there needs to be more interaction with leagues in Mexico and South America where MLS teams might one day be invited to play in Copa tournaments .<br /><br />Some might say pie in the sky and I know some of the hurdles that the league faces in trying to make any soccer league in the US a viable financial option , but they are falling behind badly , and we all know what happens when the rot sets in finally.<br /><br />I guess the poster child for the failings of MLS players overseas unfortunately is Freddy Adu . Christened the \"New Pele\" when his made his MLS debut in 2004 at the hotly disputed age of 14 yrs old . He had a checkered rookie season with DC United and rumors suggested that even Manchester United were interested in signing him as a youth player . His appearances dwindled as issues about playing time surfaced with the coaching staff and Man Utd lost interest due to the ridiculous price that the MLS stuck on his head . Benfica eventually came in and signed him up but his appearances have been few and far between to the point where he was loaned out to first AS Monaco, and then Beleneses . Both of those two teams declined to buy him and sent him back to Benfica where he now wallows on their bench . A sad tale but a typical one.<br /><br />It appears that the MLS is more concerned about image and appearance than it is about content and truly developing talent which is a shame because there is as much talent on the soccer fields of the US at ages 12-16 than anywhere else in the world . It's what happens afterwards that is cause for concern.<br /><br />It's no good just naming your pro teams like the world famous clubs. You have to get them to play like them too.......................................<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.soccerlimeyinamerica&gt;com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.soccerlimeyinamerica&gt;com</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 999464, "replies": [], "lft": 34, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/the-decade-in-soccer-hints-of-a-new-order/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1363811, "rgt": 35, "userDisplayName": "Heff", "createDate": "1262572870", "userID": 14868444, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1262583002", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boston", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1262583002", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "This may be peripheral and petty, but I think the photo accompanying the newspaper piece was a ridiculous selection.

We had the attic room &amp; our friends had the family room. Our friends arrived a day ahead of us, but we all received a transfer from the airport (return also) as part of the deal which was great.  nothing was too much trouble. The Hotel is in a fantastic location, only 5-10min walk to the Mosques &amp; Topkapi Palace &amp; about a 15min walk to the Grand Bazaar. There is a huge selection of restaurants only one street away which is another bonus. If you want to experience the Sultanahmet area we could not think of a better place to stay. The hotel terrace was great, both in the evening for a pre dinner drink with views of both of the Mosques all lit up &amp; also in the morning for the terrific breakfast, with views out over the Marmara Sea &amp; the Asian side of Istanbul. The rooms are not the biggest we have ever stayed in, but they were very comfortable &amp; clean &amp; the air conditioning was great which was important! If you don't like stairs then this hotel may not be for you - but if you like the idea of keeping fit while you are trying all the Turkish fare then you won't mind in the least!

It's very expensive (60 euros) and the driver drove like crazy, typing messages on his cell-phone while doing 160 kph in the traffic, and shouting at the other cars that didn't open him the way. Some people may enjoy it though. We didn't.<br /><br />On the way back, we took a normal shuttle service (appointed for us by the hotel staff), we paid 5 euro per person, the minibus of course stopped at few other hotels to take passengers, but the ride was ", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 936, "replies": [], "lft": 62, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/arizona/tucson/restaurants.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3101932, "rgt": 63, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1262592410", "userID": 27013064, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1262592410", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "userSuggestion", "updateDate": "1262622930", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "If you are planning the short trip to Nogales Mexico from Tucson  make sure to stop  off in Sonoita  and have  a meal  at Cafe Canela.. a  favourite of  Arizona Highways  magazine with a focus  on local food and wine..

Several good computer security companies are working to stop spam, but several countries will not cooperate. China, Brazil and some Eastern European countries, and of course Nigeria.<br/><br/>There is a huge network of infected computers known as netbots, that are controlled by other netbots.  there are companies that track and document these spammers, and provide the information to ISPs and government agencies for blocking. You can go to <a href=\"http://Spamhaus.org\" title=\"Spamhaus.org\" target=\"_blank\">Spamhaus.org</a> to see one effort, but the other problem is many major providers refuse to block large blocks of IP numbers. The backbone operators such as AT&amp;$, will not block a whole country such as China, even though they are a major source of spam.<br/><br/>The whole system depends on the root servers that also would have to be configured to block these sources, and that would probably bring the internet to a halt.<br/><br/>So in many cases, the spammers are well known, but they can not be stopped by any authorities. Another reason is the Direct Mailing Association that prevented laws allowing you to sue spammers. They got the Can Spam Law also known as the You can spam law, when states had legislation to allow suing spammers. So you have to opt out when you get spam, instead of telling companies it is OK, you have to wait until you are spammed by a member of the DMA before you can tell then no.<br/><br/>Again, look who gets their way, and it is not you."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10979386, "replies": [], "commentID": 10980186, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "mobocracy", "createDate": "1390051819", "userID": 48114248, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1390053134", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 8, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "JPG", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "minneapolis", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1390053134", "commentSequence": 10980186, "commentBody": "It's a great question why the NSA's surveillance apparatus ins't apaprently used much to target this kind of banking fraud.

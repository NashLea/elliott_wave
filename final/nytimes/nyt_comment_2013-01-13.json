The community's 2001 Park Plan (that got funded from the city and state's capital budget) included a skating half-pipe and green lawns for the community on this piece of land,  and there was no discussion of having to purchase the land from Con Ed at that time. Those discussions obviously took place once the park was claimed for luxury high rise housing. And why shouldn't Con Ed try to get some piece of that profitable luxury condo crazed-flesh? It is an abomination to anyone who realizes the scam of this real estate deal that deprives the children of Brooklyn much needed land for recreation - for a park and not another highrise luxury condo development that we the citizens are paying for with our tax dollars. This is a total and complete scam.

As a rape survivor, I appreciate hearing at least one man call for attention to these crimes. <br/><br/>I always wonder why more men don't join forces to prevent rape. It is in their best interest to do so. If heterosexual men want women to desire sexual relationships with them, they should be very motivated to prevent rape. After heterosexual women are raped they are much less likely to desire sexual relationships with men and may take months or years to be able to do so with partners they already have. <br/><br/>It saddens me that so many men fail to confront the rapists among them. It's as if it doesn't matter, it's not that important, it's a woman's problem. But eventually it will be a man's problem when that woman is now traumatized by any sexual activity.

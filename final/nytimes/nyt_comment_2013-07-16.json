We should develop institutions where ambition counters ambition, not a system where we have blind faith that somehow political grudges will not arise.<br/><br/>For a more thoughtful legal and economic case study of a public-private partnership, consider the public purchase of a hockey arena in Columbus, Ohio, where political pressure is present and intellectual reasoning is suspect.

And you know what? We all still support this change because no reasonable person thinks what the Republicans are doing, shutting down entire federal agencies through their intransigence, is acceptable. So we are happy to live under a system where neither party can do that. If the Republican party decides to use the response to the situation they created as an excuse to entirely undue the filibuster, which Democrats repeatedly have not done, that is on them. <br/><br/>As far as \"heed the concerns of the opposition party\" goes, you must have been one of those Republicans (i.e. the majority) who thought that Romney was going to win, and that all the scientific evidence saying otherwise was a liberal conspiracy from the liberal (fill in the blank) pollsters. Obama has nominated Republicans to cabinet level positions, over the strong objection of most liberals. So frankly I have no idea what you are talking about. He is trying to \"stymie\" the concerns of the minority by appointing qualified people he wants to the branch of government he runs? <br/><br/>You know it is perfectly fine to have a strong political conviction, whether liberal or conservative. But that should not blind you to the obvious. Every party does stupid and inappropriate things from time to time. In this instance, it's clearly the Republicans. Acknowledging that doesn't make you disloyal; it makes you rational.

In order to do that, it must be difficult for a Senator to invoke a filibuster. If it is a principle over tactics go for it. But in the future a Senator must speak on the floor of the Senate and not be able to filibuster by writing in and requesting it --- the mantra should be: <br/><br/>No Filibuster in Abstensia!!!!!<br/><br/>This ax cuts both ways but clearly the Senate is broken.

Dr. Krugman is right to remind us that household de-leveraging and the surplus of savings over investment are the main reasons our economy is sub-par.  Just how big are these issues?<br/><br/>Regarding deleveraging: From 2000-2008, households added $260 billion per quarter to their debt level, about 1.9% GDP.  Since the crisis, we've been paying it down about $50 billion per quarter, about 0.4% GDP.  This is a 2.3% GDP swing due to deleveraging, a huge drag on the economy.  This means that most of our economic growth during the Bush years was due to private borrowing and spending.  The government has to step in and provide that demand.<br/><br/>Further, the gap between savings and investment remains about $800 billion, when these numbers used to move in tandem.  Dr. Krugman graphed this in his blog post called \"The Problem\" some time ago.  Housing investment is still $400 billion below peak. If companies won't spend it, we tax it away from them. Corporate taxes are about 1.7% GDP, versus 2.7% GDP in 2007 and 2.5% GDP in the OECD.<br/><br/>Economies are built one job at a time.  We created about 20 million jobs each decade from 1970-2000, but only about 4 million jobs since then.  There are two big debates going on right now, the \"Austerity vs. Stimulus\" debate (which is about budget deficits and debt) and the \"Structural vs. Cyclical\" debate (which is about jobs).

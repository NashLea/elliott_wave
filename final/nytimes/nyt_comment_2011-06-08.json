When the discussion of effects is in terms of how strong the field is, I think it misses this crucial aspect.  Here's a 2010 synopsis:  <br/><br/>\"The effects of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of synaptosomal membranes were investigated. Sinusoidal fields with 50\u2009Hz frequency and different amplitudes caused AChE activity to decrease about 27% with a threshold of about 0.74\u2009mT. The decrease in enzymatic activity was independent of the time of permanence in the field and was completely reversible. Identical results were obtained with exposure to static MF of the same amplitudes. Moreover, the inhibitory effects on enzymatic activity are spread over frequency windows with different maximal values at 60, 200, 350, and 475\u2009Hz. When synaptosomal membranes were solubilized with Triton, ELF-MF did not affect AChE activity, suggesting the crucial role of the membrane, as well as the lipid linkage of the enzyme, in determining the conditions for inactivation. The results are discussed in order to give an interpretation at molecular level of the macroscopic effects produced by ELF-MF on biological systems, in particular the alterations of embryo development in many organisms due to acetylcholine accumulation.\" Bioelectromagnetics 31:270\u2013276, 2010. \u00a9 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2806350, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/realestate/colonials-tudors-and-soon-a-casino.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3958683, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "APLLESAUCE", "createDate": "1307505229", "userID": 63044381, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1307505836", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "bronx,ny", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1307502236", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "i think it s wonderful only in that it will bring what makes this world go 'round:JOBS so yeah the casinos are always a good thing in that respect and we should all be ever the more grateful if only for that GOD BLESS! queens.

Cell phone use causes increased glucose metabolism. In other words your brain is functioning when you use a cell phone!!. I should hope so!<br/>\nDo you realize that  glucose metabolism is a human body function that produces oxygen ions (oxidants) as a side effect. The body also produces anti-oxidants to reduce the number, BECAUSE oxidants are ions which are capable of ripping an atom out of a DNA molecule and thus producing a DNA defect which sometimes results in cancer. BINGO! a physical link from cell phones to cancer. Trouble is  the cell phone cause is trivial compared to the cause of just plain living. It takes more energy (glucose metabolism) to eat, breathe, walk and talk etc than to use a cell phone, and this is probably trivial compared to the higher levels of radiation  from the sun to which we are all exposed. AND without the sunlight we would all die. So the precautionary principle choice becomes stop breathing oxygen or live with the risk of oxident induced cancer.<br/><br/>So we have established that there is a level of risk to cell phones that induces increased communication, and to eating and breathing that produces oxidant ions that allows functioning, and a level of risk to gasoline and fuel that allows increased transportation (&amp; auto accidents) etc. We also have a WHO investigative branch that has resulted in more use of dangerous printers ink and PC display radiation by publishing a study  that scared the bejesus out of the unsuspecting ignorant gullible public, by using an absurd grading system (\"possible\" carcinogen).<br/><br/>What is needed is a much much better WHO grading system, to be able to compare the relative risks/rewards and cost/benefits of various elements compounds and technologies. Right now we have a cancer risk coming from breathing oxygen, that is far more dangerous than the low \"possible\" cancer risk (if any!)/high reward of a cell phone. Logically we should ban breathing to prevent cancer (ignoring other consequences!) before we tackle the much smaller problem of cell phones. This is implicitly in place by the FCC  etc in restricting cell phone radiation to a small fraction of that what is known to cause problems.<br/><br/>Then there is the problem that the publicity of the WHO non-finding has caused more worrying by mothers concerned about their children, which in turn has caused more glucose metabolism and so more cancer than the report was worth in the first place.<br/><br/>In summary, it is my feeling that  the crazy world is worrying about a trivial problem with cell phone radiation.

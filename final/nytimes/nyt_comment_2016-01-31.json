They can look black in the right light (see Franz Lanting's amazing photos). These trees were 300 years old when they died 500 years ago, as the shifting red dunes blocked off their access to water. Since then, the air is too dry for them to rot, so they stand. Wind and age have removed all the twigs and small branches, so they stand as humanlike twisted trunks, looking like they have bodies and arms. Their dancerlike poses are what makes them so compelling in photographs. Plus the starkness of the deep blue sky, and the thousand-foot red dunes that can be made to fill the horizon. Add the chalky flat desert floor, and you have some stunning colors. It is a photographer's paradise, because you can endlessly blend different ratios of white, red, blue, and the black silhouette trunks or their shadows, depending on your perspective and camera angle. The openness of the landscape lets you move about to compose the trees as any size or proportion of your frame that you wish.

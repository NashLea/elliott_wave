I agree with some of the criticisms including Rima's criticism of the Democratic Party.  However, the blame for the resurgence of the knee-jerk nihilist party belongs with the folks who voted for the Republicans solely to spite the Democrats and much more so with those who didn't vote at all.

The US electorate proves yet again that they make voting choices that they know will hurt them. When GW Bush \"won\" his second term, the reactions pretty much anywhere around the world were predominantly of shock as people wondered how we could hand power back to someone who was clearly a poor choice, a tool in the hands of not-too-hidden interests.  A UK tabloid summed it up in a headline: \"How Can 59 Million People Be So Dumb?\" Well, we've done it again.<br/><br/>GWB's second term led to a decline in the economy and the nation entangled in two seemingly interminable wars. The past 4 years have seen a clear sign of GoP obstruction to getting anything done in Congress and now they have been rewarded for it. In their own words they laid out a plan to work with the Democrats... and now this behavior is rewarded. Brilliant, isn't it?<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like the result or not - I would be in favor of voting out whichever party did a bad job. The point is that the data clearly show where the problems are and yet we repeat our mistakes.

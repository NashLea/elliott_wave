Loved ones of the victims were allowed to speak at Roof\u2019s bail hearing. The author quoted Nadine Collier, the daughter of seventy year old Ethel Lance in the article in which Nadine stated during trial directed to Dylann Roof (the murderer), \u201cYou took something very precious away from me.  I will never talk to her again. I will never hold her hand again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\u201d I believe that Collier was not only trying to teach Roof a lesson but was also trying to show that there is more room for forgiveness than hate. I enjoyed reading this article because of the positive message it teaches everyone. No good comes from hate and anger. We must love and forgive. I find it extremely disturbing that Roof could go into the church during Bible study and sit with people for a whole hour and then go ahead and start shooting them.

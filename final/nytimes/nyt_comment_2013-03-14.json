This is not the first time Indian media behaves in this immature way - it happened when they literally launched a campaign of hatred against Australia in 2009.

Firstly, if this incident happened near Italy and an Indian ship had killed two Italian fishermen as a result of some misunderstanding, the local media and the politicians would not have latched on to this case in this manner and we would not have seen the kind of breathless reporting that we saw in Kerala/India causing the local politicians to rush to take advantage of this situation. In the beginning, India insisted that the incident happened in Indian waters, later the Indian govt had to concede in court that this was a lie - the incident happened in what is called the contiguous zone, not in Indian waters (and according to maritime anaysts no country has exclusive jurisdiction over contiguous zones). Italy offered to conduct a joint investigation which India rejected. Instead of sticking to the specifics of this case and resolving the matter through international arbitration in accordance with the Law of the Seas, the Indian media made it an issue of national prestige thereby needlessly escalating this issue. (and lets admit that in a country where institutions have weak public legitimacy like in India, there is often a tendency to play to the galleries). It was a mistake for the Italian government to not return the marines after giving an undertaking in the courts to do so, but Indian media/society has also failed to display a mature outlook. Other countries will take you more seriously when you behave like an adult.

So are the listeners in Somalia or are they citizens of the world and entitled to hear from the world at large?  As for Radio Free Europe I hate to break it to you but that is not news.  I don't know about this prohibition of distribution of government content to Americans, etc. but, guess what, everyone was in the military during the wars and mostly oversees and exposed to Radio Free Europe even if we weren't listening to it domestically.  It wasn't a secret.  Nor a secret that it was American/allied made news.

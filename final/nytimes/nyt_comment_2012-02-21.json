Observations of chimpanzees also buttress this aspect of primate behavior - altruism and empathy are situational. Chimps are far from being always greedy and selfish. As are humans, regardless of how they got their marbles. Of mammals that live in organized societies, empathy and altruism are the rule, not the exception - because the whole point of societies is survival. Haidt even points this out, but then abandons it to focus on the behavior of 3-year-olds with their marbles. <br/><br/>Media love Professor Haidt because he's TV-ready and well-spoken.

Anything less than a trillion wasn't serious. On top of that about 45% of the stimulus was in tax breaks - a contributing factor to the cause of the crisis. Nevertheless, it reversed the collapsing trend in employment - the famous bikini curve. But growth in employment took more than a year to return. By that time millions of lives had been irreparably harmed.<br/><br/>The problem with the stimulus, in some degree is similar with the problem with the ACA: <br/><br/>Obama negotiated against himself even before real debate and bargaining began. His campaign for public option was thrown under the bus, as was single payer.<br/><br/>A characteristic of Obama's administration is he campaigns well for his own job, but phones it in for others. He truly fights for little other than his own job.

The choice of Tubman was not about pandering to a base. While Roosevelt is an incredibly important person in US History, the magnitude of what Tubman did and the courage she had during the American Civil War is more important than Roosevelt.

Her contribution is as important as the many Germans and Polish people including Oskar Schindler that went against the Nazi's and hid the Jewish people, knowing full well that if caught they would die the same wretched death as the Jewish. I'm pretty sure you do not object to the bravery of the Europeans but in this case do not think highly of Tubman.

Not only does the 14th Amendment very clearly include birthright citizenship, not only has it been very clearly understood to include birthright citizenship from the moment it was presented for a vote, not only had the concept been a part of American common law from the start of migration to North America, but it originated in English common law before the Western Hemisphere was 'discovered'.  The concept of birthright citizenship first came under attack during the Irish famine migration to the U.S. in the 1840s and, again, during the later Italian migration; but there has never actually been any plausible argument that the 14th Amendment did not include the concept.  Modern radical revisionists, however, pretending to be 'conservative' while typically acting in ways which strongly belie use of the term, have apparently decided that since the 14th Amendment is more than one hundred years old most Americans won't have any clue as to its existence or history and can easily be duped into accepting their/your absurdly ridiculous and false characterization of it.

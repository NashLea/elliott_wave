The short term rate is 0.1 degrees C per century, which indicates that there is no acceleration but rather a decrease in rate. <br/><br/>Therefore, where is the catastrophic warming? <br/><br/>The argument has always been that rates of global warming are faster than anything the biosphere has ever endured before, and that therefore catastrophe is at hand.

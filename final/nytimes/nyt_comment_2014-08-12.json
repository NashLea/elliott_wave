My son's school requires teachers to post grades and assignments online, which seems like it would eliminate all sorts of problems for the disorganized student. And it does eliminate some--but at the cost of creating many, many others. The worst problem so far has been that some teachers really take to heart the flexibility made available by the online environment, and homework is sometimes posted hours after the school day has ended. But the student doesn't know when an assignment will appear, so throughout the afternoon and evening he has to return repeatedly to the teacher's blog (or reporting system, or email blast, or moodle, or whatever other seemingly random and unique medium is selected by that individual teacher). Another significant problem my son experienced was that each teacher required different methods for submitting homework online, and there were frequent glitches. In one teacher's system, my son couldn't always tell if an assignment had been \"accepted,\" which led to repeated attempts, emails to the teacher (\"I'm not sure my assignment logged in so just in case I am sending you a screenshot...\"), printing out a copy as a backup, anxiety about whether the teacher would give credit....  <br/><br/>What a frustration.

You can just ask the clinic or donor agency for donors who are willing. If you seek treatment in the UK, she'll be known; anonymity is against the law there. In contrast, if you go to the Czech Republic or Spain, non-anonymity is against the law... so it depends where you go. Also, if you have a young enough relative or friend to donate, that eliminates anonymity and also is much less expensive.<br/><br/>But quite apart from that, adopting from any foreign country typically means you'll be raising a child who will never know *100%* of its genetic roots (though there are exceptions). And adopting from the US can mean the child won't know 50% of its genetic roots, since sometimes the bio-dad is unknown to the birth mother or she refuses to reveal his identity.<br/><br/>Long story short, one of the side effects of infertility is that if you get to raise a child at all, that child usually will never know at least one of its genetic parents. At least with egg donation (or sperm donation), if you use your husband's sperm (or your own egg), the child not only knows but is raised by one of its genetic parents--unlike adopted children. Also, thanks to sites like the Donor Sibling Registry, they may well be able to connect with genetic half-siblings even if they never connect with the donor herself (or himself).", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3378154, "replies": [], "lft": 334, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/confessions-of-a-mother-who-couldnt-say-no/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9582469, "rgt": 335, "userDisplayName": "Jules", "createDate": "1374974305", "userID": 26326778, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1374984280", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Halifax, NS", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1374980680", "commentSequence": 57, "commentBody": "When I was a kid growing up in Toronto, I was allowed to walk to school alone at 6 (3 blocks away), walk the dog alone during daylight hours at 6, to take the subway by myself at 9 and to babysit at the ripe old age of 12 (CPR certification in hand).<br/><br/>When our daughter was 8, my husband and I lived in Ottawa, in a very safe, pretty posh neighbourhood called the Glebe.

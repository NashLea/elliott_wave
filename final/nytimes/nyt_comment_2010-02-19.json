First, as much as we'd like to pretend otherwise, social stratification is endemic to the social order. What made America distinctive was not that we were a classless society, but that those class lines were not static and that the opportunity for social mobility existed here in a way that it didn't in Europe. Of course, racial, ethnic, and gender divides consistently stood/stand out as evidence that our ideal was not realized, but the objective remains. Second, educators persist in pretending that we can create a system in which merit is rewarded while at the same time avoiding social stratification. We can't. Doctors will always have higher status than file clerks, engineers will always have higher status than sales representatives. And third, no education system is designed for all Americans will ever assure that all or even most of its students will find dynamic careers in fields that require great creativity, critical thinking, and passion, despite a world of educators, administrators, and public figures who never admit this truth.<br /><br />For the past several decades, this utopic rhetorical framework I've described has pervaded K-12 education. We've witnessed a frantic drive to see every boy and girl grow up to go to college and \"make something of themselves.\" The result, however, has been troubling. Social promotion, lower standards, a proliferation of shockingly mediocre to pathetic colleges (they sell themselves like exercise equipment, so that, in just minutes a day, at your convenience, you can get your degree), and diminished expectations at many established colleges and universities has been the result. All in the name of pretending that everyone has the right to \"success,\" rather than an equal right to choose a path that may lead to what he or she imagines success to be.<br /><br />Dr. Stotsky's comments are the most salient, in my opinion, in that she addresses the desperate need for developing strong vocational training opportunities beginning in high school. These programs will always command lower social status, but at the very least, we can stop stigmatizing them by continuing to perpetuate the idea that \"college\" is the only path to salvation (because by now, most college degrees at the 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. are glorified vocational training programs anyway).<br /><br />Couple this with an expansion of labor unions, real universal health care, and national standards for four weeks of paid vacation time for employees, and pretty soon you've created a situation where these lower status positions can lead to a life every bit as enjoyable and fulfilling as the so-called high status careers.<br /><br />At that point, the task will be on making sure that kids aren't slotted for the vo-tech track or the college prep track based on a range of cultural prejudices that continue to plague our society. But at least a framework will exist that may enhance the dignity of kids who aren't excited by studying traditional subjects, while sparing those who are taken by a serious college curriculum from living in a universe of low expectations and minimal challenge.<br /><br />The 10th grade graduation plan seems to be aiming for something like that, but falls short in what appears to be a lack of a serious vocational training plan (they pass it all off to community colleges), no attention to the problem of childhood development and the process of maturation, another set of standardized tests to do the \"weeding\" (see Botstein), and reliance on a teaching staff that hasn't been trained to re-think these issues. But the only way we'll make things better is through experimentation, so...why not?<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 95}, {"assetID": 1174520, "replies": [], "lft": 554, "assetURL": "http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/feeling-guilty-about-your-purebred-dog/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1587831, "rgt": 555, "userDisplayName": "amandab13", "createDate": "1266555447", "userID": 46037117, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266556648", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Portland Metro Area", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266556648", "commentSequence": 272, "commentBody": "The BBC documentary about this topic was eye opening and heartbreaking.

We are both third-year Case Western Reserve University students and graduates of northeastern Ohio high schools.  In a state where, from all factual information we can gather, the high school graduation rates rarely rise above 80 percent and a city where roughly one in three studetns will graduate high school, we find this 10th grade graduation proposal somewhat troubling.<br /><br />Ohio's graduation criteria require a set of core classwork along with what is known as the Ohio Graduation Test.  The OGT demands that a student must have a tenth grade knowledge of basic subjects (math, reading, social studies, etc.) in order to graduate high school.  Considering the stats referenced above, particularly those for Cleveland, it seems readily apparent that either the test is completely inadequate to assess a student's abilities or else the education preceding the test that ought to enable students to gain the necessary skills to is seriously flawed.<br /><br />This leaves us with two different outcomes, neither of which commend the program at hand.  Either we can't make good standardized tests (and the ubiquity of the SAT and ACT for college admissions seems to disqualify this option) or what we're really looking at is fundamental problems in the education itself.  We believe this program flaunts novelty in a stagnant system, but completely fails to address the substantive issue at hand: which is education.  When students don't  have a rudimentary education, why should we attempt to move them onwards into a more difficult setting?<br /><br />What the country really needs is a long, hard look at the current education system.  More than novel approaches that fail to address the real issue, we need to focus on correcting education at the elementary level and work from there.  In this respect we agree with much of what Mr. Vern Williams states.  As a perhaps less substantive point (though perhaps not) throwing a sixteen year-old into college mix seems a wildly misguided approach.  In an era of wide-reaching government regulation, including enormous campaigns to combat youth smoking and minimum-age requirements on items as common as cough syrup, it seems clear that those in positions of authority don't trust youth to make proper decisions.  With such widely accepted assumptions about the inadequacy of youth decision making, how can we claim moving students to a college environment where they are less supervised can possibly be a good idea?<br /><br />As we both come from backgrounds with an important emphasis on the family-unit, we agree that one of the fundamental problems with education is that the \"incentive to learn\" has largely been strewn aside.  Our experiences in college to a large degree reflect this fact.  So much time and money is spent on student activities that it is perhaps to the actual detriment of education.  This is why the phrase \"High School 2\" is increasingly associated with undergraduate studies and we are increasingly told that we will need a master's degree to gain the former equivalent of a BA.<br /><br />In short, we feel that the primary purpose of reform ought to be to fix the fundamental problems associated with the education system and that reinstituting the emphasis on \"incentives to learn\" and the \"importance of education\" must come about by revitalizing these dogmatic phrases into once again meaningful ideals.", "recommendationCount": 18}, {"assetID": 1174520, "replies": [], "lft": 556, "assetURL": "http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/feeling-guilty-about-your-purebred-dog/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1587832, "rgt": 557, "userDisplayName": "Laura A", "createDate": "1266555502", "userID": 60089914, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266556668", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266556668", "commentSequence": 273, "commentBody": "As a breeder of purebred Siberian Huskies, as well as the owner of several rescues and pound dogs, where people get their dogs isn't as important as doing the research on the breed and knowing what they're getting themselves into.

Lysacek will always be known now as the Olympic gold medalist who couldn't do a quad.

We should celebrate the unique and courageous talents of athletes like Johnny Weir. His life is one of self-creation and he sets an example for all of us who despise conformity as a means to get ahead.  I hope he does not become discouraged by this injustice.  My heart breaks for him.  As for the NBC anchors, shame on them for not calling those unfair judges out.  They are not anchors, but instead cheer leaders for Lysacek and Pluschenko, and co-dependent enablers of those disgusting judges.

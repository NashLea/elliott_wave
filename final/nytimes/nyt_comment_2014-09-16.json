They whined about the prisoner swap for Bergdahl and called for an \"investigation.\"  The only time I can recall Americans negotiating with terrorists was when Reagan cut a deal with the Iranian that were holding American hostages before the election in 1980 to insure that the hostages wouldn't be released until after the election, in effect getting in the way of the Carter Administrations efforts to have the hostages freed.  Ronnie worried that a release of the hostages before the election might lead to a Carter victory in the election.  Reagan also subsequently negotiated with Iranian terrorists, illegally selling eight shipments of arms to Iran for cash and the hope that hostages would be released.  The first two shipments went through Israel.  Although it didn't free too many hostages, it did give the Reagan administration money to send arms to the Contras in Nicaragua, who probably also qualified as terrorists by most definitions.  Congress had passed the Boland Amendment, which expressly prohibited sending arms to the Contras.

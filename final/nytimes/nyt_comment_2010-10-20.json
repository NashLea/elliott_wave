Alan Grayson of Florida finally gets it right.<br /><br />Grayson, whom we criticized for twisting the words of his opponent in a TV ad called \"Taliban Dan,\" released a new ad Oct. 6 called \"The Facts\" and invited the media to review it. We did.<br /><br /> This time he mostly sticks to the facts and doesn\u2019t resort to doctored evidence.<br /><br />The narrator \u2014 a woman \u2014 lays out what she says are facts about Republican candidate Daniel Webster\u2019s record regarding women. We\u2019ll take the main points in order.<br /><br />\u2018Covenant\u2019 Marriage?<br /><br />The ad says, \"Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in an abusive relationship.\" This is true, although he sponsored it two decades ago, and it didn\u2019t pass.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />So:<br /><br />Most importantly, Grayson, according to factcheck, is a liar and did present doctored evidence on more than one occasion.  On his third try, he did present, shall we say, severely edited evidence that his opponent submitted a bill [NOTE: 20 years ago, that didn't pass]  that would have provided [NOTE: as a voluntary option] for a form of marriage in which adultery was the sole ground for divorce, so that a woman [NOTE: or man] in an abusive relationship could not get a divorce on those grounds  [NOTE: though I assume laws against battery would continue to exist--the whole thing is moot anyway].<br /><br />There's a good deal more on the same order as this, but who cares?<br /><br />Next--you ask me about Anderson Cooper.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that.  I didn't cite Cooper, I didn't hear him, I have no idea what he said, I don't know how he got into this discussion and I have no position about him whatever.  NOTE: I'm assuming Anderson Cooper is male as I write this, but I don't even know that.<br /><br />Back to Grayson:  he claims (under the withering interrogation of Ed Schultz) that 20 percent of all outside money in this election is directed against him.  Really.  There are 37 Senate contests, about the same number of governorships and 435 House contests, and 20 percent of the money is aimed at Alan?

I remember his slashing state jobs and privatising them for, he said, a fraction of the cost, but it didn't turn out that way.  He called his slash and burn program \"People First\", though it appeared to some that it was really no more than an excuse to replace decently paid and well trained state employees with poorly trained private employees making a fraction of the amount as their predecessors.  I remember the identity theft that occurred under his watch as the new private and poorly paid/poorly educated people (who took the now privatised state jobs), stole information about state employees in order to commit identity theft.  I also remember when he tried to shut down the state library, in order to shift the academic collections all over the state, that a ring of librarians locked hands around the state library to prevent this from happening.  These librarians actually amounted to one of his few defeats.  He may be \"more moderate\" than his brother, but I doubt his principals have changed much, i.e.,drastically slash government spending (meaning jobs -- people) so as to privatise and poorly pay as many as possible.

Rather, it is completely explained by two factors having nothing to do with anti-white bias: namely, the general differences in rates of criminal offending, and the rates at which whites and blacks encounter one another (and thus, have the opportunity to victimize one another). Once these two factors are \u201ccontrolled for\u201d in social science terms, the actual rates of black-on-white crime are lower than random chance would predict;<br/>* No more than 0.7 percent (seven-tenths of one percent) of African Americans will commit a violent crime against a white person in a given year, and fewer than 0.3 (three-tenths of one percent) of whites will be victimized by a black person in a given year;\"<br/><br/>Read the rest at:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/08/race-crime-and-statistical-malpractice-how-the-right-manipulates-white-fear-with-bogus-data/\" title=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/08/race-crime-and-statistical-malpractice-how-the-right-manipulates-white-fear-with-bogus-data/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.timwise.org/2013/08/race-crime-and-statistical-malpractice-ho...</a>"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 13582244, "replies": [], "commentID": 13584891, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "William Case", "createDate": "1418567338", "userID": 60790181, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1418570339", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 12, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "William Case", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Texas", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1418570339", "commentSequence": 13584891, "commentBody": "I agree that both interracial murders and police homicides are rare.

The \"victims\" are usually armed and often die in an exchange of gunfire. But the assertion is that whites and especially white police target black males. This is why tens of thousands of protestors are marching. However, the claim that whites are waging a \"war against black males\" is absurd. The reality is that Africans Americans are much likely to kill whites than whites are to kill blacks.  It's not just a matter of percentages.

Blacks make up only 13 percent of the population, but the racial disparity in police shootings is consistent with the racial disparity in violent crime rates. For example, the racial disparity in fatal police encounters. The FBI Uniform Crime Report show that blacks killed 51.2 percent of the 78 police officers murdered during 2013. (Forty of the cop killers were black, 30 were white (including Hispanics), and 2 were Asian/Pacific Islander. Race was not reported for 2 offenders.) White cops made up 88.5 percent of the murdered officers.  <br/><br/>White parents also have \"the talk\" with their children about not venturing into black neighborhoods. Blacks are quicker than whites on the interracial trigger finger. The racial disparity in interracial murders that don\u2019t involve cops is greater than the disparity in fatal police shooting. The FBI Uniform Crime Report (Expanded Homicide Data Table 6) shows that 409 blacks killed whites while 189 whites (including Hispanics) killed blacks in 2013.

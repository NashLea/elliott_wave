It is the most visited site in town and often during the hot summer months the crowds are massive.  During high season the optimum time to begin the 2 kilometer walk is as soon as they open for the day, at 0800.  Early morning is preferable rather than later in the day because the blistering heat has baked the aged stones much like a brick oven.  It can be warm already at 0900 but by 1100  or 1400 it is so much worse.<br/>\nThe easiest entry is Sveti Ivan, adjacent to the Maritime Museum.  You should visit the museum, either before you climb up to the wall or at the end if you walk the entire circuit.   The museum provides a historical perspective of Dubrovnik\u2019s nautical prowess that surpassed the Venetians.   Don\u2019t miss the small botanical garden created and maintained by one of the local residents.  There is also a faux guillotine and you might want to put your head in for a photo op.<br/>\nBy beginning at Sveti Ivan, the first view is the old harbor where many local fishing and pleasure boats are moored.  You can see a building with the 3 arches which is now a restaurant and during much earlier times was where wooden vessels were maintained.  This half of the wall is the most strenuous with many sets of steps, both up and down, while gradually climbing to the highest point on the wall, Minceta Tower. You will find the views of the bell tower, the Dominican Monastery, Revelin Fort and an area of town which is named \u201cZlatni Potok\u201d (Golden River).  I think that it should be named the Golden Mile, a very exclusive area.  The furthest point was the Belvedere Hotel, once the best located property in Dubrovnik, which was totally destroyed during the shelling of town during the 1991 Homeland War.<br/>\nMinceta Tower is just a few more meters, the highest point on the wall, and the views are fantastic.  On the right hand side is the Pile Brsalj and the magnificent Grand Imperial Hotel, which is now managed by Hilton.  Built in 1897, the hotel was destroyed during the war and was rebuilt to exactly the same specifications of the original building.  The interior is now modern and it\u2019s the perfect location for those who wish to be within a few steps to the Vrata od Pile (Door of Pile) entrance to the old town.<br/><br/>The main entrance is often mistakenly called Pile by guests, however it is the Spas Entrance, named for the small church Sveti Spas (Saint Savior) located at the base inside the wall.  One of three buildings which survived the 1667 earthquake, it is now a location for musical concerts during the evening hours.<br/>\nThe sea side of the wall has always been the easiest to walk.  There are some steps and a bit of climbing, but not too demanding.  Walking along the turquoise blue Adriatic on the right, the old town glistens with its red hued tiles under the golden sunshine.  Just below on the rocky ledge are the two Buza Bars just a few meters above the sea where tourists flock every evening to watch phenomenal sunsets. On the left is the Sveti Marija the oldest part of town which was an island many years before the Stradun was filled in and the island of Laus and the town of Ragusa became Dubrovnik.<br/>\nLast fall I walked the wall three consecutive days to explain to guests what they were seeing, after which I recuperated for about a week.  It saddens me to see how many guests walk the wall without a guide and I often see many photos with captions of \u201ccity walls.\u201d  Dubrovnik ramparts is not just a walk on the wall, it\u2019s a learning experience.

When I entered teaching, I was told that if a child fails, it is my fault. I found that statement unbelievable. Coming from the business world, I could understand that it was my \"fault\" if I let schedules slide and didn't communicate issues and status. As a teacher, I can only control what happens in my classroom. I cannot control whether or not a student studies for a test, does their homework, or comes to me when needing assistance. I can just show them that I care and will be there if they need me. 45 minutes of class time is not enough for me to teach what I am being told, and give your child time to do their homework and other projects that I require. There must be some responsibility at home. I believe the school districts must require that parents be involved in their schools and their children's school lives. <br/><br/>My son has attended public and charter schools. In order for your child to attend the charter schools, parents must commit to 40 hours a year in volunteer hours, as well as sign a homework agreement. Just imagine the difference this would make in our public schools if every parent volunteered 40 hours! It demonstrates to your child you are committed to their education and their school. There are so many avenues that the volunteer time can take. I've had parents who work full-time make folders &amp; files, or parents who travel take care of sending emails and communications to other parents and make flyers/signs. Regardless, the possibilities are endless when you stop making excuses. (Just an FYI: When my son was at the public school, my husband and I both volunteered without having to sign a commitment form).<br/><br/>In regards to the comment about trying to teach children responsibility, teachers and administrators are all for teaching children to be responsible for themselves. I can remember a time when my son just didn't want to get up and get to school on time. I called the principal to give him a heads up that he might end up at school in his pajamas. One time was all it took. :) The important thing for every parent to remember is good communication with their children's teachers is the utmost importance. Teachers are not mind readers. If you don't communicate the issues going on with your family, your child, etc, we can't help support you or your child to the best of our ability. Teachers must also remember to do their best in keeping the communication lines open. With so many options for communication these days, there just are no excuses.<br/><br/>Charter schools are created because parents are fed up with not being heard by their neighborhood schools, and district administers, school board members are too worried about \"stepping on toes\" politically. These parents are committed to a better education and school environment for their children. They tirelessly take on fundraisers throughout the year to raise money for the schools, since most are only partially funded through the district. If district administrators and school boards were applying best practices to their school's curriculum, there would be no need for charter schools. The tireless efforts of parents would go towards the neighborhood schools in making them better.<br/><br/>Education for our children does not stop when the school day stops. Parents must also model responsible behavior and set high expectations for their children and send the message that school is important. When all parents step up to the plate, devote more time to their children's school, teach and model respect for their children's teachers, then I believe things will change. <br/><br/>I am glad to see this article in the Times. I, too, am fed up with politicians and administrators wanting to blame the teachers. I dare anyone to walk one day in my shoes, then see the pay you get for your average 10-12 hour day. Most of us teach because we want to make a difference and we believe that every child has a right to a good education. Our children are our future. A good teacher's job is never done. Don't believe for a minute just because we have the summer \"off\", we are not working. We are always looking for new ways to introduce material that will enable your child to retain knowledge. I spend my summers planning and documenting lesson plans, researching new ideas and trends in math, as well as tutoring. <br/><br/>Thank you, Lisa Belkin, for this article. If nothing else, I hope it makes people think about what could happen if parents, communities, administrators, school boards, and politicians continue to not support our children and their future. It would be a shame if the situation gets this far. For many students, school is the only place where they feel safe and nurtured. These people need to stop pointing fingers, stop making excuses, and advocate for change based on best-practices, rather than $$. Only then can a paradigm shift occur that will make a difference.

It's mean old ignorant, racist whitey strikes again. This country doesn't have a racism problem, this country has a white problem. This seems to be the bottom line to any discussion of race on this blog. <br/><br/>Does Mr. Taylor face similar hostility because of his race on a regular basis? Is this incident indicative of a larger problem, or was it a relatively isolated incident? I was intrigued when I read the title of this post, hoping to gain some insightful commentary on the changing demographics of this country, especially on the playground, but I get a story about one clearly crazy woman, and a consensus that yep, that's what white people do. The average white is just seething with hate for non-whites, especially black men. What has Mr. Taylor's general experience on the playground been as a black father in a (I assume) majority white area? What were the reactions of other parents on the playground when this woman had her outburst? I think these are very important points of the story that were left out.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'll be accused of being a white woman who is trying to make this story about her, but I'd appreciate some of you to consider this: I do not think it is a stretch to assume that the majority of the readers of this blog are white, upper middle class, educated individuals who live in majority white neighborhoods. Racial strife and tensions are something you read about, not experience on a daily basis. Above I spoke of the changing demographics of this country, especially on the playgrounds. I live in a majority non-white neighborhood. I have been subjected to similar behavior as Mr. Taylor because of my race. I have been subject to institutionalized discrimination because of my race. So has my white husband. As this country because more and more multiracial and multicultural, the discussion on race needs to keep up, and consider all perspectives, not just what white people are doing to non-whites. I find it highly offensive when some rich white person in a white neighborhood tells me that I have never experienced racism, while spouting off some archaic analysis of race in this country, and that I need to sit down and listen to experiences like Mr. Taylor's so I can learn from them.

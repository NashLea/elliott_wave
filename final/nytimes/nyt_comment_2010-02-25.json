He was a strong, physical goal-line and short yardage runner.<br /><br />Tatupu will probably be best remembered as an outstanding special teams player, one of the best of his era.<br /><br />He particularly excelled on the kickoff coverage team. Here, coaches are looking for aggressive players who are big enough to take on double-teams and wedge blocks and fast enough to chase if the return is away. They must attack potential blockers and create collisions. They had better be sound tacklers and, most importantly, they must have the intense desire to be part of a successful unit. Mosi Tatupu possessed all these necessary qualities.<br /><br />That kickoff coverage team played a vital role in New England's Super Bowl run in 1985. In the wild card game against the Jets, Johnny Rembert's 15 yard return of a fumbled kickoff broke the game open in the third quarter in a 26-14 win.<br /><br />In the divisional playoff against the Raiders, the Patriots tied the game in the third quarter, 20-20, on a 32 yard field goal by Tony Franklin. On the ensuing kickoff Sam Seale fielded the ball on the nine yard line, fumbled it, picked it up, but fumbled again after Tatupu nailed him. The ball rolled into the end zone where it was covered by Jim Bowman for the touchdown that proved to be the winning margin.<br /><br />The following week, in the A.F.C. Championship game against the Dolphins, Tatupu did it again. His hit on Lorenzo Hampton forced a fumble on the second half kickoff. The Patriots recovered on the Miami 25 and scored six plays later to extend their lead to 24-7 in an eventual 31-14 victory.<br /><br />Mosi Tatupu played football with passion. He gave it everything he had on every play, in every role, with infectious enthusiasm, and without complaint.

We want to live in a non-corrupt society?  If we tax Mr. Woods' wealth prohibitively, maybe then he couldn't become \"corrupt\".

The goodness of fidelity marriage and monogamy are your beliefs, and you should not generalize your beliefs to the rest of us.<br />3) what are YOUR fantasies?  If you had Mr. Woods' wealth and fame, what would want to do?<br />4) what are YOUR current addictions, assuming that you currently lack Mr. Woods' wealth and fame?  alcohol? nicotine? methamphetamines? work? money? food? caffeine? amphetamines? gambling?  i am not sure that Mr. Woods has an exceptionally news-worthy or notable addiction.  i would rather be addicted to sex than some other things.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1198392, "replies": [], "lft": 94, "assetURL": "http://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/is-sex-addiction-an-excuse/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1617684, "rgt": 95, "userDisplayName": "merseymain", "createDate": "1267075787", "userID": 59899019, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267076356", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Liverpool, ENGLAND", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267076356", "commentSequence": 47, "commentBody": "here in England there are sportsman who are being found out to be cheating quite often.

If the Saudi.s are bombing transportation centers for military equipment or cargo ships with military equipment, then they will kill civilians who are engaged in helping their foes fight a war. In modern warfare, nations try to destroy the ability of their foes to make war, and that includes all people who help their foes wage war, whether they are military personnel or not.

I often buy and sell cars: the hangup with private party sales in another region is getting the car checked out before purchase, and shipping.  It is on the seller to get it to a dealer for an inspection, and then has to help arrange shipping.  Often, the buyer will fly to see the car and bring it home, which is tough for those of us with regular jobs and kids to care for; driving a car from Chicago to Oregon on short notice could pose a challenge.  There is the wire transfer that happens without product in hand.  But for many of us (say enthusiasts who want hard to find manual transmissions, for example), it is the only reasonable way to find what we want.  The car simply may not be available locally; if it is, it is often priced at a premium. I would gladly pay a service $1000 plus shipping to take care of these details: it will still be well below the typical $5,000 dealer margin on a $35,000 used car. <br/><br/>This may not be the best program for a potential buyer who doesn't really know what they want.  Especially if return shipping at some point is no longer subsidized.  But for those of us who are looking for a specific car and know exactly what we need; it could gain traction in the marketplace.<br/><br/>As far as shady dealers go; when buying used, stick to reputable luxury dealers.  They sell all makes and models, but service at, say a Lexus dealer, far surpasses the Jeep dealer example mentioned. .

Throw in the expected low cost of maintenance (due to Toyota's reliability) and you get a quite affordable car, assuming one can make payments.

The Lexus would be $9k less to own over those 4 years: not to mention the very significant bonus of driving an IS350 (probably the best sport sedan on the road today, sorry BMW) vs. a run of the mill Ford.

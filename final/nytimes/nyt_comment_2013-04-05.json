By-and-large, I agree with evidence-based health care as a key approach to improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of care, and ultimately improving the health of patients and the population.

This is relative. For drugs, a \"gold standard\" of experimental &amp; control studies is always (or almost always) correct. For many other medical practices the bar should probably also be high, but might vary, for example, if it will take too long or economically infeasible to do controlled studies. As practices move more to the social side of health, e,g., nurse assistance for poor mothers with infants or helping people maintain healthy behaviors, the bar should be lower to enable promising practices (again, with SOME demonstrated success) to be used, funded, and benefit more people sooner.

We are a foster family for Lab Rescue, and because so many dogs come through our organization, we have an alphabetical rotation like the weather service uses for hurricanes each year.  It keeps things straight at the vet and on our website, but clearly most of those dogs need to be renamed as soon as they are adopted by their forever families.  I am amused when some families are reluctant to change their names for fear of confusing them.  The dogs are typically adopted in just ten days to two weeks, and we usually have no idea what names they used in their past.  Pick a name you like to say, that makes you smile, and gets you a wagging tail.  That is the best one that works!", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3365862, "replies": [], "lft": 495, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/garden/the-art-of-naming-a-dog.html", "parentID": 8690985, "commentID": 8691547, "rgt": 496, "userDisplayName": "me not frugal", "createDate": "1365104323", "userID": 49716641, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1365134672", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1365131072", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I disagree.

By executive order, the President is enacting legislation that he and his allies cannot jam through Congress.

First, it is likely to polarize, if not enrage, opponents and also draw in potential supporters who are concerned about the Constitutional ramifications of the President's actions.  Second, it means that immigration, which is a third rail of American politics, is likely to become a focus of the fall campaign.

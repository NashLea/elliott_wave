This needs to occur in context with transparent cost and outcome data visible to patients and disintermediated payors.

It aims directly at loss control payment policy and high-consequence risk mitigation.

Rising healthcare costs are one of the largest reasons why unemployment is stuck near 10%. Most people don't realize that benefits represent 30-40% of employee costs (the other 60-70% is salary/wages). With employer healthcare costs rising at +10% annually, it's no wonder that employers are holding back from adding full time employees to their payroll. Further the increasing healthcare entitlement liability for our country is a threat to our economy and standard of living. It's popular to blame doctors, insurance companies and employers for the healthcare crisis, as it deflects personal responsibility.  The truth is we, as Americans, are poor consumers of healthcare.  As a result we use the healthcare system too often, for the wrong reasons, with the majority of resources spent to fix problems that could be prevented. It's unfortunate that we need to incentivize (sorry language police) ourselves to take care of themselves, however that's the reality we face. Just as seatbelt, helmet, and speed limit laws have saved many lives, healthcare incentives could be one step toward saving our healthcare system and economy.  Plus it would have the added benefit of people feeling better and being more productive.  There is a separate article in today's NY Times about the first Baby Boomers turning 65 today. This is a great reminder of the need for real improvements to healthcare, not blame and taxation.

I don't think that banks are doing enough to help their customers when traveling abroad.<br /><br />I had similar problems with Bank of America when they cancelled by card due to what they deemed \"suspicious activity\" - that is, the fact that the card was being used on non-U.S. territory. I tried calling collect from a pay phone - via an operator - and it didn't work. The operator told me that the number wasn't being recognized. This was in France, and then later in Italy. I ended up going to an internet cafe and calling the bank on Skype from a pre-paid U.S. Skype number. The frustrating process of repeatedly being put on hold and given contradictory information and instructions usually lasted up to one hour, but I only paid at most 2 euros (for the internet connection). The bank said they would reimburse me for the costs but by then I was sick of engaging with bank representatives (I had to explain my situations about a dozen times in one phone call) so I decided against initiating the procedure to get any money back. It wasn't too much anyway.<br /><br />The point is that banks should do more to help you out when traveling abroad. Just because the collect numbers are \"supposed\" to work when processed via operators doesn't mean they do. They often don't. There are many reasons for this, but the bottom line is that banks should be aware of this and try to fix the problem. It wouldn't be that terrible if they didn't have you on hold for half an hour and then offer up what often feels like incompetent customer service (or incompetently trained).<br /><br />I hope they shape up, and perhaps more blog postings and articles like these will help get that done. Thanks.

First, similar to the United States Constitution, you cannot (or should not) look in total to the founding fathers or in this case founding Father for uncontested guidance. The Father in question might even be retired or dead. Therefore, Jesus, today, probably could not (or should not) rely upon a traditional, personal God to direct his way. Moreover, I don't think Buddha's way fills the quest--too much personal, possibly self-interest, in the search for individual \"unconditional happiness.\" Having faith/belief in science, beyond the material world, doesn't accomplish much either so I don't suggest that direction for him. Possibly he might step into the uncertainty--more accurately the confusion of philosophical reasoning but beware of false ideas. There's the \"golden rule\" which I strongly recommend. Further, I saw a quote by literary critic Harold Bloom offering much wisdom. He said: \" Only dualism, the distinction between Ideal forms and ordinary realities, is truth for Plato's Socrates.\" In short, maybe one has to return to the spoken words of each Jesus and Socrates for help and direction.

Millions of people are treated successfully (and appropriately) with opioids and do not become drug addicts.

Take away the stigma of \"addiction\", and let the physicians treat the pain appropriately with the medication required; educate the patient that there will likely be a \"dependency\", but this is not addiction. Dependency can be easily managed medically by weaning off of the substance, but I think this part is all too often ignored because docs are constantly in fear of DEA so at the first hint of \"addiction\" (which usually is dependency instead), the docs tend to cut off the prescription suddenly.

Of course. The Eagles in Philly? Should, but a healthy Vick might change that. Giants? Well, it will be a Jets crowd, sort of, but still a tough draw. Dolphins?

One stumble anywhere along the way likely ends the chase.<br/><br/>Do the Jets have the natural ability to be that better team? They do. Do they have the coaching talent to bring that out? I believe they do, but that's not a given. The coaching staff does need to change how they do things, because the way they've done things so far has led them here, to a team which too often adds an unnecessary difficulty factor.

Last month Blue Cross of Michigan acknowledged that two-thirds of hysterectomies are unnecessary.  The cost to these women and their families is enormous in health and lost quality of life. <br/><br/>Nora W.

Resident and fellow back in the Q3 up all night call era.  Now often still working 80 to 100 clinical hours a week, at least 6 in hospital overnight calls a month.  Still paying off med school loans.  Making the same salary I was making as a general pediatrician over 10 years ago.  Usually 4 weekend days off per month, sometimes less.<br/><br/>I agree completely with limiting the number of hours any human being is expected to remain awake and working.  One cannot absorb new information or perform complex intellectual or manual skills when one is nauseated, bleary eyed, and increasingly disconnected after lack of sleep for more than 24 to 36 hours.  Yep, I ended up in a corn field driving home as a resident too.  We all have those stories.<br/><br/>And yet, to answer a question from a previous reader, attending physicians are now taking over the clinical activities that residents used to perform.  Resident has to leave for conference, or take a mandated nap, or leave at the end of a shift with no new resident to replace them?  \"Their\" patients have been and still are my responsibility.  As an attending physician, I always stay in house on call now, something my supervising attendings never did 15 years ago.  Many physicians coming out of residency do not have the same basic procedural skills that we did 15 years ago - so my colleagues and I end up doing those procedures for them.  More and more often, we hear comments from residents and medical students similar to those made by the second year med student above - they want to find jobs with minimal or no call, so they can spend time at home with their families.  That's fantastic for them - but then, who will care for their patients at night or on school holidays or at other inconvenient times?<br/><br/>I used to love being a doctor.  Sleep deprivation, loss of ties with family and friends because I'm always working, loss of outside interests because I can't balance them with my work load and CME hours and administrative responsibilities, and lack of basic human decency from the parents of the children with whom I interact have really eaten away at my initial desire to help children and their families through times of illness.  In the last 3 years, I've had a handgun pulled on me in the middle of the ICU, been screamed at by more parents than I can count, been pulled away from and accused of hurting a child who was in shock by his parents as I was trying to start an IV, had a grandparent grab my arm as I was trying to place a central line,  watched a colleague get punched and shoved to the floor by a parent, had to call security for protection for a child whose parents were throwing things at each other over her ICU bed, and on and on...<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, we all have to look at ourselves more closely.  Physicians in training need to understand that this is not a profession where one should expect immense financial rewards or a 9-to-5 schedule.  You really need to LOVE helping people to be here, and that should be reflected in everything you do.  Plus, you have to seek out learning opportunities so you are competently trained by the end of residency.  However, medical professionals should expect to recoup our significant financial outlays for school and earn a salary which covers the increasing multiple thousands of dollars of licensing and professional fees for which we are responsible.  And, especially if we are to be expected to earn what the public deems is a \"reasonable\" salary (and, yes, my colleagues and I take home less than $130K a year for working 100+ hours a week), then our total number of hours worked must decrease accordingly.  Parents and families should expect a physician who listens to them, spends time with them, and who genuinely seems to care what is happening to them and their child/loved one.  However, they should also understand that most physicians and other health care professionals are NOT out to deliberately hurt them or to steal from them.  There are exceptions in every profession, and such physicians should be dealt with harshly.  But, when I'm in a child's room with a nurse and an RT at 2 AM, it's not because of the exorbitant salary any of us are making.  We're there because we care and want to help their child get better.  And, while grief can be overwhelming, it does not provide an acceptable excuse for physical or verbal violence to nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, housekeepers, physicians, ex wives or husbands, or anyone else helping to provide your loved one's care.<br/><br/>A well rested doctor may be a better doctor.  An engaged, empathetic, competently trained, adequately reimbursed, AND well rested doctor, providing care to patients/families who they have and take time to listen to, learn from, care for, earn respect and trust from, take some degree of responsibility for, and can expect not to be physically harmed by, is certainly a better doctor.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2602456, "replies": [], "lft": 166, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/the-truth-about-sex-and-exercise/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3669093, "rgt": 167, "userDisplayName": "Jerome", "createDate": "1302483533", "userID": 29496093, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302495541", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Virginia", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302491941", "commentSequence": 76, "commentBody": "Regular exercise increases fitness, blood flow, and alertness.

It has puzzled pcps and other medical experts over the last three years.

My hands continue to ache for hours each day with stinging cold all across the knuckles and over the fingers of both hands. Heated gloves help but the cold sensation returns as soon as I take them off. A rheumatologist said I did not display the classic red/blue/white signs of Raynaud's.

That is nonsense. What we have is an unemployment crisis and a crisis of falling demand and revenue. Romer is right. The president is not trying hard enough to create more jobs and restart the economy. His emphasis on deficit-cutting is a disaster, since it allows the Republicans to set the terms of the whole debate about the recession and jobs. \r<br/><br/>In terms of economics, budget-cutting during a recession almost guarantees that unemployment will go up and that demand will become weaker. If the Dems give in to the Repubs and agree to big budget cuts, we might even have a double-dip recession, pushing the recovery off even further into the future. Cutting the budget during a recession is economic madness. It ruined the economy in 1937 when FDR tried it; it ruined the Japanese economy in 1997 when they tried it; and it is now hurting the British economy because the conservatives slashed the budget. Cutting the budget during a recession is the perfect recipe for hurting the economy, increasing unemployment, causing lower revenues, and therefore *increasing* the deficit. And since the financial reform bill was mostly window dressing, there will doubtless be another big recession coming up in five years or so. We will enter the era of permanent recession for the foreseeable future.\r<br/><br/>If Obama joins the Repubs in calling for big budget cuts instead of a new economic stimulus bill and robust job-creation measures, he doesn't deserve to be the Dem candidate in 2012. He should make up his mind. If he wants to cut the budget and increase unemployment and thus raise the deficit, he should step down and run as an independent or a Republican in 2012. It's time for Obama to listen to Romer and to the majority of Americans and start fighting hard for more jobs and for economic recovery.

At that point in Reagan's presidency, according to the bureau of labor statistics, unemployment was 10.2% for May 1983.  In fact, under RR, unemployment was over 10% for 10 months straight from September 1982 to June 1983 compared to Obama's one month, and over 9% for 19 months.  It was 7.5% when he won the election and took office which is lower than what Obama inherited.<br/><br/>As for critics of Obama's stimulus policies as being socialist spending (#6 Dale), I'd like to \"remind\" them that about $250 billion was in tax cuts.  I'd also like to \"remind\" them that Reagan also enacted a very Keynesian policy on 2 counts: lower taxes during the recession/recovery and a dramatic increase in spending, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce dept.  In Keynesian fashion, he also raised taxes, albeit quietly, after the recovery was well under way, not that he understood any of this, of course.<br/><br/>The main differences: a) the dems played nice in the early 1980s compared to the absolute non-cooperation of current republicans, and b) what Obama inherited - housing and financial crises, 2 unfunded wars and other increased spending despite cuts in taxes, and the resulting already exploding deficits - was much worse than what Reagan inherited.  It is the non-cooperative republicans and blue-dogs who are the ones responsible for this continuing misery, and both dems and republicans and voters for creating the situation over the years, but, critics on the right will never see that, either out of vested interest (choice) or willful ignorance and laziness about checking facts.", "recommendationCount": 292}, {"assetID": 2800546, "replies": [], "lft": 120, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/business/economy/02jobs.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3924978, "rgt": 121, "userDisplayName": "FR", "createDate": "1306987388", "userID": 3942671, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1306987797", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1306984197", "commentSequence": 44, "commentBody": "When access to cr4edit expands teh economy will heal.

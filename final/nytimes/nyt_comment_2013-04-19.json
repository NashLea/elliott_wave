It doesn't become invalid because you don't like it. <br/><br/>from her article above:<br/>... scientific articles on the mechanism of levonorgestrel, the synthetic hormone that is the drug\u2019s active ingredient, demonstrates that Plan B is not about abortion. It immobilizes sperm and prevents or delays ovulation. In other words, when taken shortly after unprotected intercourse, Plan B works as birth control, by preventing rather than terminating a pregnancy. (The F.D.A.-approved label for Plan B raises the possibility that the drug might also work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus to begin a pregnancy, but the National Institutes of Health has removed language raising this prospect from its Web site, and the N.I.H. biochemist in charge of research on contraception has said the language should also be taken off the label. Judge Korman called the prospect that Plan B might permit fertilization but prevent implantation \u201cscientifically unsupported speculation.\u201d)<br/><br/>As for your definition of a pregnancy, you claim implantation is a legal definition, not a scientific one. As someone who works in healthcare, that's certainly not the medical consensus. You can define it however you want, but you can't base legal and policy decisions on your personal definition.<br/><br/>And what is the constitutional protection that is being violated by allowing direct access to safe contraception?

So long as the Party of No says no to efforts to expanding employment -- with more stimulus -- and says no to increasing spending -- by, for instance, refusing to extend unemployment benefits -- business has no reason to grow because too few Americans can afford to buy. It's downright ironic that the Chamber of Commerce is aiding &amp; abetting the anti-business contingent.<br /><br />Furthermore, the anti-business Washington cabal constricts the market by creating uncertainty.

I loved the days when HP manufactured everything from the aluminum chassis and PC boards to assembling the final product.   Engineers then worked side by side with technicians and machinists getting work done  Unfortunately, I was also around to watch HP largely abandon manufacturing in favor of becoming a design house and services provider with a rock star CEO.

Unfortunately this tactic works with the Obama administration. Considering how quickly Obama has conceded ground on the political battles in which it has engaged (Afghanistan, Iraq, health care and financial \u201creform\u201d), it appears that his administration is either too easily intimidated by criticism from the entrenched DC establishment or the administration never had any intention of making the bold (and politically popular) changes it campaigned on.<br /><br />Small businesses and entrepreneurs do have reasons to complain in this economic environment. For starters, the unwillingness of banks to lend money has dried up an important source of investment capital. Policies of the Federal Reserve have more to do with this circumstance than the Obama administration. The largest US banks prefer to borrow money from the Fed at zero percent interest and simultaneously hold that money at the Fed while receiving interest. This is a no-brainer for the banks which are trying to bolster their capital reserves and improve their shaky balance sheets. But this has the effect of diminishing available capital for smaller banks that are vital to small businesses.<br /><br />The trend for large well-capitalized corporations however appears to be self-financing. The largest corporations are awash in available capital so many are turning away from traditional lending practices, i.e. getting loans from large commercial banks, and working out financing from within. This is yet another way large corporate businesses have an advantage over small businesses and entrepreneurs.<br /><br />In order to improve circumstances for small businesses that are the real engine for economic growth and employment, the Obama administration and Congress should develop policies that improve the standing of small businesses while simultaneously reconsidering and dismantling policies that favor giant corporations. Changing tax policy is just one way to do this. Large corporate interests have been influencing tax policies for decades and not surprisingly have done rather well for themselves. Taking what is essentially a populist stance on tax policies for large corporations and the myriad forms of corporate welfare would be both politically beneficial to the administration and his party, AND improve the long term economic viability of the nation.

The Internet certainly weakens the \"agenda-setting function\" of the mass media.  Not only does it afford us free and immediate access to information, it gives us a medium through which we may discuss and debate the significance of the information received with one another.

There are some texts -- mostly novels -- I wouldn't read on the Internet. But these are not books I read for information or even really for ideas; they're books I read for the turn of the narrative &amp; an acquaintance with the characters. Of course novels do convey information &amp; ideas, but reading them is an experience, not a primary means of learning about Parisian landmarks or existentialism.<br /><br />But when I read to learn something new, it doesn't matter to me whether I learn it on a printed page or on the Internet. The medium is not the message.  I've read quite a few of the important works of Dead White European Males on the Internet. I didn't give the DWEMs any more or less \"deference\" because of the medium on which I accessed their works. It didn't occur to me I was \"just as good as\" Plato or Philo of Alexandria or Isaiah Berlin because their works had been reduced to bits &amp; bytes that came at me on my laptop rather than via ink on a page. The fact that I didn't have to go to the public library or look through my own bookshelves to try to find these works didn't lower (or raise) my appreciation for the works themselves. You might argue that because my computer sits in a room full of books that it is the books that line the walls that REALLY make me a reader.

There is also an eerie sense in which the Internet can feel like an extension of your own brain, like an add-on social memory that gives you access to images and sounds from your childhood that in earlier generations would have been lost forever.  (I had an old 78 rpm record 40 years ago, from which I remembered only the words \u201cHickey Hank.\u201d  In less than a minute, I found a reference to the Edison disc titled, \u201cA Submarine Attack,\u201d and was listening to it on YouTube a minute after that.  On the flip side was \u201cK-K-K-Katie.\u201d)<br /><br />But nothing is more miserable than trying to read something on a computer screen that requires concentration and focus.  Even dedicated reading devices, like the Kindle, are not there yet.  Aside from technical issues related to visibility and ergonomics, the question of just what one \u201cowns\u201d when one buys access to an e-book or e-journal is extremely troubling.  You can almost hear publishers salivating as they change the business model from selling you a book once to charging you for every word you read, every time you read it.  And ensuring permanent access to something you have purchased, as well as the ability to transfer material when upgrading the hardware, is apparently full of gotchas and outrageous restrictions.<br /><br />Reading a newspaper on the Internet is not as bad, as items are generally short and more suited to the new medium.  But even the Times, which is well laid out and full of content worth reading, can\u2019t avoid obtrusive advertising flashing in the margins, or sometimes commandeering the display to the detriment of one\u2019s peace and serenity.<br /><br />Yes, the world moves on, and it\u2019s foolish to try to stand in the way of progress.  But I get the feeling that ink on paper may have been a fortuitous invention that transcends its humble and distant origins.  There\u2019s something about reading a book that resonates with the way the brain works, which is demonstrated in the way that you remember where on the page you saw a key phrase or concept.  I\u2019m afraid young readers will grow up not knowing the pleasures and benefits of reading print, and once exposed to the seizure-inducing crack cocaine of constant, ever changing, flashy distractions on computer screens, will never be tempted to try.

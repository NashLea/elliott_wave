He has figured out (the hard way) how to minimize the stress of air travel. First, he daydreams his way through the TSA security theatre, maintaining a dreamy ovine expression while unquestioningly obeying whatever commands the screeners bellow at him. They never hassle or bother him, since they're always happy to see a cooperative passenger who acts like a sheep. Once he wedges his 6'1 frame into a coach middle seat, he immediately falls asleep and remains that way throughout the flight, except perhaps to visit the loo if the flight is long enough. <br/><br/>How he manages this preternatural feat is completely beyond my ken. Except that he has always excelled at at falling and remaining asleep. (I've once timed him, and found that he could fall asleep on demand in less than a minute.) He also has the ability to begin daydreaming the moment something becomes boring, retaining just enough attention to spring instantly alert when he's asked a question or his name is called. That may well be the indispensable skill set for surviving modern air travel, however rare it is among H. sapiens.  <br/><br/>I'll also offer my own approach, essentially the opposite of my friend's. I have no need to travel for business, so for pleasure I take only staycations. Before each day's thoroughly planned adventure, I enjoy a great night's sleep in my own bed. Then I set out by car or bus to discover and explore some fascinating places in my home town. I end the day as it began, blissfully asleep in my own bed dreaming of the next day's discoveries. Low stress on my mind and body, on my wallet, and on our beleaguered feverish planet. What could be better?<br/><br/>Obviously, neither approach is appropriate (or even desirable) for everyone.

It starts with an arrogant insistence on pretending to be infallible. Somehow it's considered an unacceptable security risk to acknowledge that the Homeland Security apparatus is capable of error. So of course they must never admit to making a mistake, and certainly must never correct a mistake once its existence has escaped the shroud of secrecy. <br/><br/>It continues with a belief that \"national security\" and the perpetual state of \"War\" makes individuals and their rights and civil liberties expendable. So if the Warriors make a mistake and put someone on a list who is ultimately cleared of suspicion, it's entirely appropriate to keep them on the list \"just to be safe.\" Whoever put them on the list clearly had a good reason for doing so, and that reason stood up to the vetting process. Even if further investigation fails to turn up specific evidence of terrorism (or any evidence at all), that still doesn't prove the person is not a threat.

Better to affirm the life sentence than to take that risk. And besides, the bureaucrat will never be held accountable to anyone for depriving a citizen of liberty without due process.

The sheer difficulty of getting oil out of water, coupled with unpredictable weather, fierce currents and thousands of miles of shoreline, make any attempt to tackle a big spill in Puget Sound uncertain at best. Despite spending tens of millions of dollars each year preparing for oil spills and cleaning them up \u2014 and despite having some of the nation's toughest oil-spill standards \u2014 some experts warn the state is not as ready for a big accident as we think we are.  \"I strongly feel we need to be better prepared,\" said Mike Cooper, chairman of the state's Oil Spill Advisory Council, a task force created to police oil-spill programs.<br />- Cooper said the state should require a big boost in spill equipment from industries \u2014 enough to suck up 70 percent of a Valdez-size spill within two days.<br />- \"I'm here to tell you, every piece of equipment in the world, if it was brought to bear, couldn't do that,\" Richard Wright said of Cooper's goal. Wright is the Northwest regional vice president of Marine Spill Response, a nonprofit funded by the oil industry to handle oil spills.<br />- \"The report would seem to indicate and support quite strongly the supposition that we are not prepared to respond to a large-scale oil spill,\" said Scott McCreery of BP [!!], who sits on the spill council. \"And I have grave concerns that that's real misleading to the public.\"<br />- A lead spill official for the Coast Guard in Seattle, Scott Knutson, said the report showed potential weaknesses that warrant closer study. He pointed to the recommendation for better equipment to track oil spills at night or in fog.  \"We have some gaps there. No doubt about it,\" he said.<br />- ... the state already requires more equipment on hand than federal standards call for ...<br />", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1411894, "replies": [], "lft": 120, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/spill-response-burn-baby-burn/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1922660, "rgt": 121, "userDisplayName": "pfhenshaw", "createDate": "1272599816", "userID": 39452637, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1272600564", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1272596964", "commentSequence": 58, "commentBody": "Well, the \"fatal error\" as usual seems to be not looking for the fatal errors, but looking only the \"fixes\" that let major risk taking get through.<br /><br />Our actual environmental plan, necessitated by our economic model relying on ever increasing control of the earth for producing short term wealth for investors, is to proceed with ever greater risk-taking till something happens, hoping we're not the ones that get caught.

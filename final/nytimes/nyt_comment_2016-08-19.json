There are good jobs to get, but many younger people today seem to want a particular job at a particular salary, and see no point to taking anything else.

Employer healthcare didn't exist in the private sector for decades, just the union jobs had that perk. Most companies didn't offer pensions to anyone except the higher ups, and only started offering health insurance to attract better employees.

Anyone from any of the representing countries can tune in and feel like they are part of the action.  The Olympics bring out the patriots in us Americans.  To see the men I routed for in the swimming pool turn out to make such poor decisions is disappointing.  If these swimmers make the Olympics in 2020 it will be hard to route for them.  This goes to show, athletes should not be idolized for athletic accomplishments.", "recommendationCount": 28}, {"assetID": 3457406, "replies": [], "lft": 4589, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/sports/olympics/police-say-ryan-lochte-lied-about-gunpoint-assault.html", "parentID": 19531258, "commentID": 19531641, "rgt": 4590, "userDisplayName": "Lorena", "createDate": "1471577883", "userID": 76437759, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1471583418", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Brazil", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1471579818", "commentSequence": 19531641, "commentBody": "It wasn't Brazilian authorities who blew this out of proportion. You expect them to go to national TV to lie about a crime, during an event like the Olympics when all the eyes are turned to that country and not get any attention? The police at first were investigating the robbery they claimed they went through. Then got to the bottom of the story. And still investigating. Grown men vandalize a gas station and go cry to the world saying they were robbed and it's the Brazilians who are the foolish babies? I don't think so.

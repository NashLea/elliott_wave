Plus they won't have to worry about their loved ones ending up destitute and homeless because they can't be employed.<br /><br />However, on the other hand, the rest of us have to struggle to afford just the insurance for our ourselves or our loved ones with mental illness.   And the insurance hardly covers the necessary treatments.    The doctors we can afford are overworked, drugs are expensive, and in-patient treatment is short term only.  As for our loved ones who can't work because of mental illness, it's difficult to get them on Social Security Disability, and even then, it pays very little, so their care often falls to those who love them (if they are lucky enough to have loved ones who can help).<br /><br />So forgive me if I don't want to read a story about the \"stress\" of being wealthy AND mentally ill.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 59}, {"assetID": 1740285, "replies": [], "lft": 186, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/when-mom-is-mistaken-for-the-nanny/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2389299, "rgt": 187, "userDisplayName": "Golf Widow", "createDate": "1281585611", "userID": 15082711, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281586396", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Minnesota", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281582796", "commentSequence": 93, "commentBody": "I've only read a few of the comments so this may be redundant in some way.

It's an innocent question that opens up the conversation about the child.  I am totally secure in my position as my kids' mom so it honestly does not faze me nor strike me as odd when someone says, \"Is he/she your child?\"  I don't assume they are asking for any reason other than to say:  \"She dropped her dinosaur by the slide\" or \"He seems to be having trouble with his shoes.\"<br /><br />I am lucky to live in an urban area that is home to many, many multiracial unions and also has a very high rate of international and interracial adoptions.  I see more families in which the kids don't clearly resemble the parents than the other way around.  I think a lot of us are used to not being able to pin a child on a given family tree based on appearances.<br /><br />Perhaps most of my comfort results from my being a 40-something biracial woman.  I was a biracial child living in a white universe long before it was anywhere near common.  I had people gawk at my dad (is he abducting her?)  Stare at my mom (is she the babysitter?)  I had classmates say I must be adopted because two people from different races cannot make babies together.  On and on.   The only time I remember being bothered was in ninth grade when Becky raised her hand and asked our social studies teacher if I was lying about the fact that I was my parents' bio daughter.  That wasn't so bad.  What was so bad was my social studies teacher (who knew both my parents really well) couldn't handle the question and changed the subject, put Becky in detention and added to my mystique, which kindled the gossip fires all over school.<br /><br />Don't overthink this stuff.", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 1736892, "replies": [], "lft": 112, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/jobs-for-kids/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2389315, "rgt": 113, "userDisplayName": "William McCloskey", "createDate": "1281586083", "userID": 47624451, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281586407", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Pittsburgh", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281582807", "commentSequence": 56, "commentBody": "Maybe this is an economic class issue.

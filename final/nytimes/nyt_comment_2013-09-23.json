Note the absence of a single piece of evidence in his post, as compared to Mr. Krugman's specific reference to academic studies proving the effectiveness of food stamps. In his strangely convoluted second and third sentences he seems to be arguing that the elderly no longer suffer from real want, but then abruptly shifts to an odd conclusion that those who argue for compassion also argue that helping people undermines self-reliance. What? It seems he simply wants to cram the familiar conservative totems in here somewhere, regardless. <br/><br/>As for his claim about the major difference between liberal and conservative principles, his framing of the argument is off-base. Reasonable liberals know full well that removing all fear and want is impossible. They simply want to help those who are in immediate need. Conservatives do believe differently: they don't want to help. And all of this enables him to ignore one of Mr. Krugman's major points--that most SNAP recipients are children or elderly --and fall back on disproven claims that people using food stamps are lazy slacker adults who don't want to work.

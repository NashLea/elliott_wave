One week into SSM, and this article advocates exactly what opponents predicted.  So much for the canard that extending marriage to same sex couples will only \"strengthen\" marriage by extending the social benefits of the institution to a new class of \"families.\" <br/><br/>By definition, our public policy regarding marriage must relate to the public interest.  There is a strong public interest in encouraging stable, self-reliant families, where children are raised by committed parents and each family member can rely on the others to do their part and make sacrifices for mutual good.  There is no public interest in recognizing marriage as a way to make couples feel good about \"validating\" their relationship or maximize their private sexual pleasure.  <br/><br/>A quote attributed to Savage is revealing:  \u201cI acknowledge the advantages of monogamy when it comes to sexual safety, infections, emotional safety, paternity assurances. [Note: nothing about public interest in providing for children and avoiding the social cost of failed families.]  But people in monogamous relationships have to... acknowledge the drawbacks of monogamy around boredom, despair, lack of variety, sexual death and being taken for granted.\u201d  <br/><br/>Savage has it backwards.  Marriage is not about maximizing sexual pleasure.  Sex is about creating and nurturing a family.  It's hard work to stick with a marriage for life, \"for richer or poorer, in sickness or in health.\"  A marriage is making and keeping commitments to each other, to extended family, and to society to stay the course and take care of your own, even though it inevitably involves personal sacrifice, humility, and not always having it your way. When couples make and keep these covenants, society is better off.  That is the public interest behind marriage.<br/><br/>Compare these values to what Savage laments:  the risk that you might at times suffer from \"boredom\", \"lack of [sexual] variety\" or (horrors!) \"being taken for granted.\"  All private interests.", "recommendationCount": 25}, {"assetID": 2917651, "replies": [], "lft": 54, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/sacramento-levees-pose-risk-to-california-and-the-country.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4097961, "rgt": 55, "userDisplayName": "Sally", "createDate": "1309753025", "userID": 50852861, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1309753203", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "St Paul, Mn", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1309749603", "commentSequence": 20, "commentBody": "  So while California requires huge amounts of non energy producing \"green energy\" initiatives it let's vital infrastruture fall apart, anyone hear \"democrats\".", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2911642, "replies": [], "lft": 1202, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4096565, "rgt": 1203, "userDisplayName": "DH", "createDate": "1309714129", "userID": 57693178, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1309753448", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1309749848", "commentSequence": 456, "commentBody": "I thought this was a very well thought out article.

Offspring do better when there are two adults involved in their care and rearing. That we humans are sexually receptive year round rather than seasonally supports that notion, keeps the males interested and around and keeps them tied to their mate. Sure, there is genetic evidence that it's not all Leave It To Beaver land out there, but the fact is there is an emotional bond created with sex, perhaps more on the female's part. It's why I never bought into the free love of the sixties when I was a young adult---it did matter to me and I saw plenty of my women friends hurt by trying to emulate the promiscuity of our men friends who professed to be having the time of their lives but who in fact admitted later to feeling pretty empty about the fly by night couplings.<br/><br/>If you want an open relationship and your partner wants that to, I'm not going to stop you.

Openness about sexual fantasies within a marriage, for example, is a good idea; infidelity is often prompted by a lack of it. But the thrust of his argument is actually nonsensical. He contends that \u201cgiven the [high] rates of infidelity, people who get married should have to swear a blood oath that if it [the marriage] is violated, as traumatic as that would be, the greater good is the relationship.\" This statement can't survive its own unpacking. Because people are unfaithful in large numbers, it argues, they should replace the traditional marriage vow (to be faithful) with a new one: to permit one another to be unfaithful. That is, we should redefine marriage! (Oh my God, the conservatives are right!) The ostensible appeal of the argument is the appearance of its squaring up with human/sexual nature. But it fails entirely on just that score. How many men neglect to stray precisely because their wives would send them packing for doing so? How many more men (to take just men) would cheat on their wives if the get-out-of-jail-free \"blood oath\" proposed by Savage were the new norm? Many more, quite obviously. Anyone comfortable with evading that reality by defining infidelity out of marriage hasn't reached their position by argument, but by nomenclature. Thus, Savage argues, \"the relationship\" must be placed above violations of the marriage. It's \"the greater good.\" But surely violations of the marriage just are violations of the relationship! This is to argue: \"You must put up with my betrayal of our relationship for the sake of our relationship.\" Talk about blaming the victim. The onus is now on the person who honored the relationship to tolerate (indeed, to swear a blood oath to tolerate) the antics of the person who dishonored it--all in the name of the relationship itself. I am willing to hear the case for more flexibility in sexual norms within marriage, but I'm still waiting to hear it.

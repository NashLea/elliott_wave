So I carried those prejudices with me for many years. <br/><br/>When I saw this proposed law for Mississippi, it only reinforced my stereotype of Mississippi. I have read quite a bit about the Civil War, and other American history for many years now, but Mississippi to me, has always seemed to me to be the backwater of the country. It has one of the lowest educational levels and one of the lowest economic levels of any state. It receives more federal money than it contributes, and yet their citizens denigrate liberal California, which sends some of the federal money that Mississippi gets. <br/><br/>So I actually was surprised when this oppressive law was defeated.

It is not a sign of the pro-life movement losing ground. The amendment failed not because Mississippi leans pro-choice after all, but because numerous pro-life organizations, including strongly pro-life Catholic and Methodist leaders, spoke out against it on the grounds that it would not, despite incredible volumes of misinformation from both sides, have actually banned abortions, birth control, or anything at all, even if unchallenged in court. In 1983, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the Supreme Court ruled that a state may not adopt a personhood theory as a means to regulate abortions. Yet the inevitable challenge to this personhood ruling was likely to strengthen existing court doctrine that guarantees a woman's right to an abortion, undermining the pro-life cause by jumping the gun with a load of nonsense. <br/><br/>Over the past several decades, pro-lifers at the forefront of their cause have done their research, and they know they will not ban abortion under the existing Supreme Court. The Mississippi amendment, at best, would have amounted to an official state opinion, much like an official state bird. The only way to ban abortion is to change the presidency, change the Supreme Court, and introduce an explicit criminal prohibition on the destruction of the unborn. <br/><br/>Sleep well tonight, but keep your eyes open going forward. The abortion debate is not over.

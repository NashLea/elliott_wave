This represents the difficulty in criticizing these social media technologies. To a large extent, these technologies are revolutionizing society; connecting people who would have lost touch, bringing together those of similar interests, and, in certain circumstances like the Arab Spring, giving a collective voice to silenced individuals. Why are we so resistant to Facebook Graph when all it does is try to connect and guide us further? After much thought, I believe that my hostility comes from fear. I am concerned that Facebook\u2019s new technologies are going to tap so far into my social network that I will fail to upkeep my own social network, separate from Facebook. Therefore, in response to user rugao\u2019s statement \u201cthere is so much prejudice and trashing already.

What was acceptable -- and safe -- in the 1960s is irresponsible and potentially dangerous in 2013.  What is safe in one city or town, or region of the country, is not necessarily so in another.  What DG of NYC (post below) is doing with her 9-year-old is neglectful, by my measurement.  It's also unkind.  I was a \"latchkey\" kid from the age of 11, and I hated coming home to an empty house.  I remember a man stopping his car beside me when I was walking home from school, and trying to lure me in.  And then I arrived home to no one.  By the time I was 13 I was happy to not have Mom off at work, but a 9-year-old is still very much a child who needs protection and security. Too young to be home alone.<br/><br/>My mother told me it was time to do my own wash as soon as I was tall enough to reach the washing machine.  Ditto cooking, although we rotated that chore around he family. Responsibility is good for children, as long as it is age appropriate.  Don't tell the 7-year-old to take care of the dog as some sort of life lesson..  The dog will suffer.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 3356229, "replies": [], "lft": 13, "assetURL": "http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/prince-harry-compares-war-to-playstation-and-taliban-is-not-amused/", "parentID": 8122330, "commentID": 8125524, "rgt": 14, "userDisplayName": "Tim", "createDate": "1358920024", "userID": 66811400, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1359176616", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Perth", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1359176616", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "She comes from a family that produced Churchill and the Duke of Malborough one of Britain's greatest military leaders.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3355960, "replies": [], "lft": 31, "assetURL": "http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/rallies-against-gun-control/", "parentID": 8112059, "commentID": 8126306, "rgt": 32, "userDisplayName": "Pierre", "createDate": "1358943743", "userID": 36130499, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1359176630", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1359176630", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I live in New York City and I feel like it is the safest city in the USA, the best city I can imagine raising my kids in, thanks to the recent gun control legislation.

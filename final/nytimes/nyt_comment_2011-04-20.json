We're about to start a study now looking at driving in teens and young adults using a driving simulator -- and we're definitely not the only lab doing this type of research. If you're a parent interested in getting this type of experience for your teen, I'd recommend doing a google search and looking for research opportunities.<br/><br/>Several commenters have added that we should really be looking at impulsivity or \"reckless drivers\" even though this study clearly shows that those behaviors only contribute to a small subset of crashes. However, I think they do have a point -- the authors say that they were only looking at the most proximal pre-crash event. A more comprehensive view of the causal chain leading up to the pre-crash event may find that poor decision making (of which reckless driving is only a small subset) occurred in many of these crashes. Studying crashes can only go so far -- research using new technologies, such as simulators and video-equipped smart cars, can tell us more about the events leading up to an accident, and is the next step in this line of research.<br/><br/>To commenter #23, T in PDX, there certainly have been studies that have looked at novice drivers of different ages.

He has also energized many young voters and progressives, and hopefully they will get to the polls in November and in 2018, even if Senator Sanders is not the nominee.  <br/><br/>I am not as convinced by his narrative and his solutions.  As an example, mass incarceration started long before the Clinton administration and is a huge problem at the state level.  As another example, the long decline of manufacturing started long before NAFTA, or TPP, or most-favored nation status for China.  As another example, a $15 minimum wage for the entire country (as opposed to a smaller increase or indexing to inflation) would be a disaster for young workers, marginally-skilled workers, students, and part-timers.  As a last example, there is a big difference between making college free versus making college affordable.<br/><br/>Putting aside Senator Sanders, I am troubled by how many of his supporters have decided that Secretary Clinton is untrustworthy (swallowing the Republican line), or corporate, or conservative.

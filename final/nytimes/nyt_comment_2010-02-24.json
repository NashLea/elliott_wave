Just discussing this problem is, I believe, helpful. One thing the bulk of your comments has clarified for me is that there is some real paranoia on both sides of this issue. High profile stories like that of Dr. Amy Bishop helps to drive this paranoia. It was an incredibly tragic story but the truth is that this tragedy is virtually an anomaly. The sort of thing (a Phd using a handgun to fatally shoot colleagues?) that never happens (almost!). The same can be said about the handful of tragic stories that has dominated the news over the last several years (Columbine, Virginia Tech, etc.). The news saturation leaves the impression that these events are going on everywhere all the time. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />I can talk about this as someone whose life was severely challenged by a gun. This gun was used to murder my brother in 1981. True, it was not the gun that killed my brother, the criminal who used it was entirely to blame. I have never wanted anything in my life more than to respond by getting a gun and ...<br /><br />I am absolutely convinced that if I chose to accquire a gun I could  successfully do so. I DO NOT CHOOSE TO PURCHASE, ACQUIRED OR POSSESS A GUN. In my case, I know that it would not be wise in the long or short term.<br /><br />I am amazed that there are many who are not like me. They are gun enthusiasts. One friend of mine recently told me that he is always armed. He is a law enforcement official. A significant majority of police officers go through their entire career without firing their weapons in the line of duty. Similarly, there are innumerable citizens who are responsible gun enthusiasts who are able to possess guns without it ending in inevitable tragedy.<br /><br />It is also amazing that criminals have absolutely no difficulty acquiring guns. Although the law forbids it, they (criminals) are experts in activities which are illegal, and new or more restrictive gun laws are ineffectual when it comes to criminals.<br /><br />Perhaps, American freedom means that each of us must personally deal with the gun proliferation problem in our country.

What gangs and from where they were never asked nor did they comment on their own unless the reporter deleted it. This is just another move in other states by other white men that fear anyone that's not exactly like they are.( There are a few of color but not in the same proportion or number.)  Obama knew of this then and most likely beforehand.  He told the President of Mexico that he had no chance in the near future to put up gun-control bills--never really clarified why other than attitudes known of all Republicans and some Democrats that if one gun is controlled the government will take away all of them.  Also with inside and outside \"possibilities\" of terrorist acts he didn't feel he could justify federal gun control.  If so many are backing states' rights then I hope the states also are responsible for any of the injuries or deaths their state citizens may cause by having a gun in their possession.  Open gun carrying was done last week at some meeting in San Francisco--Liberal?? and gun controlled??  Until more people--esp white poorly educated men get back to work, we are going to see a lot of this foolishness.  Did anyone see the action of the KKK in all its sheets and glory in Georgia today??  The \"rats\" are coming out of the cellar.  Where there is one, there are many--in groups.

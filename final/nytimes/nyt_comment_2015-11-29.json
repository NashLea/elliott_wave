This team is making history -- for all basketball fans.   If you're just about the Suns winning, you need to step back and sort things out.  This is about basketball.  It's not about you.  Resenting another team's success, denying their achievement,<br/>is really small and pinched.  Hope you're better than that.  The Suns deserve better too.

So much so that in the 1980s I started a small charitable organization to promote good will through the sport of baseball. We raised donations of new and used baseball mitts, bats, balls, shoes, catcher's gear, and jerseys and distributed them, together with toys and educational supplies, to the most impoverished kids in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Costa Rica. We raised a significant quantity of regalos (gifts) for the kids thanks to the generosity of companies like Mizuno USA and Toys \"R\" Us. Our efforts were non-political and non-partisan; we were interested only in generating a little fun, smiles and happiness--fleeting though it may have been. I'll never forget pitching to the 14-year-old son of the Sandinista mayor of Corinto. With his dad serving as the catcher sans mask or any other protective gear, and a large crowd cheering the kid on, he smacked my fastballs and curveballs like they were flies on a wall, much to the delight of the crowd and his dad. (Where was Dennis Martinez when he was needed?!!) <br/><br/>Anyway, the only country to deny us entry to do our gift-giving was Cuba. They must have thought we were CIA agents, which is laughable in light of our mistreatment by the Guatemalan government and military. But I did not give up on Cuba. In 2003, while on a business trip to Cuba, I gave an antique mitt to the Castro brothers, whose cooperation I sought for my client, along with a copy of Founding Brothers.

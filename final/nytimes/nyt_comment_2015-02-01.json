Sadly, many of these patients die miserable deaths.  Almost everyone I have met would want to die a \"good death\": peaceful, enjoying what little time they have left, surrounded by friends and family.

I have watched as they died, some in agony and some peacefully, some over many months and some quickly.  I have been unburdened of any belief that medicine saves lives.  At most it alters the mode of death or defers it.  In the end all of us must deal with the consequences of our mortality and the often-painful machinations of disease.<br/><br/>What medicine can do, and should become even better at doing, is relieve the symptoms of disease and injury.  Those of my family who were prepared for death by experienced and caring hospice nurses retained more of their abilities and endured less discomfort than most of those who did not.  The drugs and medical devices that eased their failing bodies and reasserted their dignity were made available before they were needed, and the family was coached in their use.<br/><br/>\"Do not go gentle into that good night\" may seem romantic and heroic, but in the end having the option of a more gentle departure from this life is for most the much better choice.  I appreciate the doctors for their tenacious efforts to stave off death, but I hold the hospice nurses who have helped my family on too many occasions deep in my heart.", "recommendationCount": 105}, {"assetID": 3420908, "replies": [], "lft": 1004, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-disneyland-measles-and-madness.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 13998611, "rgt": 1005, "userDisplayName": "gary miller", "createDate": "1422767244", "userID": 67314411, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1422767286", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "laguna niguel", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1422767286", "commentSequence": 13998611, "commentBody": "When I was a child in the mid 1950's we had a neighbor kid with one leg shorter than the other due to having had polio.

Any doctor will tell you, post vaccine, that your child will likely experience a rash, maybe some vomiting, crankiness, sleeplessness, as their immune system responds to the injected antigens. This is good, it means the vaccine is working.  It also means, to me, that injection of antigens is different from normal daily exposures. Most children do not experience rashes, sleeplessness, long bouts of crying everyday, but only after a vaccine.  <br/><br/>I am not saying that vaccination is a bad decision.  I am saying that the CDC logic that multiple simultaneous vaccines is the same as multiple daily exposure to bacteria, etc. is very dishonest. It is effectively a lie. It also calls into question their assurance that multiple vaccines are certainly no more dangerous than single vaccines. There is currently no evidence otherwise - this is all they really have.  If the CDC is so sure of these things, then communicate the evidence to the public - don't give me nonsense that vaccines are the same as oral exposure to dirt and bacteria.

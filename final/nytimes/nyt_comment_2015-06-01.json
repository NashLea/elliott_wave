But the show has been compelling, thoughtful, rich, and complex. Honestly graphic but not gratuitously so, it covers depths of emotional pain and recovery for a victim of torture such as I've never seen in a television series. The acting is superb and I can only imagine how difficult these scenes were to film. I loved the romantic sweep of the earlier shows and now I am willing to pay the price - realizing that just as every human being has a gritty backstory, so should every well done fictional character.

Everything that happened in the episode was something Jamie described to Claire in the book.  The rape (although they left out the whipping in the show), the constant back and forth from Randall of inflicting pain and then tenderness, Randall wanting Jamie to profess love to him, Randall's jealousy/annoyance with Jamie's love of Claire (the hold she has on him), etc.  They actually left out alot of the bloody moments, and the moment when Randall becomes crazed.  I felt what was displayed was enough to show the audience how horrific the prison time was but not as excessive as what was laid out in the book.  I do agree with you that it would have been nice to have more time devoted to Claire trying to reach Jamie in the darkness, rehabilitate him, heal him.  Even an additional 10 minutes added to the show would have been helpful and not left me feeling that the episode was too long.

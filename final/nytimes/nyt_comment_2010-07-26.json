For how long we should trust this unreliable partner as our ally. Why we should invest billions of tax money to a country which is directly involved in massacring our kids .

No doubt the world is a complicated place but there are times when simple black and white thinking are required. Such is the case now. Students of history know how many times president Eisenhower threatened to use atomic weapons against other countries to gain American foreign policy objectives, he made such threats many times, and was part of a generation that would not tolerate Americans being pushed around. Some really dirty things were done in those days like coups in Latin America and Iran, but look at the type of people we have to deal with today. The deadly great game that is taking American lives in Afghanistan while we hide confused behind our international law and prohibitions against covert actions and assassinations. Remember how afraid the CIA was to kill Bin Laden before 9-11. President Clinton could not get the CIA to act because they were afraid the act was illegal.<br /><br />The truth is the key to the projection of American power in this region is covert action. The U.S. must be willing to kill any Pakistani in the military and intelligence that is aiding the Taliban.Larger covert operations should be used against Pakistani politicians  and parties sympathetic to the Taliban.  Just as they smile in our faces and help the Taliban kill our troops we should smile back and kill them covertly.  The U.S. should also begin to covertly form and aid border militias that can operate in Pakistan and threaten Pakistan's sovereign control. A real threat to Pakistan would be if the U.S. began to back insurgents in Baluchistan and of course deny it but offer to help stop the insurgency when Pakistan secures its border with Afghanistan.

Finally, they were paid and fed, and presumably went back to building the royal tombs. Egyptian civilization has a history spanning several millennia, dense with subtleties unimagined by the U.S. Hollywood epic movie machine, which has produced a distorted and gaudy image of Egypt starring Elizabeth Taylor and the Treasures of King Tut. We are caught by surprise and amazed because we know so little, in truth, about the other peoples of the world, living as we do in our relatively narrow and self-absorbed \"reality\" show. Here is to the youth of Egypt and Tunisia and Yemen and perhaps Iran and onward across the world for standing up for their futures; for realizing that the future is theirs to win or lose.

And transportation.  Does anyone not benefit from the federal system of interstate highways?  Don't kid yourselves folks, if you are thinking you don't 'benefit' from any government programs. You have things in your home right now that were affordable to you only because the federal government benefited your personal life by building an interstate highway and rail system to transport goods and food.<br /><br />We all benefits from sharing the earth's resources.

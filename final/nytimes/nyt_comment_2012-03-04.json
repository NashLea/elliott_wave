When I was 16, I spent a summer in London after a tournament training with a development squad run through Arsenal's youth academy and I was woefully lacking in technical ability compared to my European counterparts. By a mile. And I started on a team that went on to win the Illinois soccer state title my senior year and won tournaments in different parts of the country, so I played at among the highest non-collegiate levels here. It's nothing compared to Europe. The scholastic teams (and the majority of youth leagues) are more concerned with the success of the team, and to a lesser extent having fun, than player development. In the major European academies, keeping score is seldom done. The emphasis is on technical training and building skills to one day play for club and country, not fielding a team that wins some kind of \"Tournament of Academies.\" <br/><br/>Honestly, this program makes all the sense in the world and I cannot comprehend any of it's critics. The \"let the kids play\" and \"this hurts the school programs\" miss the point entirely. This is what kids who want a shot to play at the elite levels want to do, I would have done anything for a shot at this. The idea that only a few kids will rise up and make it is exactly the point, creating truly elite players.

Canadians seem to be more concerned with the welfare of the public at large and don't seem to be particularly preoccupied with finding some group that is somehow undeserving of the benefits of public policies and institutions -  e.g., Canadians cherish a health care system that is more concerned with health and less involved in passing glib moral judgments on the practices of some targeted group of individuals. Maybe that's because Canadians realize that someday they might be a member of one of those targeted groups, or maybe one of their kids might become a member of one of those groups, or the kid next door, or someone they know up the street, or maybe someone they don't even know who still somehow manages to carry some small spark of humanity. RE: paying for recreational drugs - check out the literature on prescribed heroin - we can pay to treat addicts effectively or we can pay to police and jail a class of dealers, but we are going to pay. A little less narcissistic overinvolvement in moralizing and a little more reality orientation might enlighten a political discourse that people like Limbaugh and institutions like Fox news are dragging back to the dark ages, via an extended layover in fantasy land.

In either case, you actually have to produce a clear statement that is subject to validation.  <br/><br/>Just carping about how hard it all is, or throwing out words like parameter and viscosity, is not science. For the zillionth time---we don't discard theories because they make an inaccurate  prediction. We modify them; any of you guys is welcome to produce a modification to ACC if it is consistent with the laws of physics and comes in the proper scientific form. Predict something, and give us the math and physics to back it up.

I have to tell you, the most aggresive humans in the world migrated here not only for opportunity or greed, but also for the \"Freedom\" to get away with it! Very few came here for spiritual freedom. The Puritan's being one group. You must realize the most aggresive and dangerous people of the world are here. We need leadership that shows us the errors of our ways. Someone to make people reflect inward to see those errors. The nearest thing to that are our spiritual leaders, at least the ones who preach as Jesus did, not the ones making Revelation come true.

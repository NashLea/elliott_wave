We started by drawing letters in the air - all together.  Like physical exercises - except with one arm.  (With no possibility of making a mistake either!)  Only once they got the motion of each letter did we move to writing on paper.  I began with the simplest letters like \"e\" and \"l\" and we all had fun looping them in the air.  You can picture each letter with a whole class of children enjoying learning to write cursivein the air.  <br/><br/>All the children learned to write beautifully.  And my handwriting improved too!<br/><br/>Following that time I ended up studying clinical psychology.  So this article is immensely fascinating to me on the neural level.<br/><br/>I think it would be a great shame for people to lose the ability to write.  If I'm writing a poem, for example, I really need to write it down.  Typing would never work for that type of thinking.  At least not for me.<br/><br/>It strikes me that if handwriting in childhood helps children to learn more quickly, what about the elderly?  Should I be writing more and typing less to preserve or enhance my cognitive abilities?  Should I maybe try writing words or letters in the air?  Or teach myself to write that way using my left hand too?<br/><br/>Lots of avenues for research and creative thinking - all from this one article!

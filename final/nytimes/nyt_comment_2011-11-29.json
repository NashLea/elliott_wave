If the average American took the time to read up on what is actually happening to our country they would then understand that they are being pushed off the cliff by the very people they vote for---The Republican Party. Republicans are bought and paid for as a whole---democrats are bought and paid for as a bunch, but not all. Until we have a third party--and we will soon, we can only do the prudent thing and vote against the party that will most certainly continue to destroy middle class America---the Republican Party.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3292744, "replies": [], "lft": 216, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/science/human-natures-pathologist.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4963592, "rgt": 217, "userDisplayName": "Grandgousier", "createDate": "1322546633", "userID": 63865619, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1322546654", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Berkeley, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1322546654", "commentSequence": 83, "commentBody": "Mr. Pinker and so many like him (Wilson, et. al) are too focused on the ape side of human for explanations of our 'nature' and hence, behaviors.

In only 2 generations we have known extreme violence, and extreme peace.  Early on that got me thinking about cycles of violence in a global and historical sense.  My conclusion is that we today have absolutely no sense of how bad things were for our ancestors.<br/><br/>As bad as WW1 and WW2 were, as bad as the Genocide was, the Taiping Rebellion, etc, they pale in comparison to the inhumanity of the past.  Genocides of entire peoples have littered world history long before the industrial revolution, wholesale slaughter of entire populations, purges of all the men in an area, enslavement of the women, wars aimed solely to destroy a culture, these are regular markers of the past.  These are also things we in the modern age have long forgotten.<br/><br/>As humans were are blinded by our inability to see things from a broad perspective; the current wars, conflicts, famines, etc all engage our mind.  We are also blind to the amazing degree to which we have developed codified rules, limitations on power, ethics and norms which have curtailed our excesses. We think nothing of these, and act as if they account for little.  Yet in the broad sweep of history, our modern institutions are light-years away from anything in the past. In a way these are a product of evolution, a manifestation of our tendencies towards increasing order when the conditions are right. <br/><br/>In a way we are spoiled, and tend to believe what we see today is more important than anything in the past, more risque, more dangerous, more brutal, etc.  We fall prey to looking back on the past as some sort of halcyon era, a \"better time,\" a mistake made by many posters here.

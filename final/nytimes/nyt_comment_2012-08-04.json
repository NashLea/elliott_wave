Instead, he egged on the GOP's ever rightward march on issue after issue and flirted with the most absurd of the conspiracy theories that occupy the minds of folks who watch too much Fox \"News.\" <br/><br/>Since the primaries, Romney has continued on this path. Romney spoke at Liberty University and said nothing against that school's refusal to admit openly gay or lesbian students. Romney spoke to the NRA and gave tacit support to that group's ridiculous conspiracy theories about President Obama and guns. Romney trumpeted the endorsement of Ann Coulter, who has said that her \"only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building\u201d and that she wants \"Jews to be perfected\" by becoming Christians. Romney won't disavow his own church's past practice of posthumously baptizing dead Jews. <br/><br/>Today's conservative movement is chock full of opportunities for a candidate to show some spine by standing up for reality, rather than crazed lunacy.

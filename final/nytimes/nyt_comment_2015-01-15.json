The description about how when the adoptees are in Korea, they don't feel fully Korean, and when they are in the U.S., they don't feel fully American applies to me too. But, between the two, I definitely identify much more as an American, which the adoptees say they cannot because they grew up with white parents. I grew up in the U.S. with *Korean* parents and still feel more American than Korean -- mostly because of how women are treated in Korea. I've only been there twice, but in that short time, I saw how unpleasant it was for women. When I'm in the U.S., I can be me and feel a thousand times more accepted here than in Korea. So, I think the adoptees are feeling the loss of their birth families and somehow equating it to losing Korean culture. But even if you grew up with Korean parents in the U.S., you're still going to lose that culture. My mom watches some Korean dramas and is turned off by some of what she sees because she is more American culturally. She finds the rate of plastic surgery there outrageous, and my whole life has railed again the education system there (even though she excelled in it). Don't imagine that just having parents who are ethnically Korean will mean you grow up culturally Korean. Some ethnic Koreans move to the U.S. and prefer the culture here and would raise their kids that way, as mine did.", "recommendationCount": 63}, {"assetID": 3419656, "replies": [], "lft": 71, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/opinion/conservatives-in-name-only.html", "parentID": 13839243, "commentID": 13839541, "rgt": 72, "userDisplayName": "RLS", "createDate": "1421298017", "userID": 59813027, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1421298073", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Virginia", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1421298073", "commentSequence": 13839541, "commentBody": "Exactly right, BD.

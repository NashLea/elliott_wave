So many boys have lost their boyhood, their religion, their dignity and wholesomeness, their adult lives because of the predations of the priests their families admire , respect, adore and entertain in their homes.  There is no answer to these dreadful problems of prostitution among underage girls in all the cities in America from coast to coast. No answer, either,  to the issue of priestly abuse - beyond our comprehension.  One can only hope that evil priests will be brought to justice somehow (what Abelard suffered is too good for them) and that pimps will be thrown into the slammer without their hats, sunglasses and fancy wheels.  As for the johns, users and \"clients\" (too nice a word for them) who are buying these girls - may they suffer a debilitating and wasting disease and ASAP. Theirs' is not a \"victimless\" crime, and they are well aware that their lust for young prostitutes is as bad as the same wolfish lust the celibate, abstinent priest (sic) indulges himself in with the tenderest of lambs in his flock..

But even more, I suspect our failure of compassion, our quick turns to neglect or judgment, lie in the intimacy of domestic trafficking:  not simply that these girls may be our daughters, but that their fates sharply illuminate our culture's failings in both the most public and private fora.  It is domestic trafficking in every sense of the term, for all that parents do not actively sell their children.  <br/><br/>And it is this domestic dimension, the very intimacy of this trafficking, that moves us to judge, condemn the victim\u2014else we must needs judge, condemn, ourselves.<br/><br/>And two final points:  How many of these girls are LGBT?  And what about trafficked boys\u2014boys who, if anything, are even more likely to be judged, condemned, abandoned than are girls?", "recommendationCount": 17}, {"assetID": 2661747, "replies": [], "lft": 18, "assetURL": "http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/human-trafficking-in-the-united-states/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3729144, "rgt": 19, "userDisplayName": "Kyle Marler, End Demand NYC", "createDate": "1303601488", "userID": 61945051, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303632804", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303629204", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "The point is that there are far more men that are looking to buy sex than there are women that are willing (voluntarily) to be prostitutes.

I actually agree that the Roberts court has been too political and result-oriented, especially in the Citizens United and Hobby Lobby decisions, which the court got wrong. As for the Second Amendment, I haven't looked closely at the court's decisions in this area so cannot comment extensively (except that from what I have heard, even Antonin Scalia believes that significant gun control measures are allowed under the constitution). In any event, whether or not the court has gotten Second Amendment analysis right, I stand by my position that the court probably will not stretch \"Established by the State\" to mean \"Established by the State or Federal Government.\" That's a big stretch, and would require a lot of contextual interpretation to get to that this court (even the liberal justices) probably will not undertake. Ultimately, the statutory language has to count for something."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 13288183, "replies": [], "commentID": 13293403, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Meredith", "createDate": "1415640362", "userID": 28617892, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1415640367", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Patrick", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NYC", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1415640367", "commentSequence": 13293403, "commentBody": "Not just the 2nd amend to allow guns for all is warped.

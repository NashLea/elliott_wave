Ironically, these secular elites are also supported by many from the poor and illiterate class (45% of Egypt), who rightfully accuse the Brotherhood of being as neglectful as Mubarak in improving their dire economic conditions. The youth of this class is also more interested in football than the Quran, a book they cannot read in the first place, and they are more prone to street violence.

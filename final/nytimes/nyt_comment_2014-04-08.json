First, the question of the danger of sailing the oceans. It is natural to magnify the danger of the unknown, and since we are land-based mammals, it seems terribly unnatural and dangerous to ever be out-of-sight of land. But the fact is that sailing around the world in a 36-foot boat is quite safe, as long as you choose the right time of year to cross each ocean. My wife and I spent 4 years circumnavigating in a 36-foot boat, and it was safer than a lot of things we've experienced on dry land. Before we left, friends and family came to say 'goodbye,' and the expressions on their faces made clear that they were seeing us for the last time. For a couple of them it was, as they died while we were gone. Done properly, it's quite safe. Another thing, neither of the problems they had had anything to do with the age of the child. The mother could have been the one with a rash, or the father. The steering problem had nothing to do with the fact that there were two small children aboard. The fact is that it is just a case of a family with a couple of problems quite unrelated to the hysteric rants posted here.

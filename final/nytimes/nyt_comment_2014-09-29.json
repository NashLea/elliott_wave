Its preselected 'scholars' write pieces at the behest of its plutocratic funders and masters. Why should America, the richest country on earth, have poor Americans at the 74th percentile among all people of the world? The vast majority of the worlds population, outside of northern Europe, are desperately poor by US standards. That's not a scale you want to be compared to. It's just a convenient measuring stick when you want to make a disingenuous point about how good our poor have it. Per the rich, 'Nothing to see here folks, just move along.'<br/><br/>For a rich society, our working poor actually seem to be grossly under-compensated. Put another way, 26% of the people around the world, most of them probably in first world countries, do better than the poor in the US. I think that speaks to both profound wealth maldistribution and broken social and economic practices in the richest country the world has ever known.

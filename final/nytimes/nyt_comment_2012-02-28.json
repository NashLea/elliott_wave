This despite the fact that his own are built upon a foundation no less (and in most instances more) dependant upon faith and the imposition of dogma than those of the sincerly devout.  Athiests, skeptics, and agnostics consistently adhere to a self-serving world view which demands from them nothing more noble or productive than a surrender to passion, unstable emotion, momentary whim, or primal appetite.  They then insultingly presume an air of enlightenment, ridiculing those who genuinely seek after a moral existence.

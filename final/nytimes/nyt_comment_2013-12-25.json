It also underlines the need to stop taxing capital gains at lower rates than earned income.<br/><br/>When a middle class person sells the family home, there are large transfer taxes.  When a rich person sells an equivalent amount of stock, there is no tax at all.  Few large stock transactions are done by middle class people, so this amounts to subsidizing the rich.<br/><br/>A much larger percent of rich people's income is the result of capital gains than it is of middle class people.  Almost all of these gains are trades in existing stock which do not involve innovation or job creation.  But the rich person's capital gains taxes are about half the middle class person's tax on equivalent earned income.<br/><br/>These things are unwise and immoral subsidies to the already rich.  Transaction taxes on stock sales, and higher taxes on capital gains, are needed.  Similarly, inheritance taxes are now virtually non-existent, another blow to the middle class and subsidy to the rich.<br/><br/>Tax unearned income!  Tax stock transactions! Tax inheritance!

Even if entering the house is a crime, I don't believe it is always one that deserves death.<br/><br/>However, I am not not going to say anything as silly as saying that the homeowner should have attempted to shoot the offender in a non-lethal location. That sort of thing might work in the movies, but in practice, if you're going to use a gun you should shoot to kill.<br/><br/>So what does that leave us with? It leaves us with no easy answer. Both sides of the argument have good points to make, and the reality of how guns work limit the number of most likely outcomes. If anything, I would argue that the only thing that can be said is that laws that make a clear determination--one way or another--are pretty much the only wrong answer. A law which always prohibits gun use in situations like these would be wrong, just as a law is that always allows it.

In fact, I mentioned in my original post the possibility of a popular/electoral split and that I doubt it would occur once the popular vote differences between the candidates exceed about 0.5%. Actually, I might amend this up to, say, 1%, but after that, the electoral college is unlikely to out-of-whack with the popular vote. Mr. Silver has made this point himself--i.e. if it's not a very close electon in the popular vote, then there won't be a popular/electoral split.<br/><br/>Moreover, I believe that the national polls are trending strongly toward Romney in recent days. Just take a look at the three most recent national polls, which are listed on Real Clear Politics.<br/><br/>I recommend that all of you check out the individual polls and make up your own minds about things, rather than rely on aggregated information on 538 or anywhere else. That being said, I think that--only because of Ohio and Romney's \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt\" editorial--Obama has a chance (maybe 50-50) of winning this election.", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

It carries trucks, as well as passengers and the fares are much, much less.  5 cents a passenger mile versus $1 per passenger mile for Amtrak.  Amazingly, Japan has developed a superconducting Maglev train that uses the invention of the two American's who invented it, Drs. James Powell and Gordon Danby, and they propose to demonstrate the system in the US between Baltimore and Washington, DC.  Their first investment was in a very powerful lobbying team.  Japan Maglev is the passenger only 1st gen system.  Powell and Danby have kept working and now have a system which lifts trucks, electronically switches and can be build along the Interstates with private investment and not require subsidies to construct or operate.  see:  <a href=\"http://www.magneticglide.com\" title=\"www.magneticglide.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.magneticglide.com</a><br/><br/>It can make you a little crazy.", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 3410881, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 12810429, "replies": [], "commentID": 12812140, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "mossbloom", "createDate": "1410787876", "userID": 42609600, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1410799125", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 1, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Steve C.", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Angels Camp CA", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1410795525", "commentSequence": 12812140, "commentBody": "Speaking as a 'Nam vet, I would say you're spot on, Steve.

Howard would walk through his factories, he knew the assembly line employees, the janitors, the engineers.

The deniers should look up two things: Bill Clinton's \"National Homeownership Strategy\" and GW Bush's \"Ownership Society\", which was a rebranding of the Clinton program. <br/><br/>But that's not the end of the story. By 2007-8, with all those toxic assets based on fraudulent mortgages on the books, there was still a way to correct the problem: loan restructuring. This would equalize the loss in value seen by both lenders and borrowers, rather than have borrowers suffer all the loss, with lenders protected from loss. The justifications for this radical solution would have been (1) the lenders' toxic assets' values were fraudulent, and (2) protecting the toxic assets' values was not possible anyway without other extreme measures, such as bailing out banks and QE by the Fed. The benefits of this solution would have been a lower private debt load, which would have allowed higher consumer spending, which would have kept the economy growing. And we wouldn't still have toxic assets on the books six years after a crash that never should have happened."}]}, "lft": 282, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/opinion/paul-krugman-how-to-get-economic-policy-wrong.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 12810524, "rgt": 295, "userDisplayName": "Baron95", "createDate": "1410755831", "userID": 61792215, "replyCount": 6, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1410755886", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Westport, CT", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1410752286", "commentSequence": 12810524, "commentBody": "There was only one big failure in economic policy that disproportionately contributed to the crisis.<br/><br/>And Dr. Krugman never ever raised it, before, during or after the crisis.<br/><br/>The US is the only country in the world where 2 government sponsored organizations and a government agency control the financing for over 90% of the residential real estate market.

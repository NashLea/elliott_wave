They don't have the cognitive ability to understand cause and effect, nor is intent judged the same way. 3yos cannot make predictions based on experience and facts the way adults can. So, when a 3yo slips his guardians, that is an accident. Everything that happens afterwards continues to be an accident, whether or not the child jumps into the enclosure or falls.<br/><br/>And every 3yo child has had a guardian look away for the split second it would take for the child to slip away. I'd place Vegas money on that. I've seen the most calm and lucid child do the most unexpected things, and again, I'd bet every parent or guardian of a toddler has said at one time or another, \"I had no idea the child would have done _____.\" Spirited child or no. <br/><br/>Also, little kids say crazy things from the moment they wake up. This kid could have been saying, \"I want to pet the lions, I want to ride the giraffes, I'm going to go hug the otters.\" Kids will say, \"I will never go near the pool, Mommy\" and then end up drowning minutes later. 3yos are not reliable sources for predicting their own behavior. Parents need to make judgment calls, and entering a zoo--where, according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, visitors to zoos are primary women/mothers and 2 out of every 3 visitors has a child with them--the expectation is a level of child safety knowing that any kid is capable of losing control; barriers need to be better."}]}, "lft": 262, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/who-is-to-blame-when-a-child-wanders-at-the-zoo/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 18696741, "rgt": 277, "userDisplayName": "Margaret Setterholm", "createDate": "1464750181", "userID": 43063677, "replyCount": 7, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1464754237", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Yonkers NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1464833575", "commentSequence": 18696741, "commentBody": "Just because ANY parent wakes up and says to themselves that they will have a wonderful day with the kids doesn't excuse a serious lapse in judgement.

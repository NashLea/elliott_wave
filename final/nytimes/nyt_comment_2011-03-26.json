Worst of all, our elected officials in Washington not only do not learn from bitter experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, they appear eager to send more young Americans off to fight and die in yet another country that has not attacked us and has no capacity to do so.

In attacking Libya without any self-defense justication whatsoever -- and without any legislative authority from Congress -- President Obama has directly violated Article I of the Constitution and the War Powers Act (Joint Resolution) of 1973, Section 2(c) of which clearly prohibits the President from introducting US armed forces into \"hostilities\" unless there has been: \"(1) a declaration of war; (2) specific statutory authorization; or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.\" Surely there can be no greated abuse of power by the President than unlawfully and unconstitutionally plunging us into a non-defensive war of choice. President Obama deserves to be impeached; and if Congress really has any regard for its sworn oath \"to uphold and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States, Congress should commence impeachment proceedings immediately.

I am looking forward to reading your eloquent words for many more years to come, in whatever medium you may choose.\r<br/><br/>Now on to my last comment on a Bob Herbert column: It is my fervent hope that the news that our largest corporation, G.E., not only pays no taxes but may be entitled to a refund/government welfare/kickback, will inspire more people to raise their fists and their voices in anger. Judging from recent history, neither our corporate president nor Congress will stand up to the oligarchs who control them and on whom they depend for their continued holds on power.\r<br/><br/>Just this past January, Obama appointed Immelt of G.E. to lead his White House Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, either oblivious to or ignorant of the fact that this is a man who makes bucketloads of profits by outsourcing jobs. Also in January, former campaign manager David Plouffe returned to the White House, fresh from a stint as a G.E. \"consultant.\" Notice that the word lobbyist is not being uttered, but just in case, Plouffe has promised to recuse himself from any matters relating to G.E. for the next two years. What a sigh of relief I breathed on hearing that! Ditto for Chief of Staff Bill Daley, late of JP Morgan Chase, who divested himself of his banker perks and will act solely in the interests of the American people. Cough, cough.\r<br/><br/>I have reached the sad conclusion that Obama is a mere front man for G.E., Wall Street, WalMart and anyone and everyone in the Forbes 400. The big contest between Republicans and Democrats is to see who can grab the most billionaires for their campaign war chests. This government no longer belongs to us - so it is up to us to do something about it. Strikes, demonstrations, a constant drumbeat of bad publicity for the politicians - whatever it takes.\r<br/><br/>While our elected officials posture and pander and scramble over the latest social upheavals in the Middle East, they seem not to be noticing the ever-growing social unrest here at home. They ignore it at their own peril.\r<br/><br/><a href=\"http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com/\" title=\"http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com/</a>", "recommendationCount": 1008}, {"assetID": 2565919, "replies": [], "lft": 26, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/opinion/26herbert.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3598361, "rgt": 27, "userDisplayName": "Jon Jost", "createDate": "1301108302", "userID": 14034119, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1301117252", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seoul, Korea", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1301113652", "commentSequence": 17, "commentBody": "Well said Mr Herbert, in this column and all the others.  You have been one of the few in the mainstream press who has called it like it really is, plain and clear.<br/><br/>Yes, the US has lost its way, perhaps a bit earlier than we understood at the moment.  It was well on its way to getting lost immediately after WWII, when it took on the mantle of Europe's colonialism.  It's been uphill in a way since - grabbing easy access to all those raw resources to be had, making us \"rich\" along the way; and it's been downhill since as our society segmented and corruption - a natural partner to such imperialism - took root.  Now it has utterly taken over, as Mr Imelt's position makes clear just who is running the country's government, and for whom.<br/><br/>The social-economic disparities, along with the arrogance at the top end, will result, as utterly predictable, in an American Tahrir Square (and probably just like there a push back from the military, which after all is now one of the major beneficiaries of our plutocracy.)<br/><br/>Sooner the better.

They key thing is that vehicles go twice as long and more before we junk them.  When we produce one car now we are in effect producing two or more by the standards of the late 60s or early 70s.  This and other improvements in quality are not fully taken into account in the statistics you base your reasoning on.  <br/><br/>Officially the percentage of people falling below the poverty threshold is higher than it was in 1973, the year when that percentage was lowest.<br />\nBut the percentage of households without a vehicle is much lower now.  It was something in the area of 20 percent then, I think it has been something in the area of 8 percent recently.  <br/><br/>But, what is more there were figures a number of years ago that split households into a number of income categories.  In the top three categories about 5 percent of all households did not have a vehicle.  Clearly they could afford one, but they did not have one for various non-economic reasons.  Perhaps the driver had lost his licence because of drunk driving, or old age had made them blind or otherwise incapable of driving, or perhaps they lived in Manhattan.  At any rate it seems like about five percent of the households do not have vehicles for non economic reasons, which means that about three percent or probably less do not have vehicles for economic reasons.  Compare this with about fifteen percent that did not have vehicles for economic reasons in say 1970.  All of the numbers are very rough but you get the point.<br/><br/>The economy has been growing much faster than the official figures so the present generation is much better than one before.<br/><br/>You claim that we are on the edge of social unrest, but that is simply not happening.  <br/><br/><a href=\"http://richleebruce.com\" title=\"richleebruce.com\" target=\"_blank\">richleebruce.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 40}, {"assetID": 2565919, "replies": [], "lft": 38, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/opinion/26herbert.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3598454, "rgt": 39, "userDisplayName": "Meredith", "createDate": "1301110401", "userID": 28617892, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1301117252", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1301113652", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "Your statistics on our grossly skewed wealth distribution are astounding for a modern society with universal voting!

Therefore every year in which he is audited, after its completion the IRS agrees with Trunp's taxable income or loss. Also, if you utilize an NOL in a future tax year the IRS can adjust that NOL even though the return in which it was generated is closed due to the statute of limitations. Therefore, even though this may have been an aggressive opinion after an audit the IRS has agreed that Trump has paid the appropriate amount of taxes due under the law.<br/>4) tax laws change every year. The research and development tax credit was just last year finally made permanent. Before that it had to be extended by congress every year. The point is if his position was allowable on the law in 1993 there is nothing illegal about it.

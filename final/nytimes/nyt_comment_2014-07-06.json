Students, for example:  a party a majority of whose members claim not to believe in evolution is not likely to get a lot of traction on a college or university campus, where courses from astronomy to zoology kind of assume an understanding of the history of the earth and universe that is not found in the book of Genesis.

They may be openly gay or have close friends who are, even in college fraternities, something that would have been unthinkable in their parents' time on campus.<br/><br/>As to economic issues:  most students do work, all but trust fund types (many of whom probably vote Republican).

Contrast those with the perfect placements of the Dutch.  When you hit the side net on a penalty kick, it is essentially unstoppable regardless of the quality of the keeper.

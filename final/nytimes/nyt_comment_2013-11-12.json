The attendants there let you know that they are in charge and they expect compliance with their instructions, but they do so without being insulting. <br/><br/>There is a fairly simple rule for business conduct, whether on an airline or in other fields. If the price set by the business is 1 dollar or 10,000 dollars, the purchaser is entitled to decent, respectful treatment and full value for the service they purchased.

This matters not at all. To the flight attendants, I am just another problem. The attendants on AirTran seem to be the worst, waiting for the moment they can tell the passenger that he or she is doing something wrong. The TSA has rules against \"congregating\" near the forward restroom, but is one person a congregation? To AirTran, the answer is apparently yes. <br/><br/>It seems the American airlines industry has lost its way and they want to blame it all on the passenger.

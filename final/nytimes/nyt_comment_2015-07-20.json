The EU could grow its economy and be monetarily/financially more stable if they would adapt the US system and leapfrog their charter to be more like the maturing United States.  Even though we still have our problems in managing bubbles, we do have depositor guarantees in the banking system, &amp; pension guarantees, etc.  We have a few problems in managing our fiscal outlays for countercyclical safety net programs where some of our states don't treat their systems equally, but we are working on it.  But on the big things such as transfers from rich states to poor states, we do it anyhow because we value the union and its strength which seems to have an overall benefit.  Labor mobility, and eliminating rigid monetary standard rules are a necessity.  If the EU works toward a more perfect union, they should be and will be formidable in global trade.  Clearly they will be a strong competitor with the US, which if I remember correctly was a concern when it was first formed.  I don't really see why it should be too hard to adapt their system to our Federal Reserve system, I would only recommend that we reinstate the Glass-Steagall banking act.

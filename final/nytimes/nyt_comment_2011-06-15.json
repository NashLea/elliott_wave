Especially not feeling like I belong on this planet. <br/><br/>When I was in middle school, I dreamed an old woman in a dark cloak was stalking me with a harpoon, trying to kill me. When she finally succeeded, and all my classmates gathered around me to see why I'd fallen, the old woman glared up at my spirit, which was hovering over my body. \"Why?\" I demanded. \"Why did you kill me?\" \"Because you don't belong here,\" she spat self-righteously, as if she'd set the world back to its rightful order. <br/><br/>The thing about depression, while there are things we have in common, each depression is unique to its owner. When I was 13, I was so depressed I finally managed to summon the courage and ask my mother if I could see a professional counselor. \"Why would you need to do that?\" she asked, clearly bewildered. \"You can talk to me about anything any time.\" But I couldn't. My parents somehow managed to ignore me crying in my room every night, rocking back and forth on the floor and tearing at my hair. <br/><br/>In my early 20s, I couldn't take it anymore. I started hoarding strong medication, planning to take it when I had enough to do the job. But like another poster said, I realized that if I had the courage to end my life, I might have the courage to change it. I gave myself a year to try before committing to ending it all. <br/><br/>Everyone's way out is different. For me, it was painfully slow. Every day felt like unbearable work and zero reward. But I confronted the things I was afraid of, the thoughts that made me despair. For me, it was how awful the world was and the belief in hell. My family was religious. My mother's coping mechanism was to see no evil. My dad's was to believe that God would sort it all out afterward. Neither of those worked for me. Obviously, rejecting the notion of hell would put a rift between me and my family; continuing to accept the idea of hell would tear my brain apart. I couldn't believe in a God who could condemn half his own creation to an eternal lake of fire. It just didn't make any sense. I couldn't force my brain to accept something that felt like total nonsense. The paradox of a loving God and horrific eternal punishment was splitting my head. (It's that \"too much empathy\" thing.)<br/><br/>So I admitted to myself I didn't believe in that anymore. I didn't admit it to my family for a while, but I finally did. While it did create a rift, it didn't destroy our relationship as I'd dreaded. But even if it had, it would have been worth it. Forcing yourself to believe something you deep down don't is a recipe for disaster. <br/><br/>Another thing that helped me: I read books constantly. Fiction, nonfiction, books on depression, books about nothing but entertainment. I considered it \"my escape without dying.\" <br/><br/>The only thing I got from all the books on depression was that I could become more self-aware of my own thoughts and analyze them critically, imagining one of my friends was saying that to me. I slowly eliminated all thoughts of \"I'm so stupid\" and forced myself to rephrase them into something more specific, like, \"That was a bad idea that didn't work; I'd better try something else instead.\" Even rephrased, \"I wish I was dead,\" to \"No, I don't. I'll figure this out.\" Instead of endlessly berating myself, I gave myself pep talks. I tried to be a fan of mine instead of my own worst enemy. Even though we're all taught to be modest, I let myself congratulate myself when I did a good job. And no, lightning didn't strike me for being proud of myself once in a while. <br/><br/>Finally, and again this may only apply to me, I realized I was severely sleep deprived. Looking for a cure for my chronic sleepless nights, I realized I had delayed sleep phase syndrome. I can't seem to fall asleep before 2 a.m., which makes having a 9-5 job (or getting up for school all those years at 6:30 a.m.) very very tough. Once I found ways to get adequate sleep, my symptoms continued to improve. <br/><br/>I know depression and suicidal thoughts are different for everyone, and I DID think of suicide as a beautiful comforting thought for many many years, but I've been free of severe depression now for over seven years. (I'm 36 now.) I've promised myself I won't kill myself (short of having an incurable chronic illness) and this resolution makes me feel I will survive, and that I feel strong enough to TRUST myself to survive. <br/><br/>And honestly? I'm actually thankful I walked on the edge of the cliff and stared down to the bottom of the chasm. Suffering gives a special kind of depth and empathy. It makes me more sensitive to others and their pain. <br/><br/>If it helps to know, after revamping my life completely, I'm happily married, living in NYC, doing a job I barely dreamed I could ever have, and have had beautiful days of happiness, triumph, love, and optimism. There are still tough days that threaten to overwhelm me, but I know I can get through them if I wait them out.

I asked my husband \"what do we do now?\" I wasn't having contractions so he said \"we go back to sleep and call Miriam in the morning\" And we did....or at least I tried. In the morning Miriam assessed the situation and since I had no contractions she said \"we wait\". Waiting after your water has broken has become discouraged in the traditional medical model, and is an instant pass to an immediate induction. Miriam, however, was not especially concerned. So we waited. 36 hours later not much was happening so Miriam decided to get this show on the road and had me drink a disgusting blend of Castor Oil and orange juice. I was off to the races, from both ends! Contractions began almost immediately. Miriam instructed my husband when to call her. My mother and best girlfriend were helping. We had the lights dim and candles glowing. I moved around the apartment from spot to spot while I endured the contractions becoming ever more intense. Finally I asked my husband to call Miriam...I was ready. He wasn't sure that was the case, but don't worry, a laboring woman can explain things like no one else! \"CALL F*****G MIRIAM--NOW!!\" He called.<br/>\nMiriam asked to speak with me on the phone. She was able to tell by my voice and tone that I was ready and she came immediately. I was fully dilated. I labored for hours more until I didn't think I could push again. Miriam said \"Then don't, go back to contractions\". I had one more contraction and told Miriam I couldn't do that again. So she said, \"Then don't, push next time.\" I did, and our daughter was born. Miriam told me to reach down and pull my baby out. I put her on my chest and held her, exhausted but perfectly content. Later, when the placenta emerged I began to bleed excessively. Miriam handled it calmly; with an injection of Pitocin the problem was resolved.<br/>\nMy experience having my daughter at home was so empowering that I decided I too wanted to become a Midwife and help other women to regain this ability. Having our babies at home with midwives was the norm until the male dominated medical profession pathologized childbirth. Now we give birth to our children in a place relegated for acute illness and emergencies. We are totally detached from the process and have lost confidence in our own abilities.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2839887, "replies": [], "lft": 68, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/blaming-sprouts-again/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3995950, "rgt": 69, "userDisplayName": "anna", "createDate": "1308093564", "userID": 63489523, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1308111670", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new york", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1308108070", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "#28, 29<br/>\nMy \"yum\" is different from your \"yum\" (oh chocolate, oh cheese, oh rasberries, oh roasted chicken, oh ...).

Though this was over 16 years ago, not a day goes by that I don't remember her agony and suffering.  She couldn't move for the last year, couldn't open her eyes, couldn't speak.   Just a few years earlier she had been a vibrant middle aged teacher with her whole life ahead of her.  She had had tremors and her handwriting was bad, and occasionally she had the \"Parkinsonian mask,' and shuffle, but for a long while she could manage.  Then she declined.  Friends abandoned her, her brother declared it was 'too painful' to visit -- too painful for HIM.   Yet her mind was still intact up to the last minute.   <br/><br/>But worse than all she had to endure was the notion - which I read in this article - that somehow Parkinson's patients survive by 'grit and determination.'  The obvious corallary is that if you *don't* have grit and determination, you will suffer more and are in part responsible for your own illness.<br/><br/>I find this notion not only deluded, but repugnant, and I'm sorry I'm speaking so harshly, but it still hurts how the entire medical community let my mother down with denial and soft words.    I remember taking her to a Parkinson's support group and it was a giant room filled with normal-appearing people--that is, every one was in the early stages of the disease.  They all looked at my mother - in her wheelchair, unable to speak, the 'mask' very advanced - with fear and revulsion, and averted their eyes.  A few were openly hostile:  \"Are you SURE that's Parkinson's?\" one of them said, as though we were at fault for crashing the Parkinson's party.  The film that day was a muted sunshiny film of a grandmother - young, dignified, handsome - with Parkinson's, who was HAPPY, she said, that she had Parkinson's--It was a BLESSING, she said, because now it forced her to 'spend more time with her grandchildren and slow down.\"  To the backdrop of misty meadow flowers, two giggly children on swings and a golden sun - I kid you not - she declared how she now was blessed to be able to appreciate life 'every moment.\"<br/><br/>I was disgusted.  So was my mother.   We left. And we never returned to the 'support group.' Since the room was filled with those in the early stages, I'm sure we weren't the only ones to have been driven out of a 'help' group because we needed help and were in the way of others who wanted to believe they'd be fine with just 'grit and determination.'<br/><br/>Though vigorous denial has its proper place, it is of no help to those who need real help.  My mother was in PAIN.  Her doctors wouldn't even treat her properly because they were - yes - afraid she would 'get addicted.'   We never knew the course of the disease because no doctor would tell us.  When my mother had to have the heimlich performed on her for the second time, because she had choked on food again (her swallowing muscles were becoming uncoordinated) we saw her beloved regular doctor to ask for a referral for a feeding tube. He said, very bluntly - we were so angry then - that we should think twice before putting it in.  He said: \"Dying of starvation is far far easier than dying of Parkinson's.\"   In retrospect, he was quite right.  He was the only doctor to at least give us some warning to how bad it could be.  But we refused to believe him, as he was the only one to indicate that she could actually die from her disease, or suffer greatly, and so we put the feeding tube in.  She died two years later, much of it spent in suffering.  Of course she believed her life was worth the extra time, and so did we, but I wish we had made the decision with full knowledge rather than being badly mislead.  We would have done many things differently had we known how short her life was going to be and how much she suffered.  I would have insisted on stronger pain meds, for one. <br/><br/>You do no service to those patients who are in the earlier stages.  Telling them that others manage through 'grit' ignores the fact that the disease, while somewhat treatable, is erratic and unknowable, that side effects to medications are unpredictable and abundant, and that eventually, the disease is fatal.  The disease effects everyone differently, but articles like these do patients no service by pretending that miracles can happen with a positive attitude and the right combination of medicine.  Yes, some people last decades.  This is especially true if you have HEALTH INSURANCE (something this article hardly touches), and a full time loving caregiver (many people do not).<br/><br/>My mother did not last decades; her disease was rapid and brutal.  We were ill served then by the medical community, which wanted to react with denial and avoidance - since they in truth had no cure and doctors are very uncomfortable when they have no cure - and which refused to respect the needs of the patient and her caregivers.   Full honesty is critical.  Please respect the needs of all patients in your reporting.

Can we get some visionary and inspirational leadership? Probably not.<br/><br/>Dr. Bravata infers there is no long term data on the vascular health for those eating fat as a high percentage of their diet, but in fact, the data is immense. As recently as the 19th century and early 20th century, heart disease was rare and many of those diets were high fat. Also, there is not one credible study that links animal fat and heart disease. Thirdly, Americans are eating less and less fat but obesity is more and more rampant.<br/><br/>Why don't doctors warn patients about carbs. If sugar causes metabolic syndrome,  doesn't it make sense to warn people not to eat over 200 grams of carbs daily or at least talk about parameters. On a 2000 calorie diet at 40% carbs, your okay. It's when people in a misguided attempt go low fat to 10%, protein at 30%, and carbs at 60% that they fall into the weight gain abyss.<br/>\nAtkins, Paleo, South Beach and many others are sensible diets that will control weight gain as well as vegetarian diets properly constructed.<br/><br/>My prediction is that obesity and metabolic syndrome will collapse our health care system to a point that the private and public sectors will have no choice but to transfer more of the cost to individuals which could lead to better rates for healthy individuals and provide strong incentive for the unhealthy to become healthy.

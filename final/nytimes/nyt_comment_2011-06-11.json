Having become rather disenchanted with RBC theory in general I tend to find the explanation offered by Field more persuasive: that procyclicality results principally from demand shocks interacting with relatively constant capital services.

I have taught ninth grade for the past 12 years, and my most challenging classes lately are the ones in which boys far outnumber girls. The behavior issues are greatly magnified. I have talked to our school guidance counselor about this, but we are such a small school that it is difficult to balance classes in terms of gender, etc. I always feel sorry for the girls because most are quiet and don't want to speak up in front of the boys for a variety of reasons. I did have one girl who was an exception. She spoke up too much and too inappropriately. It was difficult to determine if she was trying to be \"one of the boys\" or if she was trying to appear older and more worldly. I would be concerned if my daughter of any age were one of two girls in a classroom whether it was an elective or a core class.", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Just look at their magazine. It talks about activities and places to retire that most people can't afford. I don't identify with it at all, but joined because their newsletter does have some interesting and informative things in it for people like me. I quit however, when they backed Medicare Part D. That plan is nothing but a scam and isn't much help at all. I got Medicare Part d because of mistake made on one of my prescriptions at the drug store. They charged me $93 for a generic cholesterol medication that really only cost $10. Before I found out the mistake, I joined. Now I am having a terrible time getting out of it. They have cheated and threatened me and I feel slapped in the face.<br/>\nAt one point they tried to charge me a $61 co-pay for meds that cost $11 out-of-pocket.<br/><br/>Now they want to cooperate with the conservative nitwits to lower Social Security benefits. If the Congress hadn't been robbing Social Security funds for years, there would be no problem. And why is everyone so scared of getting rid of the income limit? The whole system is rigged. <br/><br/>I am sick to death of our hypocritical government and organizations like AARP. We spend trillions of dollars on unnecessary wars and don't tax the rich and the corporations in any kind of progressive way. Everyone wants to finance the country off the backs of ordinary working people. I don't care what anybody says, we are a fascist state with no democracy left. Even Obama is a big letdown.", "recommendationCount": 5}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

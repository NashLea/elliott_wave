My response was in passing. <br/><br/>I am currently in the USA. I drove the PA Turnpike yesterday, where I saw multiple small solar farms occupying obviously arable land. Obviously somebody thinks this is a good thing. Germany has also taken similar measures. This is due to ill-advised incentives which make it more lucrative for a farmer to have solar panels installed vs. growing crops. Likewise, turning corn into ethanol to power vehicles will reduce the food produced and contribute to the increase in food prices (hurting the poorest people the hardest). <br/><br/>Solar PV on buildings can make sense, however. These need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Too often, the public hand blindly funds projects which never actually show a return on investment. <br/><br/>I applaud improvements in wind energy technology and support its use if the macro studies justify the same. But the explosion in wind turbine installations is causing multiple problems:<br/><br/>- noise vibration disturbance for those living working nearby<br/>- deaths to birds and bats<br/>- aesthetic footprint<br/>- absent battery technology, creation of power gaps and spikes<br/>- absent smart grid / new lines, power bottlenecks<br/>- drainage problems (foundation of deep cement required for towers)<br/>- removal costs (including return to original state) can be prohibitive. <br/><br/>Kurt in Switzerland"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10007564, "replies": [], "commentID": 10015101, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "b fagan", "createDate": "1379536791", "userID": 16045665, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1379557563", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "David B.

I've seen nothing published that indicates that increases in the persistent greenhouse gases will somehow NOT lead to increased greenhouse warming.<br/><br/>So, I think we should do the following:<br/>1 - go after the efficiency issues aggressively - cut down waste in everything.  Insulate and seal residences, manage power in larger buildings, continue with CAFE and EnergyStar -type regulations to drive manufacturers of consumer products.<br/><br/>2 - put a price on carbon.  Cap and trade worked here for sulfur emissions.   Price it and let the market help out.<br/><br/>3 - push energy storage R&amp;D aggressively.   There's a lot of interesting work that could minimize changes to our very messy grid with its &gt;500 owners. <br/><br/>As to the aesthetic qualities of turbines, I grew up near what was then the Esso/Exxon Bayway Refinery, and near the lovely petroleum storage facilities along the Arthur Kill.

However, owning Thursday night was not good enough for NBC and they pulled \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and \u201cNight Court\u201d from that line up, and switched them to another night.

I was a regular with his show in CA.  He is just not the same on prime time, and I don't care for the new informal format with him and the two chairs.  It is not working for me.   I like him the way he was on the Late Show!   Besides in the 10:00 pm slot he seems rushed and like its a low budget show.   Sorry, but that's my take on it.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1031538, "replies": [], "lft": 292, "assetURL": "http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/update-nbc-plans-leno-at-1130-conan-at-12/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1382295, "rgt": 293, "userDisplayName": "bayrider", "createDate": "1262916709", "userID": 6026220, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1262928492", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Cottonwood CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1262928492", "commentSequence": 132, "commentBody": "No No No NO!<br /><br />Jimmy Fallon is the best thing since Johnny Carson but we are already sleep deprived when he starts at 12:37.

But I know several parents in New York for whom space is an important consideration when planning a family.  The ways in which our kids are independent is vastly different as well.

The idea that we must either have inefficient, old fashioned family farms or industrialized, dehumanized, even savage, treatment of animals misstates the case.<br/><br/>SOME of the innovations of the last 80 yrs. in farming are good. Larger operations bring more production at lower cost, for example, than those that could be mounted by a single family (mom, dad and hard working kids). The choice isn't between a tiny, hand to mouth farm and a huge agri-business model. <br/><br/>The lone farmer and the agrarian society ideal from Jefferson's time could not endure. The farmer was often out of touch with modern methods and determined to stay that way. He lacked the capital necessary to change quickly and was at the complete mercy of the weather, diseases and huge market swings. <br/><br/>What we have now, however, is a looming disaster. Not only are chickens pumped full of drugs, they are raised in near total darkness to keep them eating around the clock. Sure, the meat produced is greater per bird, but it is often tough, barely edible.  As long as people buy it, the machine will keep running ever faster.<br/><br/>From what I have seen and read, I am left to conclude that our food supply has been hijacked by people who give no thought and care not one whit about our health. We have a perfect situation: they get rich, we get poisoned.

Because President Obama is wise enough to understand the Macro Dynamic at play here yet he chose to do nothing about it.<br/><br/>And what is that Macro Dynamic?  The conscious choice by certain elements of our society to Dumb Us Down... to orchestrate an Assault On Reason (as Al Gore called it is his masterful 2007 book by the same name... a book that received precious little attention at the time, because it wasn't about the environment)... and to use this assault to drive the American civic cultural conversation away from one based on Facts, Logic, and Emotional Honesty to one based on Lies, Illogic, and Ginned Up Emotions that are a product of those lies and illogic.<br/><br/>President Obama could have chosen to address the Intellectual Dishonesty that is running rampant throughout our society... like some insanity-producing disease manufactured in some secret laboratory of our enemies... but he didn't.  <br/><br/>How am I sure he knows about this and consciously chose to ignore it?  How do I know that, instead, he consciously chose to treat this disease as just an emotional phase people were going through that would pass?  Well, I mailed President Obama a copy of Al Gore's book and got a personally signed letter from President Obama thanking me for the gift.  (I know it was personally signed, because it came in a flat envelope protected from bending by cardboard even though it was just a one page letter.)  And I enclosed with the book my own essay describing this disease-of-the-mind for the threat that it is.<br/><br/>But rather than be America's \"Doctor-In-Chief\", President Obama has chosen to let his (and our) opponents continue to get away with behavior that threatens the very well being of our society by sentencing it to a many years' long period of \"10 year olds fighting in a school yard without bothering to learn the facts about what they're arguing about\" existence.  <br/><br/>This is why President Obama will be equally blamed.  While others are sick, he chose not to provide the cure.  While Reason was Assaulted, he chose not to come to its aide.<br/><br/>Shame on you, President Obama. I know it would be difficult to accuse the Tea Party of being out of touch with reality and in need of treatment.  I know it would be difficult to accuse certain powerful interests in our country of orchestrating this Assault on Reason.  But you wouldn't have to do it alone.  You could call on Al Gore... and the many, many professionals who could speak about this attack... this illness... this dumbing down of our society from positions of authority.  But you decided not to do so.  And we are all suffering the consequences of your decision.<br/><br/>But there is still time to turn this situation around.  There's still time to cure American of this disease... to stop the Assault on Reason.  Here's a link to my essay, which gets into what the cure is as well as talking about the disease in greater detail.  Maybe Al Gore will decide to start speaking about this again.

That means you can use your older Nikon, Canon, Leica or other lens. <br/><br/>Because of the size of the sensor the focal length of all your \"legacy lenses\" (as they're called) will be doubled. (It's called a 2x crop) A 50mm becomes a 100mm equivalent, 35mm = 70mm and so on. <br/><br/>Most must be used in manual mode, but it's a great way to use some of the old camera gear that's been stashed in a drawer or in back of a closet for the past decade!<br/><br/>Also, Panasonic makes several M4/3 cameras with built-in electronic viewfinders and articulated LCD screens that are only a bit larger and more like a traditional DSLR form factor. The flagship DMC-GH2 is MUCH smaller and weighs considerably less than low and mid range DSLRs with, arguably, comparable still and superior Full-HD image quality.<br/><br/>In-depth reviews from the Digital Photography Review web site. http;//www.dpreview,com<br/><br/>Panasonic GF2: <a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicDMCGF2/\" title=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicDMCGF2/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicDMCGF2/</a><br/>\nPanasonic GH2: <a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcgh2/\" title=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcgh2/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcgh2/</a><br/>\nOlympus E-PL2: <a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusepl2/\" title=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusepl2/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusepl2/</a>", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 2604743, "replies": [], "lft": 830, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/us/politics/07fiscal.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3653016, "rgt": 831, "userDisplayName": "LJPM", "createDate": "1302151698", "userID": 26502744, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1302151803", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Palo Alto, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1302148203", "commentSequence": 311, "commentBody": "Lock all three of them in the Capitol with no phone contact with the outside and no staff.

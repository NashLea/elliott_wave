On the one hand, the kind of \"Singular Intimacy\" of these \"Medical Stories from the Front Lines of DIsease\" requires some measure of credibility.  In other words, they need to be \"true and real\".  On the other hand, these stories need to avoid identifying the subject (as, let's say, a park ranger from Brooklyn with colon cancer, who speaks with lots of grammatical errors and wears a Yankees hat).  These stories also need soame measure of deniability; \"we've not told you the whole story in the interest of patient confidentiality\". I addition, in the words of response #58 the story needs to be sculpted \"for literary style and to hold to the reader's interest\".   \r<br/><br/>So where does this leave readers?  Wherever the writer leads them.  So, color me stupid, I am perfectly happy assuming that Dr. Ofri's clinical vignette evolved as written.  If it were fiction, why would her fiction stray from her own clinical opinions and standards?  But if this clinical anecdote IS fiction, what separates Dr. Ofri from James Frey in  \"A Million Little Pieces\"?  \r<br/><br/>So what it is it this?.

I wish we had  a little more participation from people inside India (7 of 31 makes only 23% - why did mother say I had no brain for statistics?). I am particularly thankful to NYT for providing this forum. I hope this was NOT just a storm in a teapot (coffee).Those who took the time to write must genuinely care about this subject (including \"endangered\" - though he/she don't have to feel so; India &amp; America may find themselves joined at the hips into the next century. This is quite important for us all). <br/><br/>With general elections coming up in India, \"globalization\" is likely to become a campaign issue. If neither Congress nor BJP gets enough votes to form absolute majority, they may be forced into unholy coalitions. And we have already seen what may happen in such coalitions - a few years ago, CPM almost sunk the Nuclear Cooperation Treaty between India &amp; US. I am not expressing any view whether it would have been better or worse; I am simply stating that even a small coalition member, when spirited enough, may force the majority to deviate from its policies.<br/><br/>If a pro-globalization party alligns with an anti-globalization party, the fate of India's market reform may be seriously affected - also causing an impact on US economy. This is NOT just idle talk; for the sake of argument, assume that as its potential future competitor in world economy, a foreign country wishes to (justifiably, in its own national interest) exert political influences over the direction of India's economic growth. It may then try to accomplish that through a political party sympathetic to its causes. <br/><br/>So those of us who have shown an interest in this serious topic, should contribute more; not just by offering theoratical opinions in NYT blogs, but by tangibly facilitating the success of our chosen political parties while remaining within the bounds of Indian election laws.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3285274, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/in-his-voice-there-is-peace/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4681095, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "Mohammad Zulifqar", "createDate": "1318389627", "userID": 50058839, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1318392348", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Sialkot City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1318388748", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "<br/>\nToday, we LOST ONE of the BEST Urdu GAZAL singer..<br/>\nAdami Adamin koo kia daaay ga Joo Be Daay Gaa KHUDA day Gaa..<br/>\nhe will be remember forever..\r", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

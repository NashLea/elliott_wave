Do you think that ending teacher tenure will help attract good, effective teachers to school districts where they receive no support and where they are paid less well than they would be in surrounding districts? As it stands, these are less desirable jobs already. You can't just get rid of ineffective teachers. You have to replace them with someone else.

There are other reasons, too, such as the fact that boys tend to learn verbal and fine motor skills slightly later than girls, and pushing them to learn to read and write the alphabet in pre-K is often setting them up for failure because they simply aren't ready.  A child who can't keep up figures out that he's a failure, and loses interest or acts out, which leads to more failure.  Many boys actually benefit from starting school a year later than girls.  Another factor is that schools have nearly eliminated physical activity by cutting recess and gym time, which gives boys no outlet for their energy, which leads to too many being diagnosed with ADHD and medicated when possibly the only medication they really need is the chance to run around more."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 19797419, "replies": [], "commentID": 19842543, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Elene Gusch, DOM", "createDate": "1474239679", "userID": 72350449, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1474305309", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "JK", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Albuquerque, NM", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1474301709", "commentSequence": 19842543, "commentBody": "Indeed.

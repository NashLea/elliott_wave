When you step back and consider that Trump's whole campaign is rooted in bigotry, anger, aggression, and tacit approval of violence, it becomes downright dangerous.  I'm no liberal, but you'd have to be a fool to think that Trump is merely calling for responsible monitoring of the polls.  This man's credibility is zero.  He has tried every sleazy measure he can think of to save him from what is shaping up to be a very embarrassing loss on November 8th.  I know people's partisan feelings shade their perception of things, and I am no fan of Hillary myself, but there is a point at which you need to set the politicking aside and recognize someone for what he is.  Donald Trump is an egomaniacal monster who would burn this country to the ground if it will spare him the humiliation coming toward him in three weeks.  Enough with the GOP posturing.  We all need to just come together and admit this whole election has been a black mark and move on.  I for one hope the GOP refocuses and brings back a candidate the caliber of Romney or McCain next time.  But this cause is lost.

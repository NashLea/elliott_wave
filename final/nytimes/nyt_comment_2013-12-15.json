Thank you, Professor Khan.  You (along with Professor Stiglitz) make me glad to be a Columbia alumnus.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of further thoughts.  First, perhaps the American prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s was also related to the fact that the rest of the industrialized world had self-destructed during WWII, and we had virtually no economic competition.  The Russian and Chinese dictatorships continued the tradition of our competitors shooting themselves in the foot until about 1990.  It was hard on the Russians and Chinese but great for us.<br/><br/>Also, statistical studies like the one by the Santa Fe Institute show that personal income is almost entirely determined by the financial position of one's parents.  For instance, aside from low income African Americans, education has no effect.  (Don't believe it? Read the paper, which is available on line.)  I would also like to see the evidence for the idea that most very rich people 'earned it themselves.'  I doubt it.<br/><br/>There is no good reason to hand the already rich huge tax advantages like low rates on unearned income (capital gains) and virtually zero taxes on inheritance ('step us basis') and no tax on stock sales (while sale of the family home involves huge transfer taxes).<br/><br/>I am running for president on the Comedy Party ticket.

I was shocked at how retro and conservative the parents were in terms of raising their daughters --it was 2001 yet in many ways it felt as if it were 1950.   Girls were expected to excel--excel-- academically, socially and morally. There was a huge amount of pressure and competition among parents to have what were viewed as 'good girls' and that was very narrowly defined.  Obedient, slender (NEVER overweight, never), rule-followers.   When my daughter was about mid-way through kindergarten, I realized that her teacher was really angry with her because my daughter hadn't mastered the skill of raising her hand to ask permission to speak.  The teacher was used to a classroom of girls competing to be the best good girl, and was clearly upset by my daughter's inability to stifle.  I realized pretty quickly that this pressure to develop the fa\u00e7ade of a perfect, self-contained, virginal princess was only going to increase, and we moved.  If it's true that parents become more conservative when they have daughters, it may not be for the best reasons, particularly if the trend is most noticeable among educated, affluent parents as the study suggests.

The Pope's emphasis on localism also suggests that wealth should be dispersed across broader geographies than is now the case, rather than concentrated key capital centers.  The Pope further calls for the rich to use their wealth to benefit the poor, which can be interpreted as support for socially responsible investment.  These are important messages.<br/><br/>The Pope asks that economic change be undertaken through the political realm. This suggests that the Pope supports governmental actions that reduce the gap between rich and poor, enhance the opportunities available to the least affluent and ensure that sufficient resources are available to all.  The Apostolic Exhortation is thus a direct challenge to laissez-faire capitalism and public policies that support it-- the dominant influences on governance over the past several decades.<br/><br/>I agree with Francis that new or modified economic and governmental paradigms are needed to blunt the sharp edge of market capitalism.

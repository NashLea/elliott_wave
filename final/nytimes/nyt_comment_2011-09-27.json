In name only, a right to a trial of our peers has become a thing of the past or a farce. Innocent people are coerced into guilty pleas out of sheer fear or ignorance. Public defenders are working for the prosecutors, not the individual, facilitating incarceration as quickly as possible. In reality they too are victims, with little pay, large case loads,limited resources to represent their client except in name only. Perhaps most of the people rammed through the system are guilty but to face a threat of life in prison or allow oneself to be bribed into pleading out is a great injustice for those who are not guilty or may have extenuating circumstances. \r<br/><br/>Access to civil courts is almost as bad.  Legislatures are capping awards, calling it \"tort reform\" so that people who have been a victim of negligence are greatly handicapped in obtaining legal representation. A blind cap by legislators who never sit in the court room or hear the case of someone harmed, leaves people with no legal voice at the mercy of deep pockets of insurance companies or manufacturers who bill attorneys by the hour to represent them, delaying cases to literally wear out the victim emotionally and financially. Without money you will suffer injustice both in criminal and civil courts in our capitialistic society that recognizes wealth as the only rite of passage. When people lose their freedoms, access to the courts, redistricting, forced photo ids, limiting access to vote, destruction of unions, bargaining rights, how far are we slipping from the freedoms outlined in our Constitution? As I hear the outcry in this nation to decentralize federal government I wonder if people realize that losing voice in government is the end of the line.

Purchasing power in turn is determined by how many price points there are (from very cheap to very expensive) for products and services. <br/><br/>The more price points in an economy, the better-off people are, especially those who were excluded by high prices in the past. India's economy is beginning to develop multiple price points across a variety of product lines, automobiles most notably. Car ownership has proliferated precisely because Indians of various means can now buy everything from inexpensive sub-compacts to Mercedes salons. <br/><br/>In July, a young man from rural Orissa who looked after a family member who lived alone, and I went to the City Center market in Salt Lake, Kolkata. He needed a pair of sandals. At the Bata store, their prices ranged from Rs. 259 to Rs. 799, that is about 8 days income to 25 days income @ Rs. 32/day. <br/><br/>Though still far from acceptable, this is far superior to the utter irrelevance of pricing and consumer goods for vast swathes of Indians in the 70s and 80s. My first transistor radio, a Phillips Philletta, bought c. 1975 set me back by about Rs. 450. I remember thinking that for millions of Indians at the time that was close to their annual income. Today, those same people have cell phones, TV sets, sometimes a fancy garment or two.<br/><br/>This is one instance of a very heartening change in the Indian consumer goods market. But subsistence products - food, sanitation, medicine and housing - still remain beyond the ken for too many of us in India. This is a failure of economic policy, conscience and the marketing imagination. I would even say that the basic marketing model in India is an American transplant, appropriate perhaps for the middle and upper reaches of Indian incomes, but devoid of any relevance to the needs of most of our people.

Indians tend to have this racial prejudice as an off shoot of the socio-cultural bigotry of the caste system. Indian social values promote caucasoid features and fair skin as being superior to non-caucasoid indigenous features and dark skin. There is a Sanskrit term for this bigotry and is called \"Samuthrika Lakshanam\" (meaning the \"Code of beauty and physical features\"). This racial and colour prejudice is reflected in the casting of actors and actresses in Bollywood Cinema. A few members of the upper castes may be darker skinned due to mixing of inter-caste blood in their genetic lineage, but skin colour is darker and physical features are non-caucasoid amongst the Dalits (peoples oppressed as untouchables) and indigenous tribes of India. One can find a few male actors in Tamil and Malayalam Cinema down South who are darker skinned in recent times, but even in South India fairer skinned actors are the norm. Even though South Indian peoples are generally more dark skinned, a sense of inferiority complex is instilled into the minds of dark skinned people of India by the socio-cultural norms. In India, fair skinned people are considered superior not only in terms of beauty but even \"superior\" intelligence is associated with fairer skinned and caucasoid peoples which is a direct result of caste bigotry. In Tamil cinema, Tamil speaking dark skinned actresses are usually shunned but ivory skinned women who cannot speak Tamil are imported from North India to act in Tamil movies and their screen voices are dubbed in Tamil by voice over artistes, and all this is done because the Tamil audience, though dark and black skinned themselves, are assumed to reject dark skinned actresses due to their own sense of inferiority towards their own skin colour. It is common to cast dark or black skinned people with indigenous features as villains, criminals and bad people in Indian Cinema. Plain racism.

Increase the figures - 1000%; 2000% even at 3000% Pakistan had fewer deaths than USA.<br/><br/>So, the point I am making is that the world needs to look at Pakistan through a different prism.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3281031, "replies": [], "lft": 42, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/manchester-city-and-financial-fair-play/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4592502, "rgt": 43, "userDisplayName": "Paul", "createDate": "1317097539", "userID": 34677113, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1317097665", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bellerose Terrace", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1317094065", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "@Phil Richards: You are wrong on several accounts about the Yankees. They have not always made money. When Steinbrenner bought the team in 1973 with a layout of $8 million of his father's money, they were not only on the precipice of bankruptcy, but they were going to bring the owner, CBS, with it.<br/>\nSteinbrenner made them profitable, but for many years since the inception of YES, their cable broadcast entity, Steinbrenner and his family have claimed in filings with MLB that they have LOST millions of dollars, right up to the present. Now, no one in their right mind believes that, but it brings up a couple of points relevant to financial fair play. Baseball, the only one of the five team sports in the US that does NOT regulate spending, has had more different champions than any other league (since 2001, there have been nine different champions in ten seasons; only the Red Sox have won more than once in that time span), perhaps in any sport in the world. But the Yankees claim to lose money, and do not have to report the income of the cable system that carries the vast majority of their games. You can be sure that YES makes money hand over fist. Like the suspect transaction cited about Man City between Sheik Mansour and his relatives who own Etihad Airways, it is very hard to point to where a financial transaction crosses the line into foul territory. While the Yankees use YES to hide profits, the soccer teams that own their own cable systems can do the OPPOSITE: operate the cable systems to subsidize the underlying team to make the revenue look greater than it might otherwise be, a loss leader, so to speak. By the way, Arsenal's cable unit broadcasts in this country on a delayed basis on, yep, the YES Network. Man United and Liverpool and presumably Chelsea have similar arrangements, all of which muddy the financial waters. The biggest issues in FFP are the broadcast rights in Italy and Spain which favor the big wildly, unlike in England, which IS fair in allocation.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3271932, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/a-small-sampling-of-anti-thatcher-songwriting/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4591926, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Larry Eisenberg", "createDate": "1317084404", "userID": 56166904, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1317134206", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1317130606", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Ms Thatcher in every song theme<br/>\nWas not well  beloved, t'would seem,<br/>\nA Reagan counterpart<br/>\nWith the same closed off heart,<br/>\nTea Parties with Thatcherites teem!", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3282264, "replies": [], "lft": 16, "assetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/wall-street-ties-bring-peril-for-democratic-lawmaker/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4592088, "rgt": 17, "userDisplayName": "matt", "createDate": "1317088441", "userID": 25978415, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1317134236", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1317130636", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "People should be angry...but not at lawmakers who actually have industry experience.

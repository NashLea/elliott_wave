A liberal Democratic administration, insisting that because everything in the faraway foreign war is going swimmingly we'll be packing up soon and leaving, thank you so very much, is slowly revealed to be clumsy realpolitik smoke blowers. Given that this administration is supposed to be the best and the brightest, it's a little awkward.

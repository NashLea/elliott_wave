Conversely, it is typical of believers that no amount of evidence contradicting their religion\u2019s tenets could change their minds. Ben Carson, a physician(!), believes the earth is 5,000 years old. There is no equivalent absurdity among atheists. Religion carries on despite conflicting evidence. It is religion that needs repair, not atheism.<br/><br/>If believers want peace and comity with people who beliefs diverge from theirs, they ought to stop trying to impose their beliefs on others.

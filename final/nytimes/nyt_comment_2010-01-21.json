To say that we are swinging left is based on the fact that the extreme right has darkened the poltical waters so much over the past decade or so.

Hopefully, they will wake up, connect the dots, and act decisively to anticipate and forestall any more events like that in the future. That many citizens of Massachusetts would chose to vote for the Republican shows (1) that they have a very short memory of the complete failures over the past 8 years of GOP dominance that brought us to our current sad state, (2) that instilling fear and hatred is still an effective tool for right-wing extremist politicians, and (3) that the Democrats are clueless.

The infrastructure of our entire country began to wear down and out because of a lack of maintenance. The lack of regulations led to the Saving and Loan scandal and a huge taxpayer bailout. We increased our military spending while we were borrowing money to avoid raising taxes to pay for government. We could do this and watch our productive economy shrink for the workers because we started out so wealthy and backed by foreign credit that we could pay for all the mistakes and not have to face a reckoning.

The Republican Party's owners - and so-called base.<br /><br />If Democrats start pointing this out loud and clear, most ordinary Americans will realize that it's the truth.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Democrats had better start getting RID of all the Republicans-in-all-but-name that they recruited in the last 10 years to become like the Republicans. Including the creeps from my state, who look exactly like the four idiots in the picture above: old, rich greedy white guys scrambling for lobbyists' money, out of touch with today's world, and utterly unwilling to do anything for the average unemployed people back home.

My friend signed up for the Jade TV after being told it was part of a certain package.  On the first bill she received, she was billed almost twice the agreed upon price.  Basically, the sales rep lied about what was included on the bundle.  With English being her second language, she was very frustrated by Direct TV's refusal to uphold the original agreement.  I was asked to help her talk with customer service to see if we could come to some sort of resolution.  After talking to a \"service\" rep  and escalating the phone call to a supervisor, I was told that even if the sales rep misrepresented the package, my friend was still on the hook for the contract.  So to lower her bill, she kept the Jade TV but switched to a lower plan.  She was also promised an extra discount that was good for 6 months and then she could request the extra discount to be extended for another 6 months.  Sufficed to say, every month, I would have to call the \"customer service\" because the various discounts were not properly applied.  I would first speak to a service rep, then to a supervisor who would promise to put back the discounts.  After 4 months of this, a supervisor finally refused to apply the credit.  The real frustration is that they would never send a written confirmation of what was agreed upon.  They supposedly documented every phone call and even gave us a confirmation number.  Yet every month, I would have to call and do my little song and dance.  Finally, I told my friend to write a letter to the FCC and to cc Direct TV.  An executive in the customer service department contacted my friend and as I recall basically offered 1/2 the agreed upon discounts and said that was all they were going to offer and if she did not like it, she could cancel the service but would still be responsible for the cancellation fee.  Well, my friend is no longer with Direct TV but is now with Comcast.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1076750, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/mold/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1447213, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "fivethirtyam", "createDate": "1264057054", "userID": 37484715, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264057509", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "connecticut", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264057509", "commentSequence": 10, "commentBody": "My problem for a long time was that I decoded the missing corner was \"don't get\", as in \"don't get personal\" and \"don't get fancy\".

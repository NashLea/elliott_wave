I believe that he has not stopped being that same community organizer to this day, only that his \"communities\" have gotten much larger. <br/><br/>In his speech to the Israeli audience he told them that the opportunities for change only begins once you have made the decision to do so. A commitment to make peace signals the beginning of hard work that lies ahead. A commitment that requires a large measure of hope to endure predictable setbacks and inevitable failures along the way.<br/><br/>This theme is exactly what Barack Obama has told the American people from the very first time he introduced himself. It is still exactly the same message that he conveys when he speaks to America.<br/><br/> We did not achieve the promises of hope and change when we elected Barack Obama as our president. The opportunity to reach those promises started on the day he was elected.<br/><br/>I am a proud American to see our president be so well received and to read the responses from these future leaders of Israel. The responsibility to effect those changes are not only on our political leaders, the bulk of that responsibility lies with the average citizens of our countries.<br/><br/>President Obama has always been quick to say, \"Ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\" This holds true not only in America but anywhere else around the world.", "recommendationCount": 31}, {"assetID": 3364458, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/22/world/middleeast/students-respond-obamas-speech.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8594996, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "LDK", "createDate": "1364008657", "userID": 57051727, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1364013562", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Vancouver", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1364009962", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Obama is stellar at speaking to and inspiring young people.

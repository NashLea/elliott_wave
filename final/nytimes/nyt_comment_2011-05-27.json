I\u2019ve tried several hotels in the latin quarter and saint germain area\u2026 with varying degrees of success! The Odeon Hotel is definitely the best, with a charming vintage decoration in good Parisian style. Everything looked so romantic to me (even the walk up to our room with exposed stone walls and wooden beams has delighted us)\u2026This boutique hotel is very clean and cosy, not huge and not too small. It is located in the trendy 6th arrondissement, surrounded by caf\u00e9 and restaurants, just a stone\u2019s throw from the Seine river, the Luxembourg Gardens and Saint Germain des pr\u00e9s!

When I started college, coming from the bottom fifth, it was possible to work one's way through school with a barely above minimum wage job.  That is rarely possible these days and cuts off a pathway out of the bottom fifth as well as many more in the bottom 60% based on income.  As Brooking's research indicates, forty-two percent of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of the income distribution remain in the bottom, while 39 percent born to parents in the top fifth remain at the top. Only 34% make more income and move up at least one quintile from their parents. The other 67% stay the same or decline.  Only 6 percent of children born to parents with family income at the bottom fifth and move to the top fifth. I was able to do this with educational opportunity, but as I note above, this is rarely possible these days and  the problem is getting worse, not better.  The household income at your birth now has a greater probability of your future success than your capabilities, no different than the class society of Downton Abbey.  In fact, the upward mobility in Britain with all its history of classes is now greater than a child born in the US.

First, most minimum wage workers produce far more than they are paid: a fast food worker generates more revenue for McDonald's than he or she costs. Second, the kind of work that minimum wage workers do is not easily outsourced. French fries can't be served via the internet. Lawns can't be mowed by robots. Office and hotel cleaning can't be shipped to Mexico. Well, companies can bring workers in from Mexico illegally and pay them minimum wage or less, but that's part of the reason that the wages paid for low-skill jobs are so low to begin with. Companies that claim that they can't find US workers to pick vegetables and process chicken are really just stating that the wages they offer are too low.", "recommendationCount": 39}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

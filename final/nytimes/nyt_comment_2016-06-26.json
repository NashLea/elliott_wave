He would be much safer than he would have been in his country of Honduras, and the language and culture are similar. Once an individual reaches a country that offers some relative safety, does he not then become something other than a refugee? Moving through Mexico and into the U.S., this individual becomes less and less a refugee, and more and more an individual seeking the better economic future that the U.S. offers. Mr. Kristof should be a bit more honest with the terms he throws around. No, we shouldn't be colluding with Mexico to help them with their problem.

After the 1960s and '70s, when comics \"grew up\" Marvel and DC both aimed at a more \"mature\" audience, with darker, more violent, more fetishistic and sexualized material, and they have lost the ability to connect with younger readers.  By younger, I mean kids who are five or six years old, and who can learn to read with comics (as I did) and grow up to buy them for a few years and either keep being nerd-fans or outgrow them. Nowadays the only entry point is basically for tween-to-teen boys (and a very few girls) but the mainstream comicbook world is pretty barren when it comes to little kids. The few titles they offer for this market tend to be jokey and self-referential (Tiny Titans) or of inconsistent quality (Billy Batson) and only one in a hundred are pure gold (Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures In The 8th Grade; Mary Jane Loves Spidey) and these tend to get canceled quickly.<br/><br/>As a parent who grew up reading comics and wants to share this imaginative medium with my kid, I've found it hard to find appropriate material, especially for a young *girl* to read. Although independent publishers have created some great one-off titles, the industry as a whole seems to have lost its ability to reach out to younger, more innocent readers, and can't help slathering on gratuitously violent \"realism\" or reflexive, tiresome irony. They have a tin ear for the kind of bold, simple, innocent verve that made the great books of the so-called \"Silver Age\" of comics so much fun to read. But continuing to print the same kind of stuff over and over, without layering their product to accommodate more than one kind of reader, will doom them in the end: too much of the same thing is, simply, boring. Like many older fans, I've drifted away from comics, but still cherish the medium, and wish it were easier to find books to recommend to other parents and kids.

There is nothing in this report that belongs in a democracy.<br/><br/>Bring down the banks! Reform them!  Cut them down to size!  Let the free market give them their richly deserved reward - failure - just as they have failed this country.  The ordinary people of the USA have too long been given the runaround by their profit-centered banking practices, such as limiting customer service phone calls to 10 minutes. What a travesty and an insult they are.<br/><br/>No American should support these banks any longer. If this is a free market, let's see it build a better mousetrap!  Warren Buffet makes himself look like a joke when he first claims that the super-rich like him should be doing more - then all he does is throw in with BofA.  How about coming up with a better system - one that supports and advances the wellbeing of the country, instead of looting it contemptuously for the enrichment of a psychopathic few??<br/><br/>Clearly, it's up to these few honest people of integrity, like AG Masto, and the American people as a whole, to root out the foul corruption that is US banking now.  END THEM ALL!  It's clear that nothing, not even their signatures on a settlement, can get these sociopath industries to heed the law, let alone the values and ideals of this country and the needs of its people.  End them all!

It fails to address a couple of critical issues. I currently work for an EADS supplier in Germany and have followed (more by personal interest than by work need) the development of the Superjet plane.<br/><br/>So, first issue: The soviet era planes are not a good reference. Those planes were designed and built utilizing only Russian suppliers. For the superjet Sukhoi is doing what Boeing and Airbus do, utilize an international network of hi-tech suppliers from more than 100 countries, including names like Honeywell, Raytheon,Thales, etc. For example, the Superjet avionics are the same used by the A380. Additionally, the soviet planes were not intended to meet international standards; in contrast, the superjet was designed from scratch for the international market, with the target to meet International standards and pursue certifications. <br/><br/>Second issue: In the competitive Aviation industry money talks. With one third the cost of competitive planes and 10% lower operating costs, airlines are listening carefully. Has more than 200 orders and at least one USA company (Willis Lease) has ordered six with an option to four more.<br/>\nSukhoi is not Embraer or Bombardier, is far a more technological advanced player. Boeing should not make the same denial mistake Ford and GM did with the Japanese competitors.

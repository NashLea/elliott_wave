Dr. Neal Barnard and other peer-reviewed scientists have long discussed the link between chocolate, cheese, meats and other products high in saturated fats with chemical-induced food addiction.  The Times should post revisions and future articles that include this research.

Same difference.  Probably northern Europeans and their descendants, with a long history of fat domestic animals and heavy-carb farm crops, are more resilient to the effects of fat up to a point.  Human beings are unable to manage themselves.  We've known for many years that obesity is bad for the health, and that healthy weight is a factor of exercise and diet.  But, because we are emotion-, rather than reason-, driven, we are helpless in so many ways, and poor diet is one of them.  From what I understand, police and others, like airlines security, don't like to search fat people.  The secret is substituting healthier for unhealthier choices, as dictated by circumstances, rather than abstaining entirely.  I like to drink, but I can't or don't want to quit; however, by restricting my drinking to the hours between 6 PM - and 9 PM, I can control the situation.  Not ideal, but realistic.

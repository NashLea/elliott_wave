Unlike Revkin, I stood beside Captain Cousteau as he opened a new marine science building at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School in 1973 and have had various contacts with the man, the legacy and the family since.  As the excellent biography by Brad Matsen \"The Sea King\" reveals, Cousteau led a double life, that of the sterling master of the seas, on board the vessel he seldom visited, presented to American television and film viewers, along with the hidden wife and family, and descendants fighting over and using the name and legacy before and after his death.  The wily Frenchman was a complicated man whose legacy of speaking out for preservation of nature and the ocean endures, despite his flaws.  His pulpit was based on America's perceptions, which he carefully nurtured and controlled, and in the end he did accomplish the raising of awareness that would probably have otherwise not occurred.  While today he is lauded for speaking out on ocean pollution and the plight of fisheries, his most important efforts, started during the last years of his life, were to point out the underlying role of overpopulation of the planet in every aspect of environmental problems and to warn of the consequences.  The root cause of nearly every environmental and many social problems, the explosion of human population, was not being addressed and he courageously tried to bring it to world attention.  He largely failed and today, in the world of conservative religious fanaticism and political correctness from many sides, population control is almost a forbidden subject.  If Cousteau should be properly remembered, he should be lauded for speaking out in his last years about this threat and made the focus of renewed efforts to stem (much like that oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, whose very existence is a result of the pressure of human population) the tide of human population growth.

This is a perfect example. If you are a climate alarmist, the government policies being proposed dictate the answer, otherwise known as policy-based evidence-making. If you are a scientist, the peer-reviewed literature has already provided the answer for a decade. The 'trick' is to convince the reviewers that the answer is not yet known.

This does not mean freedom FROM religion for everyone, as some would like it to mean, because freedom from religion as a chosen religious belief --the belief of the few with the most restrictive and intollerant belief system-- then becomes a forced freedom from religion enforced by the state, which is a direct violation of the very laws that those claiming the right to said enforcement often use in order to bring about this illegitimate enforcement.  If freedom FROM religion is a religious belief qualifying for protection under religious freedom laws, then all court cases attempting to wipe from public view all religions is a violation of the religious freedom of everyone who has a contradictory religious belief, no matter what that belief may be, because it sets as the preference of the state the beliefs system of those who choose freedom FROM religion.  Therefore the only way for freedom FROM religion cases to hold water is to determine freedom FROM religion to be a non-religious belief, in which case the \"religious freedom\" of those who lack religion cannot be infringed upon, as it is not religion in the first place, which invalidates pretty much every case.<br /><br />Religious intollerance cannot be addressed by a systematic religious oppression of everyone.  This idea that religions being suppressed will somehow improve anyone's life is nothing more than a modern man's crusade.

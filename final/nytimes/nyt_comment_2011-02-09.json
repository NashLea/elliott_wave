Nowadays with the rise of Biotech the distinction between science and engineering has blurred, which may confuse the issues.  There are shortages of engineers in many fields and there have been for a long time in some areas. There is also a shortage of doctors which has contributed to rising health care costs \u2014 fewer people consider medicine a desirable profession due to increasing hassles of the job. The engineering situation is similar in that many young people feel engineers are unhappy despite the good money.  In the area of software engineering the working environment has improved but here the low hanging fruit metaphor is a big factor \u2014 innovations in computer science are not moving well, perhaps due to business factors. Since the finance industry is both exciting and overpaying it is very attractive to the brightest young people. If this industry were better regulated perhaps some of the revenue could be redirected to areas which are currently in need of encouragement. Oftentimes the Chinese take the lead in industries because their government is supporting them better than ours is \u2014 and more generally innovation in engineering and computer software does help reduce costs to industry, so the situation is not just about lower wages or higher motivation for higher wages. Innovators *are* heroes in America especially those who create wealth and new popular experiences.<br /><br />I think I will buy and read this book.

It's very easy to cut costs if you take the health of the patient out of the occasion.  Think about how much we could save in social security and Medicare if life expectancy dropped by a few years.<br /><br />It's all well and good for employers like Safeway to see savings by shifting costs onto their employees, but how has it been for the employees?  Particlularly employees who have chronic conditions?  Have you considered the possibility that being responsible for one's health might mean being in increased contact with one's physician, not less?  Asthma, Juvenile diabetes, Crone's disease,  MS, high blood pressure can all be expensive illneses.<br /><br />I would like to suggest that the idea that healthy people getting too much healthcare and driving up costs is a myth.  The fact is, that hospitals and doctors make profits off of people getting routine care, and to some extent, doesn't that offset the costs of treating more expensive patients?  With the uninsured getting emergency room care, if hospitals end up shifting costs onto their paying patients, won't that drive up the cost for those patients?<br /><br />I agree that health insurance is not designed to deal with the unexpected, rare, and catastrophic event.  The fact is that \"catastrophic illness\" is not that rare at all, which is why health insurance is expensive.  Giving  healthy people money not to see the doctor via health savings accounts does nothing to offset the costs of people with serious medical expenses.<br /><br />If having more skin in the game makes people healthier, why is it that in countries with universal healthcare, and not nearly as much skin in the game as our 30+ million uninsured, are people so much healthier?  Could it be that having access to a doctor actually makes them healthier?  By your logic they would all be neglecting their health, because they aren't worried about healthcare costs. One would also think that the unhealthiest people in our country would be the ones with the best insurance policies.  But I believe, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that it is poorer people in this country, with less health insurance who are actually in worse shape.<br /><br />Saying that requiring people to pay more out of pocket strikes me as a convenient excuse to avoid having to fund healthcare adequately.  Kind of like when people like Andrew Carnegie rationalized not giving their employees weekends off, by claiming they would just spend the time getting drunk.<br /><br />Refusing to acknowledge that you treat some people shabbily and then blaming those people for self destructive behaviors appears to be the modus operandi of conservatives.  In Massachusetts, raising cigarette taxes lowered the percentage of smokers in all income groups except the lowest.  With the new Massachusetts healthcare plan, when these smokers were able to get into smoking cessation programs, more of them quit.<br /><br />Of course, if you point out cases where gov't works, then people will bash it for being a \"nanny state\".  Locking up mentally ill people for crimes is acceptable.  Giving people access to medical care and support services isn't.

I consider myself a progressive, which means I believe in the public good, not the pursuit of greed, and I believe government has a vital role in creating the public good.  That also means I am the nastiest critic and bean counter when it comes to effectively spending tax dollars to accomplish these purposes.  I have always advocated limiting what could be purchased with food stamps so as to maximize nutrition for expenditure, and I blame both the food industry and advocates for the right of the poor to eat as badly as the rich for waste (WIC is much better).  I tear our local \"economic development\" projects to shreds, because they don't have a means for assessing if the anything is accomplished, and I accuse both state and local governments of having an economic development bureaucracy with a vested interest in their own jobs that resists program evaluation (and a lot of special interests who benefit\u2014Brownfields have made welfare a way of life for developers).<br /><br />I seriously doubt a few test programs that use market-like incentives will have an impact.

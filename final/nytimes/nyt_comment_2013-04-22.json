We have heard the message regarding austerity vs stimulus a million times and simply repeating yourself further is a waste of ink. Instead, what the republic urgently needs is to get your advice regarding immigration reform. Truly earth shattering legislation has been proposed by the gang of eight in the  senate and if it passes our nation will be embarked on an irreversible trajectory into a mysterious future. Under the proposed law, legal immigration of both high tech and unskilled workers will vastly increase. In addition many million of illegal aliens will be given work permits to begin competing for jobs in the regular labor market. How will this legislation effect the economy and unemployment? Is it true that the new immigrants will stimulate demand and investment and reduce unemployment  (as some claim)? Alternatively, is it true that competition from the new immigrants make life even more difficult for those currently unemployed. Do we really need the new workers? The reform law is supported by president Obama and by a strange coalition including both labor unions and the chamber of commerce. Other politicians oppose the law and have been accused of racism and nativism. Please write a column explaining what you think of these matters.

Certainly Woody Allen would have the upper hand in convincing a tribunal of his innocence. He is brilliant after all. But, a decision not to charge is not an acquittal. And even an acquittal does not necessarily settle the argument. I once convicted a father of molesting his 4 year old daughter. The little girl took the stand and told a jury how her \"daddy used to make it rain in her bed.\" She was describing in child's terms her father's climax. Years later, she wrote me a letter thanking me. She wrote about how her older brother had come forward when he was 18, drug addicted, lost, in trouble with the law, to explain to his sister that he had been molested too. He felt responsible for letting it happen to her. I cannot tell you how many children slip through the system. I have interviewed so many child molesters who could look me in the eye and deny their crimes without a hint of remorse. I have spoken to priests who could deny their sins without batting an eye.

Sigh.<br /><br />More white squares ... in a daily NYT ...!  Feels like a stretch merely for the sake of a stretch, and what is the payoff? The \"and others\" crowd -- ERNIES, NEALES, ARLOS -- and the awkward plurals BILES and DRYROTS? Many clever clues to provide cover ... but, alas, ONE'S not feeling the love.

Sometimes I would be called to the exam room after an hour or 3 hour or more wait only to sit and wait some more. When I complained to his officemanager about the wait times she would say that they are working on reducing the wait time. Now we are all there to see a heart doctor...getting upset waiting for this guy not only would raise our blood pressures but would also increase the risk of having a possible heart attack right there. After complaining about the constant long waits ( I was there about once eevery 2 weeks) my wait times got longer so I demanded to see another doctor at the same clinic. I was given a new doctor who is wonderful and I am called exactly when my appointment time is. Since then I only have to see a doctor for my heart every 6 months..no more high blood pressure, and my heart no longer hurts every day. The doctor before the new one is just sending me a bill from Jan. 2009. I called to dispute it and told them I reufuse to pay because of all of the many hours he made me wait. He also would have me come in at 9 am and not see me untril 1pm or just send me home. It is a 90 minute trip to his office.  Could someone tell me how to handle this billing issue. I do not think I owe him anything. In fact I think he should pay me for the gas I used to get there, my hours of waiting time and for almost giving me a heart attack.

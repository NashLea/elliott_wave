Local responders need training not simply on how to deal with Ebola but how to identify those at risk and what specialists to contact if they have a question.  Ebola is probably not 'the big one\" for the US, but we will have a big one and when it hits we had better have the systems in place to deal with it.

You deny healthcare and Medicaid to millions of citizens in the red states that would cost the same states little or nothing.  With the compliance of a blind court majority that denies the existence of racism, every red state greeted that decision by establishing racist and exclusionary voting legislation designed to discourage certain citizens who generally vote left. The republicans support only their corporate masters epitomized by the Brothers Koch and Walmart which pays its employees so handsomely that they are forced to resort to food stamps and Medicaid. The majority of poor people in this country are women with children , the elderly, and the disabled. The myth that multitudes of able bodied people are on the dole is pure nonsense. And what would you do with the needy, Richard ? Finish them off by slow starvation and lack of medical care ? Shoot them ?

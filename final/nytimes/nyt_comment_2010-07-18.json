They align two wide receivers on the same side of the field and both run full-speed square-ins at exactly five yards.<br /><br />The Colts try to make the play look a little different to create a brief moment of hesitation for the defense. They'll run it from a number of formations, with different personnel, varying the wide receiver splits, or, as in this case, with pre-snap motion.<br /><br />They usually run it from a trips set with the tight end, Dallas Clark, on the same side of the two receivers, in the attached position (next to the offensive tackle). Clark will expand outside for two yards, then drive upfield and come across the middle at 15 yards. Manning will key the middle/inside linebacker. If the backer runs with Clark, he throws it to the slot receiver at five yards. If  he doesn't, Manning will throw it to the outside receiver at five yards.<br /><br />They rarely throw it to the tight end, the split end on the other side of the field, or the back swinging out of the backfield. It's a simple play that's been part of their base offense for years.<br /><br />This time, Austin Collie went in motion toward the ball, released, and made his break inside at five yards, at the 26 yard line. Wayne, however, made his cut at six yards, not five, at the 25 yard line. That one yard made all the difference. The precise timing required between the quarterback and the receiver was lost.<br /><br />Wayne appears to chop his feet at the break point. Sometimes this will freeze the defender and help him get open. It's an acceptable way to do it but it requires a split-second more time, and therefore allows the defensive back a greater opportunity to make a play on the ball. That's what appears to have happened here.<br /><br />The usual method of making a square cut to the right is to plant the left foot in the ground, bend the knees, sink the hips, and push-off hard in the direction of the break. The receiver should always maintain forward body lean and transfer his weight with a quick and powerful step. It takes hundreds of reps to master, as young receivers tend to round off the break or drift upfield.<br /><br />Tracy Porter's film study led him to quickly recognize the pattern and his anticipation put him in position to squat on the route, break on the ball, make the interception, and take off into history. All credit to him. However, if Wayne had made a clean square cut at the proper depth he would have crossed Porter's face and been in position to make the catch for the first down or, at minimum, to break up the play.<br /><br />There are many reason why a given play turns out the way it does. In this particular instance, a miscommunication wasn't one of them.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 1659191, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/google-buys-metaweb-to-improve-search-results/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2269027, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Statsguy", "createDate": "1279325497", "userID": 2863906, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1279431216", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boston", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1279427616", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Huh?<br />What's wrong with \"City Boston\" vs \"Band Boston\"?<br />How would anything or anyone know which one you're interested in, unless you specify?<br /><br />And what does it mean to understand \"relationships between things, like a band and its song lyrics\"?

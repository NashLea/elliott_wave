A similar problem exists with plug in electric cars. Yet alarmists have no problem making huge bets on technology that we know does not work.

I am a relative newcomer to this blog, but was wondering if you were ever taught any classical logic, of the Aristotelian sort, perhaps at Brown? And if you were, did you ever come across the concept of \"begging the question\"? This is where you assume as an undisputed premise the very conclusion that is in dispute.<br />Scientists learn during their training how to \"self correct\". We often make mistakes in formal logic, but when we lay them out, our ear is tuned for logical error. So we catch ourselves. In part, we do so because we know that if we do not, someone else will do it for us.<br />In the four weeks that I have been reading your blog, I have counted 18 times where your headline has \"begged the question.\" Just like this one today. The title \"On the Causes of Climate Deadlock\" begs the question.<br />The question at issue is whether or not legislation should be passed to prevent human CO2 release, in part because the such legislation it based on a dispute as to whether the feedbacks that control Earth's temperature are amplifying (meaning that a small warming will lead to further warming) or damping. Further questions in dispute are whether CO2 is a major (or even significant) contributor to natural regulation of global temperature, whether human activity will overwhelm natural temperature regulation (which historically hasbeen damping),and whether ground-based measurement that suggest that the Earth has slightly warmed over the past 150 years are unduly influenced by local phenomenon. These are all open question.<br />Your title \"begs\" all of these, as it leaps past the question at issue, and claims that the interesting question is why that legislation has not already been passed. You seem to think that \"deadlock\" is a bad thing that we need to \"explain\". Had you not begged the question, you would have posed a more neutral title (\"Why has legislation based on the AGW hypothesis not passed Congress?\") Or had you begged the question in the opposite direction, you might have asked: \"Why is climate legislation still being considered?\"<br />Are you incapable of catching this kind of thing in your own writing? Or are you doing this deliberately to provoke those among your readers who understand logic and apply it in our daily activities?

I quote Yulsman: 'such an attempt at intimidation by a government official is pretty disturbing.'<br /><br />If he didn't say something similar regarding Hansen, he can go soak his head.\"<br /><br />I don't agree with Hansen either. Couple of differences though:<br /><br />First, somewhat minor; I don't think Hansen singled anyone out. (Maybe he did, I\u2019m not sure, but it seems like it\u2019s more general). He was speaking in generalities; he did not proscribe investigation and action on someone he disagreed with. And he was perhaps speaking in part as hyperbole.<br /><br />Far more troublingly, he is also not a sitting Senator with the power to actually launch investigations. And he was likely speaking in part as hyperbole. (I think Yulsman later made this point as well.)<br /><br />But there is yet another difference that is hard to quantify.<br /><br />HANSEN\u2019S VIEW ON THIS:  Taking tens of millions of years of built up greenhouse gases and releasing them into the atmosphere in a geologically instantaneous period of time, given the signs we have seen, and his (scientifically well supported) interpretation of them, and the underlying physics, and continuing to do it, is being wildly reckless with our kids and their kids\u2019 worlds, to the point of ridiculousness (or blindness?) almost.<br /><br />Of course, not as many have as clear feel for the actual science involved as Hansen-- though millions of viewers of fox and blogs such as watts up and the rest, almost comically and sadly, believe that they do -- and Hansen may be ascribing far more scientific knowledge and better information on the part of those whom he castigates than reality really warrants.<br /><br />INHOFE\u2019S POINT: The basic idea that radically increasing the atmospheric levels of ghg to levels well above any the earth has seen in nearly a million years and very likely millions of years; when the greenhouse effect is known, basic science; when we have observed (for whatever it is worth) a warming trend -- if likely severely lagging, for reasons I have gone over in other comments; and which the great majority of the world's actual scientists who have studied this issue are greatly concerned about, is a hoax.<br /><br />See the difference?<br /><br />None of these differences make Hansen right (in my estimation) or very helpful when he suggests this. But he is not a senator; he is not opening up investigations for what in the greater scheme of things are routine science errors (if that) and prejudices (if that) in any other science context; and he is a well respected scientist who has been studying this issue -- and largely been accurate on it -- for over thirty years, who is looking at the blatant misinformation (and probably in his mind, abject foolishness) of the assertions and accusations being hurled about, and is, likely, frustrated.<br /><br />A commenter above (Mike M) talks about the again private emails of some scientists showing their increasing frustration at all the misinformation and misrepresentations out there as an example of how we can't have a civil dialogue, but misses the point of the enormous misinformation and constant and often ridiculously misleading and unfair pilloring of scientists as individuals and as a whole -- and how this is also not helping us arrive at any informed thinking or decisions on this matter, but just the opposite:<br /><br />Which may well be exactly what Inhofe wants, which is exactly why those who have convinced themselves that climate change is not a big deal now simply continue to attack the science, and thus perpetuate this same misperception of the underlying issue.<br /><br /><a href=\"\u201d\">The relevance of this book</a> (which is not nearly as political as its title suggests) comes to mind.<br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1239297, "replies": [], "lft": 100, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/on-the-causes-of-climate-deadlock/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1676224, "rgt": 101, "userDisplayName": "augwhite", "createDate": "1268198211", "userID": 10990669, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268198903", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Houston, TX", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268198903", "commentSequence": 47, "commentBody": "Replying briefly to Ivan Carter's (#28) response.<br /><br />Ivan says \"Read my comments on this blog: Nothing is alarmist regarding the problem; all emphasize it is a big problem and give the objective basis as to why.

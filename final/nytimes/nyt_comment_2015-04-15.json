Our state had a very lenient policy for personal exemptions, but back then (early 80's) it was more about parents forgetting or just not being organized enough.  With a little nudge most parents (moms) would get their kids the shots.  But as the years went by, the school nurses became more interested in filling out the state forms than getting kids shots.  I was told to just have the parents fill out the personal exemption form so we would be in compliance.

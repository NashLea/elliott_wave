Lets briefly review reality.  First a hundred years ago when immigrants came here legally or illegally, the country needed them as the country was expanding and becoming industrialized.  Immigrants worked and made a life because they had no choice.  There were no government handouts to make it easier or to negate their desire to work.  This is now 2013 and it is a very different country, which so many immigrant advocates cant or don't want to understand.  Sure unfortuneately, we need a certain number as farm and service industry workers.  I say unfortuneately because no one else wants to do those jobs.  That aside, the immigrants we should welcome are those who are going to contribute something positive and constructive to the country.  Also I am getting bored with hearing about the small handful in silicon valley who are successful immigrants.  They are a tiny percentage.  The kind of immigrants we need and should welcome are scientists, technicians and other skilled workers, not those the government has to support.  The old addage of \"bring America your tired, poor and hungry\" is not and should not be valid today.  Unfortuneately, America can not be responsible for the many problems of less developed countries and their people.  We just can not afford it any more.  Thats a reality our politicians and others can't seem to face.  Of course many politicians simply want their vote.

All other elements were made in stars or by supernova explosions.  Our star is a seventh generation star.  The previous 6 generations were necessary for the elements heavier than lithium to be built up.  Since heavier elements were built by radiation processes, they were very radioactive when first made.  <br/><br/>Our planet was made of the debris of a supernova explosion that happened about 5 billion years ago.  The Earth has been decreasing in radioactivity ever since.  All elements heavier than iron were necessarily made by accretion of mostly neutrons but sometimes protons onto lighter nuclei.  Radioactive decays were necessary to bring these new nuclei into the realm of nuclear stability.  That is why all rocks are still radioactive.  The supernova made all radioactive elements including plutonium, cesium 137, etcetera.<br/><br/>Radiation also comes from outer space in the form of cosmic rays.  Cosmic rays come from supernovas that are very far away.  There will always be cosmic rays.<br/><br/>Again: 4 Billion years ago, the Earth was a lot more radioactive than it is today.

Although sports, including ones in which students compete individually, are organized around teams, athletic competitions create forums for individual success. It was Brandi Chastain, for example, and not her team, who scored the winning penalty kick in 1999. In fact, Chastain\u2019s reaction provides anecdotal evidence in support of the individual development approach and against the societal one. Rather than running to her team and hugging them in excitement, Chastain\u2019s first move was to drop to the grass, alone, and savor her individual victory. Her reactions is also consistent with our results: in defiance of traditional gender norms and societal expectations, Brandi Chastain took off her shirt, and, to the shock of many, exposed her bra to the world.\"<br/><br/>My takeaway of this study--high school girls that participate in competitive sports are more likely to act as they please, rather than as David Brooks would like them to act."}]}, "lft": 52, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/opinion/david-brooks-social-science-palooza-iv.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 12195054, "rgt": 57, "userDisplayName": "Arun", "createDate": "1404446572", "userID": 495283, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1404446589", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1404442989", "commentSequence": 12195054, "commentBody": "Read the Clarke &amp; Ayres article for yourself here: (PDF)<br/><a href=\"http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayers/12.6%20Chastain%20Effect%20with%20visuals.pdf\" title=\"http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayers/12.6%20Chastain%20Effect%20with%20visuals.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayers/12.6%20Chastain%20Effect%20with%20vis...</a><br/><br/>Their meaning of single mother is: \"woman has had a child and is currently divorced, separated, or has never been married\".

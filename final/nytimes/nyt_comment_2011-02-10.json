Nine years after this movie's 1959 beginning, I also took the train from Paris to the coast, a ferry across the English Channel (no 'Chunnel' then) to the white cliffs, and another train to London.  Aging conjurer Monsieur Tatischeff always seeks another venue for his old-style magic act, with most people preferring the new rock 'n' roll.  In one early scene the descending curtain hits the tall Tatischeff as he bows.  At an opera, Tatischeff gets to do his act literally after the fat lady sings.<br /><br />Post-London, Tatischeff takes train, boat, taxi, and another boat to a remote Scottish island, where he performs at a pub and guesthouse.  There late teenaged chambermaid Alice believes that his magic is real.  When Tatischeff leaves the island for Edinburgh, and Alice turns up as a stowaway on the ferry, sans ticket, the conjurer conjures up a ticket for her.  In Edinburgh they take up strictly platonic residence at Little Joe Hotel.  Alice has the bedroom (Tatischeff sleeps on the sofa) and becomes his surrogate daughter.  Tatischeff and Alice are kind to each other.  She keeps house and often feeds such other hotel residents as an almost suicidal clown and a drunk ventriloquist.  He takes other jobs to supplement his income and to buy her red shoes, a white coat, and then white heels that she admires.<br /><br />However, Alice meets a nice young man her own age, and we sense that the Tatischeff and Alice 'family' won't last forever.  I didn't care that much for the ending, but it did provide my title.  In essence, we should all enjoy life's simple pleasures and our own family, however defined, while we are still here.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 1483412, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/449735/Fair-Game/overview", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3358785, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "Lary9", "createDate": "1297237308", "userID": 59625289, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "The Puerile Hubris of an Imperial President", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1297314261", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1297314261", "commentSequence": 27, "commentBody": "Quoted from the A.O.

We did have to share the one full bathroom; the second one is a shower and toilet off the patio \u2013 convenient for coming back from the beach.  The location was a plus for us: we liked being in a quiet residential neighborhood away from the glitz of Poipu but only a ten-minute drive away at the peaceful 25mph speed limit. Parking near the beach was never a problem. The house is also walking distance to Old Koloa Town, which has its own charm and  convenient shops.  At one of these, the Koloa Fish Market, we bought wonderfully fresh opa (moonfish) steaks to bring back to the house for some of the best eating of our week.  We also got, for $8, excellent plate lunches, each featuring two good pieces of excellent fish.  These we brought back to the house and enjoyed on the patio.

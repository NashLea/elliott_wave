They are basically starting over, again, from scratch, to build a team full of solid complementary/role players to bolster the Amare-Melo-(perhaps)CPaul core.  Waiting for 'Melo to come to NY as a free agent would have been very risky, maybe impossible.  The Knicks had two realistic choices: (1) go the 2004 Pistons' route, let's say, with lots of solid, unselfish role players and old-fashioned teamwork (not how you build a dynasty, however: once they win a championship and become free agents, they all depart for the highest bidder); (2) go the Lakers/Celtics/Heat route, with 3 superstars (and all the media hype and egos that go with them) at the core of the team.  They (Dolan, Isaiah, whomever) chose option #2.  If they get CPaul, in a few seasons things could get very, very interesting; however, knowing the Knicks' recent history (well, the last 15-20 years) of trades and deals, etc., it may well go bust.  They need a legit center.  Even with A-M-CP (IF they get CP) as NY's \"Big Three,\" they still don't have a real center.  As a long-suffering Knicks' fan, however, I would say this about this latest mega-deal: let's sit tight, give them some time to build a great team, and work toward bringing Chris Paul to NY.

But Melo was afraid that changes to max salary deals, team salary caps, and the possibility of an NFL-style \"franchise tag\" would preclude him from getting the $ that he is getting in this deal.  Reason #2 - because Melo wants his $, he would not go to free agency.  Several reports stated that Melo would have agreed to sign with the Nets if trade talks with the Knicks failed.

I teach at a liberal-arts college- I came out of a # 1 humanities program, with degrees from a top liberal arts school, an Ivy and a major private non-Ivy and I make $50,000. Not bad-- I didn't get into this for the money--but consider that I have $60,000 in student loan debt and that I was in school for all of my 20s so I could become a college professor. (And I got lucky and actually got a job.)<br />I teach because I love the kids, I love the exchange of ideas, and I love my subject. I didn't get into it for the money-- but i went to school just as long as a medical doctor, longer than a lawyer, and I will never approach their income.<br />But that is okay to me, as long as I do what I love and get paid and treated fairly. But please, please, disabuse yourself of that misguided notion that faculty are rolling in the bucks. We aren't. I live in a small apartment- make payments on a modest car that gets me to and fro and certainly do not take European vacations or wear designer clothes.  And I sure as hell don't work 30 hours- try 60-70 hour workweeks, with the actual teaching, office hours, grading, research, writing and all the other stuff I have to do combined.

They trotted out a black police captain as window-dressing, really, nothing more, but he managed to help diffuse an extremely tense situation--he even marched with the protestors at one point. But this was all after the police chief trotted out the tank, the machine guns, the tear gas, and the police in combat gear. The protestors are well aware that it was the police chief who has refused to release any police reports on the incident except for irrelevant videotape that showed the victim stealing a box of cigars, as if to prove Michael Brown was merely a thug who deserved to be gunned down, case closed.

This does not necessarily mean that they were the most effective. The best thing that ever happened to me in college was when a professor slapped me up side the head (metaphorically) and told me i could do better. I'm sure in my infinite 20-year old wisdom I found it worthwhile to excoriate him come ratings time...but he was right. The point is that ratings can be manipulated.<br/><br/>On research. The best professors relate their research to the classroom. In fact, I challenge students to take my current ideas and make them better. Universities have two missions: knowledge creation and knowledge dissemination. Remove the former, you won't long have the latter. But both are inseparably intertwined. <br/><br/>On ratings. if you want to find a great college I suggest you take your kids on the road. Sit in on a class. Talk to other students. Talk to your friends. Drop by the professor's office (surprisingly few do). At my university there are super-smart people with incredible ideas who are passionate about young people (I wish I could take their classes!). Find them! You can try to quantify this if you wish, but I suggest you go find out for yourself. That's what I plan to do with my children.

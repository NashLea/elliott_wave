When I had my kids I promised myself they would eat a balanced, nutritious diet and would not be picky eaters.  We don't add sugar to anything, only purchase whole, unprocessed foods, and my favorite foods in the world are vegetables. And yet here I was two days ago -- we met a friend for a picnic with delicious Iranian foods such as yogurt dip, a bean and pasta soup, cucumbers, tomatoes -- and my older son only ate the pita. The creeping accommodations to picky eaters, the fact that my husband cooks 3 of the dinners each week and rarely prepares a veggie side, combined with the fact that veggies take more time to prepare, have meant that 5 days out of 7, we don't even have a vegetable at the dinner table. The demoralizing feeling of making a nutritious lunch and having it come back completely eaten, or the fact that you can see your son's ribs -- these all skew you towards making the child favorites. It's not a deliberate decision -- it's just that there are about 30 food choices every week, and if you take the easy route a few times, it adds up and pretty soon you realize about 80 percent of your kid's diet is white flour.

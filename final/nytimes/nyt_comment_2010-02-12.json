I happen to know some of these people and they are not actively looking for work at all, and are happy to continue to get checks as long as they keep coming.<br /><br />It is obvious that Obama and the Democrat party would be happy to continue the checks as long as Congress will allow them to. By doing so you have another dependent class of Democrat voters but more importantly you don't have a large amount of people clamoring for jobs and putting political pressure on Washington to do something about it. If I am happily drawing unemployment what is the incentive to go out and look for a job? What if I get one and then get fired a month later?

It has been an utter disaster for anyone under the age of 65, and especially for America's children. Cost controls are politically difficult, so it doesn't have any. The result is a crushing tax and debt burden for under 65s, while the elderly benefit from an enormous wealth transfer from the rest of society. This is despite the fact that elderly Americans often have substantial equity in their homes and stock portfolios, the result of decades of rising house prices.<br /><br />Meanwhile young families have to pay the taxes for the program, as well as paying off college loans, make mortgage payments and pay for the expenses of raising kids. Medicare is a great example of what is wrong, and right, with socialised medicine. Yes Virginia, Medicare is socialism!<br /><br />It is very unfair for some people to get socialised medicine and not others. Either give it to everybody, or scrap the whole program altogether!<br /><br />And the Republican criticism of the Medicare cuts is a great example of how the Republican Party has totally abandoned its principals in search of power. There may be some things wrong with what the Democrats have proposed, but the attempt to control the cost of Medicare should be strongly supported by every small government conservative, as well as every American under the age of 65.", "recommendationCount": 146}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

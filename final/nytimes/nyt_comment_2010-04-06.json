This president has done nothing but weaken this country. He has singlehandedly weakened this nation. This president is now dictating to our enemies when and where we can use our advanced weapon systems. Next thing you know he is going to invite Castro and bin laden to share a beer in the Whitehouse. This president has to this point done almost nothing that I agree with. He has crippled the intelligence, (Closing Guantanamo and Mirandizing Terrorists.)  He is dictating how our we spend our money, well those of us that have money. (AkA Healthcare).<br /><br />This president has done everything to violate his oath of office. For those of you that don't remember it here it is. According to Article II section I of the Constitution of the United States:<br /><br />\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"<br /><br />Well Mr President, You have FAILED on the \"Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"<br /><br />You have pushed though a Healthcare bill that the American People didn't want, and not one of your Republication counterparts signed off on.  You have Destroyed the National Security of a once great nation. You need to be thrown out of office.<br /><br />Now before you believe I am inciting Violence I am purely not. There are many ways to act without violence. The constitution is a wonderful document for people like you. The constitution had preplanned actions for people like you that is why Article II section 3&amp;4 exists.<br /><br />Our founding fathers did not design the Constitution to be thrown aside when the mood suits you. They did not design the constitution to forgo checks and balances. The constitution of the United states was designed around checks and and balances of the executive branch.<br /><br />Our once great republic is quickly turning socialist and the only way to prevent that is for our Commander In Chief to do a 180 degrees u-turn on his polices.<br /><br />We have an Obligation in our next Election to get rid of OBAMA before he gets rid of our life as we know it. You can mark my words \"Our Country if it isn't already too late will change not for the better but for the worse in the next 4 years. Our unemployment is going to skyrocket, and only the wealthy will survive if things continue to proceed on their present path.\"<br /><br />We have all seen the movie 2012. Well the premise of that movie still exists. The Mayan Calendar ends in 2012 we all assume that that means that something drastic is going to happen in 2012. Some believe that it will be from God coming back to earth and punishing those that are unfaithful. I am beginning to believe that we will end up destroying ourselves. I am also beginning to believe that it will be due to our Commander and Chiefs Policies. We are allowing IRAN to get NUKES, call it what you want sanctions will not work. The dictator of IRAN see's us as weak and guess what for the first time WE ARE. If IRAN gets nukes then we could inadvertently start a nuclear arms race in the middle east and with us limiting our ability to use nukes that could allow our enemies to strike us first. This being said we all know what happened in Hiroshima and nagasaki if our enimies hit us with nukes first THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT TO ANIOLATE THEM. The nuclear weapon is a first strike weapon not a weapon that is designed to be used after the country has been hit already.<br /><br />Well I have had my say. I believe this president will be the end of our lives as we know it. It is all up to the American People wether they believe that this charade needs to continue. This president is a Wolf in Sheeps clothing and I just hope against hope that I am wrong with what I have said here.<br /><br />So I say to republicans and democrats alike, we have got to get rid of this president as he is a virus and that virus is spreading faster than we can create antibiotics to fight.<br /><br />2012 DO IT AT THE BALLOT BOX.", "recommendationCount": 20}, {"assetID": 1332730, "replies": [], "lft": 1006, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/world/06arms.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1806206, "rgt": 1007, "userDisplayName": "Karen L", "createDate": "1270524890", "userID": 60277686, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270526454", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "St Paul, MN", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270522854", "commentSequence": 380, "commentBody": "The the term unilateral disarmament ring any bells.

Bush would have been hard pressed to press the nuclear button in case of a asymmetrical, unconventional war (which is the only way chemical and biological weapons will ever be used).<br /><br />The chance of a nuclear attack or counterattack by developed and civilized countries, like the USA, is very very low in any case.

No one knows.  The circumstances, the President\u2019s mental state, the advisers present, and the time allotted are some of the factors that will contribute to his decision.  These terms are just his opinion, anyway- they are in no way binding on future presidents, and while it may be informative to the public to know his thinking on these matters, it is pure conjecture.  The president\u2019s lack of experience under fire prevents him from drawing on experience, and confidently saying how he would likely react to a given set of circumstances.  The president is also mistaken that a nuclear strike would not be on par with a biological, or chemical strike.  Indeed, biological, or chemical weapons could, in the end, cause more casualties, and tie up more personnel than a conventional nuclear strike.  We cannot continue to play on an uneven playing field, where the terrorists develop dirty bombs, chemical, and biological weapons, and the president declares that we will respond with a grade of conventional response.  That reminds me of Vietnam, where you couldn't bomb near the Coke factory, and you couldn't cross certain invisible lines.  There are no invisible lines when charged with defending the nation.  Let me give you a little personal example, to help understand the practical implications of this policy, during wartime:  When we went into Iraq the first time, with General Schwarzkopf, President George H.W. Bush released an under the radar, but very public message that if Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against us, that he would respond with nuclear weapons, and Saddam could absolutely bank on it.  In addition to lifting moral tremendously, it gave us a tactical advantage of reigning in chemical Alli, who surely would have been extensively utilized after the elite brigade was wiped out, and the conventional forces started waving the red flag.  Another reason chemical Alli wasn't pressed into service is that George Sr. wisely disengaged without invading Baghdad, allowing Saddam to save some face, while achieving the goal of ousting him from Kuwait.  Wisdom, moderation, and patience were the hallmarks of our leadership in that confrontation. It is no coincidence that George H. W. Bush was a distinguished fighter pilot from the second world war- this experience honed his edge, and gave him the poise and confidence to make the right decisions in his future role as commander in chief, whereas his son, and this president don't have a clue.  I am sorry, but this president seems more interested in putting his scent on every facet of American culture than he is in bringing the country together with the modesty his election demanded of him.  America has become very self centered, and focused on instant gratification- traits that have caused us to become superficial, and it shows.", "recommendationCount": 11}, {"assetID": 1332730, "replies": [], "lft": 1026, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/world/06arms.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1806236, "rgt": 1027, "userDisplayName": "TB", "createDate": "1270525215", "userID": 54900537, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270526454", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Midwest, England", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270522854", "commentSequence": 388, "commentBody": "Did certain radio/television hosts tell there listeners/watchers to flood the NYT with paranoid comments or something?<br />This is surely a positive step and in line with his nuclear reduction strategy.<br />The idea that this makes you weak is so redundant.<br />Don't worry yourself you still have more then enough nukes to blow the world up a few times.<br />May we all sleep easy knowing that.<br />=]", "recommendationCount": 16}, {"assetID": 1332730, "replies": [], "lft": 1028, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/world/06arms.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1806237, "rgt": 1029, "userDisplayName": "Japhy Ryder", "createDate": "1270525248", "userID": 7383936, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270526454", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Arlington, VA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270522854", "commentSequence": 389, "commentBody": "Our President is incredibly naive.

I am outraged about what most of you seem to think here - how can educated people (you at least read the nytimes) still stick to this black and white pattern?!", "recommendationCount": 173}, {"assetID": 1332730, "replies": [], "lft": 1040, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/world/06arms.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1806258, "rgt": 1041, "userDisplayName": "Ed Dwulet", "createDate": "1270525462", "userID": 1502798, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270526454", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Los Altos, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270522854", "commentSequence": 395, "commentBody": "This policy is at least 60 years overdue and at that, it doesn't go far enough.

Anyone who knows that America is exceptional and our strong defensive posture is what has kept the world as safe as it is would be angered.  And yes, this does include a strong nuclear deterrent whether people like you like it or not.  I do know one thing, you may not like the means of safety and deterrence, but each one of you libs loves the blanket of freedom and protection it provides.  This freedom enables you and all of the other spineless libs to sit around and whine about \u201cirrational nationalistic arguments\u201d and the other terrible policies that keep you safe while you sip your chai tea and wax poetic about the likes of Che Geuvara at Starbucks.<br /><br />As far as supporting Obama, you're free to support whomever you want but if you are an adult and can't see what is going on with this guy there is no hope for you.<br />", "recommendationCount": 34}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

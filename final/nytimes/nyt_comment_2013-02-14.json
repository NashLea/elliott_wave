I consume 4 ounces of nuts each day , plus two tablespoons of ground flaxseed, plus two tablespoons of peanut butter and this alone amounts to almost 1000 calories.  I really do need to eat this many nuts, in order to get enough protein in my diet, since I don't eat meat and very, very little dairy and few eggs. Since I eat partly at work (food service in a nursing home) and I am not always able to eat beans everyday.   If I eat beans and rice, I eat about one cup of each of these and these with the sauces amounts to 600 calories.  Two big bananas that I may eat can amount to 300 calories.  I eat far fewer desserts than I used to eat and while I can stop eating chocolate once I start, I am beginning to be more concerned about the trans and saturated fats contained in them.  Monounsaturated and omega 3 fat is far healthier.  I have also stopped drinking diet sodas as well.   I really does take more than 1250 calories to get enough nutrition, except possibly if one eats a lot of non starchy vegetables.  On a near Vegan diet, it is very hard to get enough protein on that calorie level.   Even though 3500 calories sounds like a lot, it certainly isn't all that I would eat if I let myself go.

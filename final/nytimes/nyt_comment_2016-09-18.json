Those 12% maybe be just as smart as the students at the more elite schools, but they are far fewer in number, which makes an intellectual community an impossibility. Certainly schools like UMBC will have a bunch of motivated students who can basically do it all on their own. Kids like that can go anywhere. Schools like Cornell and Tufts and Haverford and Brown and great for very intelligent kids who are not fully committed to education. By being around other highly intelligent kids, those kids become more interested in intellectual development.

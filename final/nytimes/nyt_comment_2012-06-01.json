But seriously, it's not like he was all that great before the injury. Cherundolo is still the USA's most consistent player. Jermaine Jones, who was so effective against Scotland, showed why so many observers remain unconvinced. What was the point of that violent challenge on Neymar, on the sideline at the halfway line? By then the  ref had already made it clear he wasn't going to be cutting anyone any slack. This was just stupidity on Jones' part. But even more stupid was Klinsmann's comment about the USA needing \"to hurt people\". In that context, maybe Jones was just doing what he had been told to do by the coach. If that's the case, Klinsmann should be warned by his employer that that is unacceptable. You can be a tough and effective defender without going out to injure your opponent.

Convincing voters that this is their own fault, not those of political policies, ensures this downward spiral. <br/><br/>America explicitly contradicted the hereditary class system.

Six months later Bush signed into law a mini-stimulus of $150 billion, to avoid the massive cratering of demand all knew had to happen as a result of Bush moving $10 to $15 trillion (with a \"T\" from the demand side of our economy to the supply side). It was too little too late, and in September 2008 came the big one. The minimalist approach resulted in a 'stimulus' bill of nearly $800 billion, negated by $350 billion in tax cuts, and another $350 billion in reduced spending by government at the state level and minimal reforms for the banksters. The result was the problem never went away.  The Global economy and global civilization nearly fell into the the abyss. Perhaps saved so by so little as the 'cash for clunkers' program. In essence, the fall into the abyss was avoided, but nothing else was fixed or solved. What comes next is a gigantic fall off the ledge that the world has been clinging to.

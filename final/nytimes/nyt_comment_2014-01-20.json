We humans are witnessing a humanity-changing event of mega proportions.  <br/><br/>Burning fossil fuels and adding that energy to our fragile atmosphere is a science experiment that will cause great suffering in coming decades.  The only question is:  Can we do anything to stop the worst from happening?  And will humans try to offset it by geo-engineering? I hope I'm alive in 2050 to see how this story ends.

The more you earn per hour worked, the more tempting it is to work more hours and pocket the money.)<br /><br />Anyone who doubts this assertion can check out dozens of studies that confirm this. Here's an analysis of some of those studies that The Times printed in 2008: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/opinion/02conley.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nytimes.com...</a><br /><br />A much fuller account can be found in the write-up of this meta-analysis, which is sadly in pdf format: <a href=\"http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2006/wp0602.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bos.frb.org...</a><br /><br />But my main concern isn't the relationship between income and leisure. There's a more important point here.<br /><br />Blogs are a great place for people to express their opinions and to present factual data that the blogger missed, forgot or omitted. But there's no excuse in a moderated blog hosted by the world's most prestigious paper for false assertions of fact.<br /><br />Two comment writers have made simple assertions that are demonstrably false -- and wildly false at that. Indeed, the negative correlation between income and leisure is well enough known that I'd bet Catherine Rampell would have spotted the error immediately.<br /><br />That may be too much to ask for someone who moderates comments on many blogs rather than specializing in economics, but errors still have to be caught if these blogs are to be a place where readers get information rather than misinformation.<br /><br />Instead of rejecting erroneous comments outright, I think the paper should publish them, along with a polite response indicated that while X may be conventional wisdom, it is false.

We asked for at least the refund of her dinner expense but they only only offer a complimentary glass of champagne next she is there. The former general manager there even suggested that she should uses a strong insect repellent when she visit South East Asia.  My wife and I went to Bangkok, Tailand for 4 days, walking at day and night on the street in Bangkok and a remote city visiting a monk, and nothing happened.

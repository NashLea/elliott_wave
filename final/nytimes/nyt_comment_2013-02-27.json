What a nice change from the usual internet comment vitriol.  My story: Near our winter home in Florida, in a condo community, there lived a family of great horned owls.  I'd watched them for the last two years, male and female raising a family each year, gray fluffs that grew fast.  We saw them learning to fly, watched the parents bring food. Watched mostly grown son owl fly to a distant tree to sit with Dad owl.  Dad owl often sat out in the open on a light pole in late afternoon and would turn his head and look at us as we spoke to him. Sometimes he would hoot and I'd flatter myself that he was answering us.. Once, he flew within six feet by me from behind; he was being chased by mockingbirds (who relentlessly harassed him)/  Someone told me the family had been there for several years. Then this year, no owls; a big disappointment.  I miss these magnificent creatures whose lives I felt honored to peek into. I hope they found a more private place to live and are safe and happy.

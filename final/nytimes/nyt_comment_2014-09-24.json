The panic stricken reaction of the Saudi King was a revelation which has been recognized by fellow Arabs; his failure to see the danger posed to his regime while his country supported terrorists throughout the region which gave rise to 09/11/2001 had escaped his notice evidently. <br/><br/>Secretary Kerry has excelled, way beyond my expectations, in getting these Arab states to participate in the current action. The question is; will they stay involved? Will they recognize the danger posed to their regimes by ISIL and will their populations support those in power or see an opportunity to throw the current administrations overboard and become involved in either internal political disputes or civil wars within their own states?  In either case, the US must decline to take sides and let the various parties sort it out for themselves. The Arab-Muslim world is broken; look at the map from the Atlantic eastwards; the most stable Arab nation today is Egypt, and their stability is controlled by the military. Fortunately, the Muslim Brotherhood has lost power there. Turkey is the lone state supporting the Muslim Brotherhood at this time and they also admire the Hamas terrorists. <br/><br/>That Arab writers are now reporting the facts you quote is a departure from the past and would likely displease the rulers of the countries from which they come.

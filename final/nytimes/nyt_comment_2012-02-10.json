Oh, that's right!  This is CABLE TV, so the guidelines do not apply?  Or is it that the FCC does not monitor the amount of ads any more?<br/><br/>Then we get programs that make Jersey Shore look like intellectual fare, for example, American Stuffers and Lingerie Football.  I have to pay for all this junk along with the few channels that get regular watching, because Charter offers only bundles of their own choosing.  They cannot or will not offer any sort of a la carte pricing, for example at a dollar a channel a month.

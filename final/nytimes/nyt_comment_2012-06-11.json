This is one reason that strong companies like recessions: they rid the economy of competition, often that which competes on price rather than quality, making good quality more difficult to maintain for all. <br/><br/>Could it be that the Europeans, and many here, too, are trying to artificially generate this kind of a shakeout when, in fact, we don't need one, because the problem was mainly with the banks? Historically, economies have to go through down times before they start back up. That doesn't mean, however, that the historical pattern is, itself, an absolute requirement.  If the Europeans are, in fact, working to create those conditions, they are sadly mistaken, because economic cycles come round or leave, ready or not.  Man acts as best he can, but does not change the direction or timing of the wind or rain, in other words. <br/><br/>The idea that the US Fed. would hold off on expansion to avoid helping Obama is shocking. I recall, however, that the first president Bush was trying to push the economy back up in time for his reelection in 1992. He got very little help. He said he thought he would have been reelected if the vote were held two months later than it was.

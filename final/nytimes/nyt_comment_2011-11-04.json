To date, they've been conducted for perhaps 35 states over the past 15 or so years.  They provide a localized -- county-level -- cost of living for various configurations of families with heads of working age.  Offshoot studies in selected states provide (1) similar data for elderly people; and (2) counts of people whose incomes are below the SSS for their size/type of family in their particular county.<br/><br/>The most notable figure I've found in these studies -- among many others -- is one they don't directly calculate, but which one can calculate based on a simple assumption: the percentage of the children in the particular state who live in families whose income is insufficient to meet the most modestly defined needs (how is that for a euphemism?!).  <br/><br/>For the 4 states for which I've done the calculation, I've found that 40% of all children live in such families.  40%.<br/><br/>Take that figure in, and then think about its implications, for those children, for the classrooms they're in, for their teachers, for their classmates, and for America's future.<br/><br/>Martin Luther King said that a society that is designed to create beggars needs restructuring.  When 40% of our youngsters are growing up in families whose income is insufficient to meet basic needs, we're wrongly structured.<br/><br/>What are we to do about it?

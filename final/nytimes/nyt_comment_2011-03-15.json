He kept his talking points strictly in line with the results of current polling, which show most Americans want background checks for new gun buyers. But he was mute on Rep. Carolyn McCarthy's proposed legislation to limit the size of ammunition clips. Of course, this was a far cry from his campaign promise to renew the ban on assault weapons. He gave up on that pledge within a few months of taking office, once the NRA lobby received his undivided attention.<br /><br />If Obama had campaigned on a message of caution, we wouldn't be so disappointed with his increasingly flaccid performance. It seems he is simply biding his time until the 2012 elections. He seems to avoid taking a stand on any issue, at all costs.<br /><br />When we learned that his Organizing for America wing of the DNC was getting involved in the Wisconsin union demonstrations against Governor Walker, I rejoiced. I thought he was finally standing for something. Then came the news that an angry White House had reined in OFA, and barred it from participating in the fight for collective bargaining. Once again, I despaired.<br /><br />Some people have criticized me for criticizing Obama so much. They have accused me of siding with the Tea Partiers by refusing to give the president a pass on his slow and steady drift to the right. My answer is that Obama, despite calling his base sanctimonious purists and ideologues, also once said we should hold his feet to the fire when we disagree with him. So I am taking him at his word.<br /><br />Maybe if more members of his own party would be a little less timid, he might change. But I doubt it. The idealism of his campaign and the near-reactionary conservatism of his presidency have served only to cancel each other out and to create a vacuum of epic proportions.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com</a>/", "recommendationCount": 351}, {"assetID": 2518311, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/opinion/15brooks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3530741, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "JM", "createDate": "1300152757", "userID": 63235854, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300180543", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NV", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300176943", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Obama is not qualified for his present position.

Many Obama supporters in 2008 believe that to be true.  He campaigned as a card-carrying Progressive.  After the election he moved to the Center, slightly left. Now, mired in Afghanistan and terrorized by the Right, he has decided that being  Republican-lite fits his needs quite well.<br /><br />If Wisconsin Democrats start \"cleaning house,\" and it looks like there is a groundswell of support for more liberal ideas, I am sure Obama will agree.  If thisroves true, he will return more to 2008 mode since that will look like a winner!<br /><br />This is our problem--and not just with Obama.  We have politicians running our country today who do not stand for anything--other than their own ambitions.  And our 4th estate.  Yikes!  Except  for the alternative press, they are bought off wussies. Yep, welcome to America, the Corporation--playing at your local White House, Congress and--let us not forget--Supreme Court.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 500}, {"assetID": 2518311, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/opinion/15brooks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3530801, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Marie Burns", "createDate": "1300154267", "userID": 4461145, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300180543", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300176943", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "Oh, President Obama has been \"adjusting\" all along. We have not seen Candidate Obama since November 4, 2008. The guy in the White House is Bush III. Today he was \"winning the future\" with a plea to Republicans to tweak Bush's \"No Child Left\" policy.<br /><br />Friday he was backing enhanced prisoner abuse, supporting the gross mistreatment of accused WikiLeaker Bradley Manning. By Saturday Obama had arranged for the firing of P. J. Crowley, the State Department spokesman who had the courage to speak out against the abuse of Manning. (Crowley knows a little about prisoner abuse; his father was a POW.) Of course the treatment of Manning is completely consistent with Obama's other moves to incorporate or enhance the Bush terror suspect treatment. Last week Obama also reinstated Guantanamo military tribunals. I guess he sees this as a safe political bet since most Americans don't really care what happens to terror suspects. They would if by chance they became suspects themselves. But they can't imagine that.<br /><br />Obama makes Bush look like a wimp when it comes to prosecuting whistleblowers -- men and women who reveal instances where the government is engaged in wrongdoing. The Obama DOJ has brought more whistleblower charges than any other administration's DOJ. Ever. So much for Obama's vow of \"transparency.\" What? We get to see the White House visitor logs? Big whoop. In fact, many \"White House\" meetings with lobbyists have been moved off-campus to a building where the logs are not made public.<br /><br />In 2004, Senator Obama said, \"I think it's a scandal that this president [Bush] did not force a renewal of this assault weapons ban.\" So this Sunday, President Obama wrote an op-ed for the Tuscon, Arizona Daily Star in which he advocated for gun control. Well, okay, not exactly gun control. He said the states should do a better job utilizing &amp; enforcing existing laws requiring background checks. Assault weapons ban? Not word one. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has given President Obama a solid \"F\" -- a well-earned failing grade. But it must really please George Bush and the NRA.<br /><br />State Senator Obama opposed the Iraq War. President Obama escalated the Afghanistan War, which, by the time he did so, was just as unjustified as the Iraq War. Our reason for invading Afghanistan was to (1) oust the Al Qaeda &amp; (2) nab Osama Bin Laden. We've never done (2), but (1) was accomplished before the Afghanistan surge. And despite his rigging the election &amp; stealing billions of U.S. tax dollars, Hamid Karzai is still our puppet of choice. He just doesn't appreciate us as much as he did when Dubya installed him.<br /><br />The Affordable Care Act, the one that so riled the astroturfed tea party, is a copy of an old Republican plan.<br /><br />Obama's campaign promise to walk with unions was a sham. While teachers in Wisconsin were picketing, Obama was in Miami touting the \"reforms\" of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, an early and continuing advocate for crushing teacher's unions.<br /><br />The banksters are back in business, making the big bucks, gouging customers and cheating people whose homes are underwater. We can thank President Obama, Treasury Secretary Geithner &amp; Ben Bernanke (a Republican whom Obama renominated as Fed chair) for that. The much-touted Dodd-Frank financial \"reform\" bill is a sham. Meanwhile, President Obama is promising to \"ease regulations.\" Isn't that how we got into all this financial trouble in the first place?<br /><br />I could go on. But you get the picture. President Obama is not Bush Lite, as some liberals have charged. He is a robust Bush III, working hard to out-Bush the Bush family, father and sons.<br /><br />The Constant Weader at <a href=\"http://www.RealityChex.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RealityChex.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 592}, {"assetID": 2518311, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/opinion/15brooks.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3530826, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "Bob Sallamack", "createDate": "1300155001", "userID": 14440450, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300180543", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300176943", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "Prudence can sometimes look like weakness.

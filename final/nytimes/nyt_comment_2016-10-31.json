This is not just fair;  it is also good economics.  Students who have an easier path to graduation with fewer  financial obstacles will graduate in greater numbers and enter the workforce with better skills, in higher-paying jobs.  When they finish, they will not be burdened with loans, nor will they be paying a huge percentage of their income to send their own children to college.  They will therefore be able to save more for retirement and participate in the economy more.  Being better-off, they will pay more taxes and buy more cars, houses, vacations and everything else that makes our economy grow.

We learned that herders know how to manage the fragile eco-system.

There is indeed often a sudden dramatic increase in biomass when no animals graze. However, when drought occurs, the unpruned/overgrown plants cannot survive-too much energy into top growth,not root growth.   Any long term solution requires a delicate balance of land, carrying capacity and grazing animal pruning. We found a combination of goats and camels was most sustainable.<br/>Our experience with declining water tables- they were caused as much or more by mining than climate change. Trees that had survived for centuries, and were sacred sites, were dying because deep open pit mines pump out massive amounts of water, which is now polluted and runs across the surface of the desert adding to herder problems.<br/>We found some wonderful people working on the preservation of herder sustainable grazing practices and herder culture, both of which hold the solution for stabilizing deserts in Ningxia.

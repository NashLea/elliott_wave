Each of these universities, such as Binghamton, Albany, Buffalo, and Stony Brook have different cultures, different sets of courses and professors, and different foci in terms of areas of special interest.  Each of the colleges and universities have their programs and institutions influenced by the interests of the local communities, the local or regional geography,  as well as corporations that are located in their areas or regions.  The makeup of the student bodies also differs considerably across the SUNY spectrum.  For example, Binghamton attracts many foreign students from around the world because of its very major and well developed computer sciences infrastructure that was developed with substantial support, encouragement and input from IBM many decades ago.  Being a magnet for so many foreign students, the university also offers many programs and degrees related to international studies involving sociology, history and anthropology.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 1681447, "replies": [], "lft": 64, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/education/25suny-t.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2301621, "rgt": 65, "userDisplayName": "Larry Figdill", "createDate": "1280031496", "userID": 33947, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1280032004", "userTitle": "", "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "", "userLocation": "Charlottesville, VA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1280028404", "commentSequence": 29, "commentBody": "One issue that everyone seems to forget re flagship public schools is that the best ones are often located in what are usually considered very desirable places to live.

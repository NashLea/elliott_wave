We already do a million legal abortions, each and every year, and a good many of them apparently on late term babies (HEALTHY late term babies) and on healthy women, so that their fetuses can be sold for body parts and experiments."}]}, "lft": 330, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-our-sex-crazed-congress.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 15660537, "rgt": 337, "userDisplayName": "Linda", "createDate": "1438489414", "userID": 25141914, "replyCount": 3, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1438489446", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Oklahoma", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1438485846", "commentSequence": 15660537, "commentBody": "There won't be more abortions.

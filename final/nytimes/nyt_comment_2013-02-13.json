I do soak the coconuts for 10 mins in warm water to reduce the affects of the Sulphur preservative. Coconut chips are a so so substitute - but i find most chips including organic ones very dry and lacking the essential virgin oil.<br/>3) Good quality water, try to avoid fluoride <br/><br/>This has always helped me get back to work the next day with the same level of energy.

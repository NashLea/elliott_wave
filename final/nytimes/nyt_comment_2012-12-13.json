I can see that the work raises many questions, and does not negate the idea that comparing IQ scores between different age and societal groups is quite tricky, and the norms vary--requiring tests to be constantly re-standardized. Certain types of intelligence may improve more than others (i.e. verbal vs. analytical). From what I've read, Flynn is as much a political philosopher as a psychologist. This book may have a certain \"feel good\" effect, so we can perhaps pat ourselves on the back, but we probably shouldn't spend too much time congratulating ourselves. We are still fighting over some of the same political fiascoes as our Revolutionary Era ancestors. Based on another review, Flynn apparently cautions, \"...it would probably be better to say that we are more modern.\" He emphasizes that (some of us) see the world through \"scientific spectacles.\"Also there are a number of geographical variations that are difficult to explain.

In fact, they should be taxed at the same rate as the rest of us.  Unless you agree with Lincoln, in which case they should be taxed more.<br/><br/>Specifically, taxes on unearned income should be at least equal to taxes on earned income.  At present they are about half, so the rich pay about half the tax rate on their income that us middle class workaholics do.  <br/><br/>And this is despite the fact that most (80%) of their wealth is inherited.

When the raw images citizens take and post on Twitter and Instagram show more \"real\" pictures of what took place, it makes sense for people to look to these channels for information. Photojournalists have always presented an interpretation of reality by bringing their own perspective on life to the medium, but there needs be a line to what that should be. Their objective should be to inform the public, but this has shifted because heavily processed images tend to grab people's attention and therefore are deemed more successful. In a world where most every photojournalist is a freelancer and pretty images sell, you've got to join the crowd to stay competitive.

I'm not a professional photographer or anything... I'm High School student from Brazil. Regardless, I'd like to offer my perspective...<br/>Susan Sontag once wrote that \"a photograph can be treated as a narrowly selective transparency\". She goes on to say that \"In deciding how a picture should look, in preferring one exposure to another, photographers are always imposing standards on their subjects. Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are.\"<br/>So while I do understand World Press Photo's decision to disqualify submissions that were significantly post-processed, I would argue that the issue at hand is not of capturing what is true, but of having skill. Did the photographer under-expose the shot only to later 'fix' it in a photo-editing program? Did he/she capture a good image or did he/she 'make' a good image?", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3422079, "replies": [], "lft": 134, "assetURL": "http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 14162261, "rgt": 135, "userDisplayName": "wg", "createDate": "1424227975", "userID": 13111404, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1424236382", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Nyc", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1424236382", "commentSequence": 14162261, "commentBody": "It's about photography in context.

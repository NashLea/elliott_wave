My opinions....<br /><br />1) Like others here, I also think it was odd --- and \"flustery\" --- of Coach Chilly to throw Favre under the bus after the game (and again today). Pot, meet kettle. Brett played an uneven game but so did Childress coach a pretty uneven game. I was shocked that he (and/or the boys upstairs) didn't red-flag that Andrew Quarless TD that the Packers scored. His whole body landed beyond the live area of the endzone! Also, what was the point of giving up at the end of the 1st half? A Peterson run had the Vikings up around the 35-yard-line with 25 seconds left. What's the harm in heaving a bomb to that big WR he just brought in (Moss) or to Harvin or to Berrian? A catch, an interference call -- there was a chance to get into field goal range. Why give up? Yes, Favre got outsmarted by the Packers' D, but Childress got out-coached by McCarthy (who, with all due respect, isn't known as one of the NFL's keenest coaching minds).<br /><br />2) Before Childress jumps off a bridge over the loss, consider that this matchup was no gimme. The Packers were in a must-win mode, and the game was in Green Bay, and there was a big \"get-even\" motivation after getting swept by Minnesota last year. Yet the Vikings were in position to win at the end of the 4th quarter. It didn't work out, but that's no reason to start pushing panic buttons. The Vikes are one game behind the Packers and the Bears in the loss column.<br /><br />3) Kudos to the patchwork Packer defense, which had Favre looking more indecisive than what we're accustomed to. Gunslingers usually don't hesitate, but Brett had several moments where he didn't find the right receiver. That happens. It doesn't mean he should be drawn and quartered, or lynched, or even benched.<br /><br />4) I have a hard time understanding why Favre detractors are so full of venom. Man -- they talk like he's a despicable excuse for a human being --- an Adolf Hitler in football pads or something. Lighten up --- he's a football player who leaves it all on the field, and his 20-year career has provided tons of fun on the way to 500-plus TD passes, 70,000 yards, and 180-plus wins. I like what Bradley said in #6 above: Favre's play is \"addictive,\" even now. The game last night was real theater, with ups and downs all night long --- even within the last 45 seconds, when Vikings fans went from the elation of a game-winning TD to the extreme letdown of an overturned call.<br /><br />5) Given that Brett has two fractures in his ankle, I doubt we'll see him suit up next week (just my luck, living up here in New England!). With Favre, you never know for sure, but it seems like he'd need a miracle cure to play again even in two or three weeks, never mind in New England on Sunday. It's ironic that the franchise he led for 16 years is the one that appears to have ended his streak, don't you think?<br />", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 7479, "replies": [], "lft": 72, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/north-carolina/asheville/hotels.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3112221, "rgt": 73, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1288068679", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1288068679", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "userSuggestion", "updateDate": "1288138126", "commentSequence": 31, "commentBody": "Had a great fall weekend at the cedar crest last week.

If I extend my arm in front of me \"straight,\" it will not be the same as a man's arm doing the \"same\" thing.  Our lower arms are connected to our elbows differently than men's lower arms are connected.  I have no idea if this has an effect on overall arm strength or if it's simply an interesting difference with no noticable effect on strength or movement.<br/><br/>Historically, women had to do \"indoor\" things, often cooking with one hand and controlling a toddler or two with the other; if the cooking was over an open fire, controlling the little ones was very important.  At the same time, men had to track and hunt food, often killing the animal with a long spear; earlier in our history, a group of men would surround the animal and hope enough spears caused fatal damage to the  animal.  Studies of pre-historic graves find men with the same kind of breaks in their arms and upper bodies as rodeo \"clowns,\" who take a great many risks while the man who was riding the \"bucking\" bronco or bull gets behind the fence that controls the animals.<br/><br/>I've often wondered if women avoided getting close to an angry, violent animal because they were dealing with the babies, or if it was simply because they had better sense than the men of that tribe or village.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3349425, "replies": [], "lft": 2939, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/us/politics/after-benghazi-meeting-3-republicans-say-concerns-grow-over-rice.html", "parentID": 7745271, "commentID": 7745495, "rgt": 2940, "userDisplayName": "Jonathan", "createDate": "1354078752", "userID": 5930870, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1354080237", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Tucson", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1354080237", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Obama won the election by a good margin - isn't it his prerogative to have his choices accepted, and confirmed?

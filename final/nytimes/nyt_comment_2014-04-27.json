US gas can't get to Europe for ten years, the time it takes to build the infrastructure on both sides, and the ships.  Even then, the US would need to buy replacement gas, since we are a net importer, and would still be then.  All this would accomplish is to push US gas prices up to world prices, to the benefit only of gas companies.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russia's pipeline to China is near finished.  It may not carry it all, but in relative terms the Europeans would be in far more immediate and extreme hurt, and the US economy linked to them going down with them.<br/><br/>The Russians like the Middle East can't drink their oil, and they won't have to, because the rest of the world can't just burn its water.  That gas would find a market sooner than Europe would find gas to replace it, much sooner.  <br/><br/>This is no panacea for us.

Solidarity of course is not what comes out of northern Europe not just with regards to Greece but the rest of the bailout countries. For Germany and the other germanic tribes of the north Union means exploitation of the non-industrialized societies of southern Europe.  Undoubtedly Greece and especially the current Greek gvmt made mistakes, but Greece had economic crises in the past and several devaluations but never did it go thru anything even remotely similar to what is experiencing today. GDP: -25%, unemployed: 25%+, NO prospects of economic recovery. All these thanks to the brutal and heartless irresponsibility of the Germans. Any economist will tell you that austerity will never work in this case. Germany is one of the founders of the EZ fiasco yet it wants to assume no responsibility of the consequences of its obvious failure! When you take a country's sovereignity by taking away their ability to issue their own currency then yes, YOU - the powerful German- is responsible to take care of things when things go wrong.

The problems in this country are the result of 35 years of supply-side economics and the experiment has failed. The only free lunch was the one given from the middle class to the wealthy, you know the job creators, that took their tax cuts and created jobs all right - overseas. The American people have to ask themselves how did this happen - how is it that corporate profits are so high (see stock market) and deficits so large - maybe because the profits overseas were not invested back here or taxed? And then there is the subsidy of foreign investment operations known as the defense department which reduces their foreign investment risk. Those things have little to do with Keynesian economics, just plain old fashion greed, corruption and the impact on our middle class is clear to see. That is why aggregate demand hasn't driven up inflation because the middle class hasn't been paid for their productivity gains in decades.

Also, if you can buy guns you can also buy gun powder and ammunition and use the gun powder and ammunition to make a truly potent, deadly explosive.<br /><br />When the founders wrote the Constitution, the Second Amendment was added so the citizens could, as a last resort, run out a tyrant if one had taken over the democracy.

It was one of their common rhetorical devices used to show that the \"state\" was the wise leader because it didn't rush into things - such as change. Making it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain guns, ammunition and gun powder is common sense legislation we do need to rush into.

I would love to be able to choose what my taxes go for--every dollar. Perhaps we can start with something that our money is actually going towards right now, like our international wars or social security or government bailouts. As a deserving person (because I was born in the United States) I am entitled to such freedom of choice, que no?<br /><br />But back to health care and being worthy. If we stop giving out medical care to one group of people, like pregnant women who are citizens of another country, perhaps we'll get a huge tax refund. Maybe I'll use that money to go to Mexico. Women without visas or U.S. passports should not get health care because they do not deserve it. Does that mean that women who are citizens who currently do not have health care are being denied something they deserve? Are there some U.S. legal citizens that deserve health care more than others? Are there some people that deserve health care more than others? Seems to me like the people most immediately in need are the ones who should get healthcare, regardless of whether not we judge them as morally deserving. If a person is bleeding uncontrollably do they not derserve medical attention? I guess it depends on where they were born.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1434954, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/is-this-the-way-to-get-credit-to-small-businesses/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1950240, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "JAB", "createDate": "1273103291", "userID": 21383616, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1273120127", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Vermont", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1273116527", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "36%?

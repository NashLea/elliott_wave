As an ER doc death is usually immediate, and often we are now in the practice of bringing the family to the bedside if they wish to witness resuscitation.  This, although terrifying at first as an MD, often underlies what truly occurs when we fight death on behalf of the critically ill.  On the flip side, I have seen people with soon-to-be fatal conditions answer my question, 'you know you will die if I don't put this tube in, is that what you want?' with great dignity.  In that case, the family was also present, and the directness with which he said yes, and the directness of my question, with his daughters next to me, brought more dignity to his death than any euphamism ever would.  Death is brutish, smelly, and nasty; the road to dignity lies in witnessing this and rising above it with compassion and empathy.  I've never said 'passed'.

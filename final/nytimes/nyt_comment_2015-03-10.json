That gives the insurers another 2% to put toward overhead plus profits.<br/><br/>Although the theory was that the insurance companies were limited to 20% for profit and overhead, Obama decided that what he really meant was that the insurance companies were guaranteed 20% for profit and overhead.  So any insurance company that spends more than 80% will get a check from the taxpayers for the difference.  By the way, the Congress never appropriated the money, so it's illegal for Obama to give it away.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3423727, "replies": [], "lft": 97, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-faces-test-of-record-aiding-women.html", "parentID": 14355023, "commentID": 14364705, "rgt": 98, "userDisplayName": "pj taintz", "createDate": "1425958533", "userID": 69473632, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1425960790", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1425957191", "commentSequence": 14364705, "commentBody": "no, it shows that she is a calculating politician ", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3423727, "replies": [], "lft": 265, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-faces-test-of-record-aiding-women.html", "parentID": 14355265, "commentID": 14364712, "rgt": 266, "userDisplayName": "pj taintz", "createDate": "1425958604", "userID": 69473632, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1425960810", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1425957210", "commentSequence": 14364712, "commentBody": "BU BU BUT BUSH!!!! is old man, just because \"the other guys do it\" doesnt mean you should excuse your side. both sides should be ashamed of dealing with those countries.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3423727, "replies": [], "lft": 1125, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-faces-test-of-record-aiding-women.html", "parentID": 14361595, "commentID": 14364743, "rgt": 1126, "userDisplayName": "pj taintz", "createDate": "1425958952", "userID": 69473632, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1425960832", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1425957232", "commentSequence": 14364743, "commentBody": "sure, let me use that excuse on my taxes<br/><br/>\"sorry IRS&lt; I didnt bother with my taxes because there are to many forms and its too time consuming.\"", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3423764, "replies": [], "lft": 5124, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/world/asia/white-house-faults-gop-senators-letter-to-irans-leaders.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 14364910, "rgt": 5125, "userDisplayName": "Ann", "createDate": "1425960803", "userID": 31713359, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1425960846", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1425957246", "commentSequence": 14364910, "commentBody": "This seems to qualify as a hoax or a Hollywood-style wagging the dog, idea.

Can anyone explain why (since the 70s) a drop in real income seems to presage a recession.  The recession seems to kick in about half way down that decline.

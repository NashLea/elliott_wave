The Occupy movement is the strongest push for social change since the protests of the 1960s, which will scare both political parties (the Dems were the object and lost a Presidency in 1968, in spite of Lyndon Johnson's achievements in advancing civil rights). Unfortunately, this kind of activity can lead to over-reactions and violence. I hope that this time the level of violence will not reach that of the 1960s, when politically motivated violence was embodied in several assasinations, riots on campuses and in cities like Detroit, and deadly shootings at universities like Kent State.

This constant need to expand the military , to create new weapons systems based on imaginary bogeymen. This is the beginning of sabre-rattling  and does not serve the free world-or even the Communist Chinese world-- well. It is an artificial paranoia and a preparation of the minds and hearts of American citizens that the day may come when we need to do battle with China.  China is an old civilization and they have had their wars of conquest and unification. do they really hunger for another battle? I doubt it.<br/>\n  Anyone with just the basics of history will see that Western Europeans/Americans have had their years of trying to conquer the nations surrounding them and even further away. Why all of a sudden are we so concerned if China wants to try it's hand. Many have tried--not one has succeeded. Aren't we better off trying to live at peace with each other? Haven't the militaries of the world killed off enough people--mostly innocent? One has to hope that the Chinese people themselves are not interested in conquest--it is largely a \"government\" idea, that rarely represents the thought of the people.

There are, however, three key issues regarding this \"pivot\" toward Asia/Pacific. First, just because the U.S. now realizes that we \"wasted\" our time in the Middle East and Central Asia, and we want to pivot away from it, there is no guarantee that the situation will allow us to do that. With new developments in Iran, Syria, and Egypt, all signs point to more complications and intractable problems that will require more attention and resources. Second, U.S. would be better served by thinking more strategically about what message it wants to send to China, and how this message will be interpreted by the China government, the governments in Taipei, Hanoi, Tokyo, Jakarta, and Manila. Stationing Marines in Darwin and strutting about it could very easily result in unpredictable outcomes that can grow out of control. Smaller countries can be emboldened to provoke China, Tokyo might ask U.S. to reduce U.S. forces in Japan, radical Islamists could step up attracts in Philippines and Indonesia to stoke anti-American sentiments with China's tacit if passive approval. Certainly, the racial optics are all wrong--U.S. and  Australia, two white settler nations protecting their interests in Asia and the Pacific. Finally, just as Chinese government is changing leadership and the growing middle class is making ever greater demands for reform, this announcement gave the Chinese Communist Party a HUGE gift. The CCP and the People's Liberation Army will use this to rally Chinese citizens that, indeed, the Western world and their sycophants in East Asia will not stand for a strong and independent China.\r<br/><br/>Better approach would have been For the U.S. to take diplomatic leadership and bring China as one of many co-equals to work on maritime security, territorial disputes, and economic cooperation.

He further says that 3million independent voters are disenfranchised because of these rules. Bernie Sanders has under his charge millions of young voters - he has, imo, a responsibility to instill in them fair play and to accept rules and regulations, not to incite them otherwise. They are understandably disappointed and furious - that's where their mentor  should have stepped in.

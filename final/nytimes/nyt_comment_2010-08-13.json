The root cause of all these protests are because Islam cannot coexist with other faiths and this is part of worldwide Muslim brotherhood uprising fueled by Saudi Wahhabi extremists. You have completely ignored the sufferings of Kashmir Hindus who are the aboriginals of that land, who have been massacred and hounded out of Kashmir and now live in squalid conditions all over India. India has already experienced religion based partition, another partition on similar lines will leave a trail of destruction not seen in history before. Indian Muslims who account for 15% of the population will suffer immensely as the rest of the country will reject the concept of secularism and democracy.<br />The need of the hour is therefore is to completely integrate Kashmir in letter and spirit with the rest of the nation and let Indians from other parts settle in Kashmir.

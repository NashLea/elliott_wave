When contracts are let guaranteeing a certain level of profit, expenditures don't matter much. Moreover, if a contractor can layoff on the govt. a large portion of overhead and administrative costs, costs that he would have to pay anyway, that's all pure profit, even though it doesn't look like it on paper. <br/><br/>Contractors were hired to clean up after Katrina in 2005. The lead contractor was often paid 100 to 200 dollars an hour, but by the time it got down to the workers, they were lucky to get ten to twenty. Private contractors in Iraq made out better than bandits. (The Niagara of cash flowing to contractors here helped bring on the mortgage mess collapse.) When the Republican dream comes true, govt. will cost just as much or even a lot more, but the money will be flowing more reliably to their close friends.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 84}, {"assetID": 3379328, "replies": [], "lft": 35, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/10/opinion/blow-a-town-without-pity.html", "parentID": 9693698, "commentID": 9693880, "rgt": 36, "userDisplayName": "Rima Regas", "createDate": "1376108939", "userID": 52131820, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1376108946", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Mission Viejo, CA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1376105346", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "It sounds like your neck of the woods isn't any kinder than mine, David!

I agree that race should be taken out of the equation. Most of the comments that I have read in response to this story have been formed around race. The absolute truth is that no one has the right to judge anyone else. The root of the problem is the stereotypes held by some in one race about another race. It's all about perception people, some of you are supporting the stance that he asked for it because he dressed a certain way but what did his actions show? I also believe that some police officers indeed throw their power and use it in ways that are unjust. My definition of justice is that the punishment for any horrendous act towards another person(s) or property is equal to the crime. If you shoot an unarmed man you have committed some form of murder. If you have stolen from someone then you are thief and should be punished as such regardless of race. People should be judge by their actions only. Although this is not the thought process of our current society, the change starts with one. It's always easier to point out the should of, could of, would of's for others but its way harder to turn that mirror on yourself. Take a good look at your own prejudices and stereotypes and then put them to the test and see how many turn up empty and without proper cause.

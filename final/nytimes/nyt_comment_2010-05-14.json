Suddenly there was a massive explosion of vile brown material that knocked them to the ground. They picked themselves up and tried to compare notes. Two of them could only see the brown cloud.

The methane in the wellbore is very hot, probably over 300 F, but when the hot methane hits the cold sea water conditions are right for methane hydrate crystals to form.<br /><br />Obviously, the containment structure had to be full of sea water or it would not sink from the surface.  The hope was that the oil and methane would blow the sea water out of the structure through the outlet pipe. Then the stream of oil and methane could be capture in a pipe screwed onto the top of the containment structure, and brought to the surface.<br /><br />However, as I understand the commentators, and looking at the pictures, when the hydrates formed they plugged up the outlet pipe on the top of the device. Then more gas and hydrates filled the device until it became buoyant, like air trapped in an inverted dixie cup.  When the device became buoyant, it rose off the sea bed and, as the pictures show,  allowed escaping oil to flow out around its edges.<br /><br />Thus there was no reduction in the flow rate of the escaping oil.<br /><br />As for whether BP has any interest in capping the well, put yourself in their place.  The well maybe cost them $100 million to drill. So far they have spent $450 million on the capping and clean-up efforts. And every day the blow-out continues, the public watches BP execs being beaten over the head with two by fours, figuratively speaking, by congressmen with charges of negligence, incompetence and criminal stupidity.<br /><br />Meanwhile all the shyster lawyers in the lower 48 states are camped out in Holiday Inns across the Gulf Coast, signing up clients for the Mother of All Class-Action Lawsuits. The longer the blow-out continues, the more ammunition those legal vultures will have with which to eviscerate BP in court.<br /><br />According to press reports, the blow-out has so far cost BP $450 million.  That's $20 million per day in clean-up costs.  The well is blowing an estimated 5000 barrels per day.  Even if BP collects it all (which they are not) the oil is worth about $400,000 per day tops after they dewater it (can't sell crude oil with more than 2% water in it.)<br /><br />Now imagine that you are the president of BP America, or the CEO of BP International. Assume self-interest governs your every action.<br /><br /> Is it in your best interest to let that well blow, take the beatings on Washington and continue to spend $20 million per day on cleanup in hopes of skimming $400,000 per day of wet oil and maybe salvaging those few hundred thousand dollars worth of  steel casing already set in the hole?<br /><br />Or is it in your best interest to get your face and the corporate logo off the front page and out of the six o'clock news by capping that well any way possible, as soon as possible?

None of this will end up changing the lives of the poor. What do the common, everyday people know about class struggle? Nothing.<br /><br />Me: Well sister, Thaksin did give the poor one million baht per village. Perhaps he's a friend of the poor?<br /><br />Her: And everyone went out to buy cell phones, TVs and gamble the rest away. How did that alleviate the standard of living of the poor? He didn't even give his own money. He used the people's money to give to the people. And they loved him for it. All they know is, Thaksin gives us money, Abhisit doesn't - and that's that. That's why Abhisit has been trying to give handouts to so many people since he became prime minister.<br /><br />Me: If there's a general election, sister, do you think the Puea Thai party will win? Who will the Isan people vote for?<br /><br />Her: I don't know who will win, but the people will vote for whoever the nai (bosses or masters in the provinces) tell them to.<br /><br />Me: But wait a second sister, if this is a class struggle, why would the people vote blindly as the nai commands? Shouldn't they be struggling against the nai? Shouldn't they protest against the nai in their provinces?<br /><br />Her: You think people want to get killed? Besides, it's the nai who brought them to Bangkok to protest.<br /><br />Of course, there's always the rich and the poor in any society, especially one that follows the capitalist democracy model, however well or however poorly. But it's the culture of kowtowing, the nai and the prai (peasants) and the grossly disproportionate income distribution that make the ''double standards'' of Thailand unacceptable, at least to someone like me who is in search of the elusive ideal of ''equality''.

The kids don't even have proper books, clothes. But Abhisit gave us free education.<br /><br />Me: But sister, free or not, it's the same education we have been getting since forever.

Also, in this case you could probably think of the Red Shirts as the Tea Partiers rallying on the streets demanding Barack Obama to resign and call for an immediate general election.  If Americans can't accept this, why do we think Thais should?  The current government is a legitimate government.  The PM was elected by parliament members who had been elected by their representatives in the last general election.<br /><br />The matter of the fact is that the Thai government does not benefit from killing this rouge general. I suspect that ex-PM Thaksin ordered this person killed.  Mr. Thaksin knows exactly how to play this game and hype up western support and sympathy for the Red Shirts.<br /><br />Thai politics is very complex.  I understand it's not easy for international news readers to really understand what is going on in another country unless you know its history and follow its politics.  You need to be able to know the local language also.<br /><br />Most of the western reporters don't speak a local language, so they interpret news based on their own cultural understanding of what it is.  Many report news based on news patterns they learn in J-school -- good guys vs. bad guys.  There is a general assumption that Third World governments corrupt, so the poor tend to represent victims.

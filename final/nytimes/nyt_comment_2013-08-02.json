About half the moms don't work but nearly all are college educated, some had very successful professional careers before becoming stay-at-home moms. These are moms who are the most active in the PTA and volunteer a lot in classrooms. Whether or not they work outside the home, most of the moms are close to their children and care about their education and general well being. Are there still bratty kids and kids who just don't do well even with parents who actively volunteer? Sure. Kids will be kids, and abilities vary. But I believe most people will consider this a good school district.<br/><br/>Nita - what you experienced sound like parents in NYC or certain very affluent zip codes.<br/><br/>I believe you are both right. There are parents who handover care of children to nannies(even when moms don't work), overschedule their kids to death and expect them to achieve to satisfy their own ego, but I believe these are the minority(though it may seem like the majority in certain areas).

Instead of 70 outside readers, contracted to review 53,000 applications, and spending an average of 8 minutes per application, Yale used a large team of its own professors to read nearly 10,000 applications. Not only did each of us spent a great deal of time with each application (carefully reading letters of recommendation, student essays, etc.) but we then met in teams with the Dean of Admissions and various specialists to discuss--sometimes briefly, sometimes at great length--and to vote by secret ballot on each and every applicant. <br/><br/>I don't know if Yale still does things this way.  But while it was very labor intensive work by uncompensated professors, it worked.  The UC faculty is certainly large enough to do the same thing--if they are so inclined.", "recommendationCount": 10}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

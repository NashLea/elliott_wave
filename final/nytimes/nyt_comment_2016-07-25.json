Yet I have found the lack of clear boundaries between reportage, analysis and opinion very troubling. This is a situation that seems to be particularly acute during this heated political season.  I have no qualms about an editorial or opinion piece presenting a point of view, wherever it may be on the political spectrum\u2014that\u2019s  the rightful function of op-ed writing.  Articles clearly marked as \u2018analysis\u2019 also can be expected to contain an interpretation of data or a conclusion.<br/>However I have been concerned by the increasing amount of straight news articles\u2014those expected to simply present information based on observation and/documentable data\u2014that reflect the particular opinion of the reporter.  This is often done in subtle ways.  Inserting an adjective or two in a bland line of straight reportage certainly flavors the meaning of the text.  Unfortunately, there have been many articles (reportage, not analysis or opinion pieces) over the past months that left me in no doubt of the author\u2019s bias.<br/>However subtle it may be, bias doesn\u2019t belong in reporting.   I appreciate receiving news articles that present the unvarnished facts, fully and accurately reported, so that I can draw my own conclusions.  When I want analysis and opinion, I will go to articles that present these.   Why are these journalistic boundaries so blurred at the Times?

As I read your piece, I found myself nodding along in agreement with the points you make.It also struck me that a central point, that we still don't know Hillary Clinton,though she has been out there in plain view doing and advocating, and suffering  endless criticism,is also tied up with our generation of women working hard to make change, but not doing enough to claim credit for it.The younger generation has it all over on us, where claiming credit is concerned. I do feel that this failure to take credit has added to a lack of confidence in her. It's unfortunate &amp; undeserved.<br/><br/>I was first aware of Hillary Clinton in the 80s, as a young mother struggling to figure life out while working and raising small children. An article in Time Magazine about her, at that time first lady of Arkansas, was about how she was trying to change education in Arkansas, to bring up achievement and mastery levels in a state that was at the bottom of the rankings. I was so impressed by the fact that she was also a working attorney while First Lady, and really felt inspired by her. There were not that many high profile women in any domain during that era of the mid 80's. She gave me hope, working in highly male dominated field, as I was, that I, too, could succeed. I still have that magazine and the article. <br/><br/>I find myself feeling quite emotional at the prospect of her actual nomination for President. She has earned it. She deserves it.

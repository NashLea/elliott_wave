The largest of which I have data was the square-rigger France II, of 6255 tons displacement. <br/><br/>This is a minnow compared to any modern cargo ship. <br/><br/>A container ship of less than 100,000 tons displacement is simply uneconomical at present. <br/><br/>Very Large Crude Carriers, VLCC class oil tankers, routinely top 1,000,000 tons displacement these days. <br/><br/>Take pencil and paper and try to calculate how much sail area it would take to add even a fraction of a knot to the speed of such a monster. <br/><br/>Consider, too, that all such vessels now cruise at average speeds much higher than the average surface wind speeds on the ocean. All ocean sailers know that there is much more often too little wind than too much. Explain, please, how a ship going 30 knots is going to get drive out of an intermittent wind blowing  from 0 to 7 knots out of the wrong direction.  These are not skimming wind-surfers we are talking about but deep displacement ships.<br/><br/>I think your prediction, \"that sails will start reappearing on ocean-going ships as the cost of fuel goes up\" is not well founded in economics. Much more likely that, If the cost of fuel goes up, the cost of shipping cargo will go up to cover it.

But having read the research (and having had about $25,000 in student debt myself), I would say that $20,000 is not so much, from a purely economic standpoint, to prevent most people from getting a good start in life. It's not as if people need to repay that $20,000 quickly in most cases. And having a couple thousand dollars in annual debt payments is vastly preferable to not having a college education in today's economy."}]}, "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/upshot/the-reality-of-student-debt-is-different-from-the-cliches.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 12105784, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Jaime M", "createDate": "1403583113", "userID": 56257556, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1403583127", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1403579527", "commentSequence": 12105784, "commentBody": "In an allegedly upwardly mobile society, 20K in debt is plenty to stop someone on an average salary from being able to have emergency savings, open retirement accounts, and/or save to purchase property.

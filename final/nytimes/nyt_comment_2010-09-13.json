Democrats are now even afraid of the S word also known as Stimulus! But why? Just because Republicans are now against everything the Democrats stand for and the Republicans even use to stand for? Are the Democrats spineless? We know that the American economy can use another stimulus package, to help generate jobs in this jobless recovery. Another stimulus package geared toward public infrastructures renewals, expansions and rehabilitation. Why are Democrats now afraid to even mention Stimulus Package now? Oh, yes, Republicans spendthrifts during the last 8 years, are suddenly self advertised as deficit hawks and Democrats are suckered?<br /><br />Why can\u2019t Obama and the Democrats find the audacity to mock Republicans\u2019 wrongheaded prescriptions for the economy? Tax Cuts for the rich, the rich who currently, are not investing now and not hiring. Republicans prescribe, on the other hand, Freezes on Spending, and both prescriptions are silly, and are contrary to what most American economist recommend, particularly so, in view of the fact that the economic dire strait in America, was brought about by the Republican Party, with George W. Bush in the White House, the time Americans were plunged America this economic recession-depression.

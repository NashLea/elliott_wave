For a start, the United States is experiencing an alarming and unsustainable growth of international indebtedness. By the end of this year the country's net liability to the rest of the world will approach $14 trillion, and it is growing exponentially. At the current rate, liabilities will double again over the next five to seven years, taking the United States into banana republic territory. At some point foreigners will cease holding dollars and instead buy the alternative world currency-the euro. The dollar will crash and interest rates will jerk upward in response.<br />America's once proud culture of business building has given way to a culture of financial engineering, a doctrine of shareholder value maximization and a cult of the takeover. The game is to keep the share price up, and every sinew-of the organization is bent to that end; shortcuts are ever tempting, and inevitably some companies resort to straight fraud. Nevertheless, the conservative inclination is to overlook one or two bad apples like Enron and WorldCom and to celebrate the rule of America's capital markets. It is Wall Street constantly holding corporate managements to account that drives up productivity which created the current massive foreclosure crisis.  1 in 8 Americans are on food stamps.   And nearly 20% US homeowners are in or near foreclosure.   Is this prosperity?   False sense of superiority is extrmely harmful for our national well being.

In the case of New York Times, Mr. Friedman conveniently forgets Jayson Blair, who wrote over 600 articles for the NYT's many of which were shown to contain fabrications, errors and overt plagiarism.

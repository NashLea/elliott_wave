In Japan, the trains are clean and run on time and there is almost no crime. People are generally curteous, friendly, well-educated (K-12 education in Japan puts the U.S. to shame), trustworthy and trusting. Japan's good values, including about food, nutrition, consumption and the environment, should be a lesson to others. Life here is good, the way it should be.<br/><br/>The media has painted Japan with the brush of \"stagnation\" and the labeled the 1990s and even the 2000s as the \"lost decade,\" but Stiglitz is spot on. Maintaining the status quo from a point of stability, health high education, high employment, high personal savings and comfrot is something quite different from regression or maintenance of the status quo in a society that lacks all of the above.<br/><br/>In the U.S., the infrastructure is crumbling. Our electric grid desperately needs an upgrade. Bridges, tunnels, subways and sewer systems are old and falling apart. Millions of people go without effective access to healthcare (even after Obamacare). American ills include poverty, obescity, poor public education, lack of educational and economic opportunities, high crime, racial tensions, illegal drugs, societal distrust, and the constant stress associated with these ills. Japan isn't perfect by any means, but with a few exceptions the ills listed here are not a significant part of normal life here.

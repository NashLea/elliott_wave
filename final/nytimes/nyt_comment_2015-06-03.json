We obviously rely on many ongoing professional relationships throughout our lives, and if this were about an accountant, or, a better analog, a lawyer, there would be no objection.  For better or worse, I believe we still preserve a special status for emotional attachment and deep intimacy, hence the strict ethical boundaries.  <br/><br/>Perhaps our is a philosophical difference.  I believe that virtually every person who is on par emotionally as the author can learn to cope with life in a finite period of time.  The saying about th value of teaching a person to fish as opposed to simply giving them one is a close approximation. Emotional skills are still learned skills.

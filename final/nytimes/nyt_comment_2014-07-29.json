Most students that attend public universities can obtain scholarships and grants as good or better than Ivy league schools. My eldest daughter paid absolutely zero tuition for her bachelors at Madison AND her masters at Ann Arbor. Both were for academic merit regardless of income. Schools like MIT and Harvard boast \"higher proportion\" of students aid simply because the fact is that only the children of billionaires could ever afford to pay 250000 for a bachelors degree. That doesn't mean that those that receive aid are not having to incur crushing debt for the \"privileged\" of receiving an Ivy education. Even sillier is the fact when Ivy league schools need to fill their myriad of post graduate .student openings the \"selections\" goes straight out the windows since the openings far exceed the openings, thus being filled by students from all over the world. Even worse is their business schools MBA for which the most rigorous requirement seems to be the ability to pay. Under any close inspection, getting a degree from a much cheaper state institution with a good record is as valuable as one from any Ivy league. In my profession no one has ever asked about where I finished my undergraduate, studies, its just a data point in my resume four lines below where I did my professional training and my work experience.

All companies pay a small contribution, and the risk of bankruptcy is thus spread across all employees, rather than a few. Lately, between the overall decline of defined benefit plans, and ruthless gaming of the fund to advance corporate self-interest, the fund is (surprise!) underfunded. The problem is that our political system is very bad at protecting long-term interests of the politically disempowered when these conflict with the short-term interests of the highly empowered. <br/><br/>Many public defined benefit plans are constitutionally guaranteed in states, and states can't go bankrupt. But in the public sphere, there was also gaming -- often by public employers who chose to give exorbitant pension benefits to the more powerful unions (often at the expense of less powerful public employees), leading to underfunding as well. <br/><br/>Defined benefit plans sure aren't perfect. But one feature that they have, if properly established, is that they serve as insurance as well as savings: a good deal of risk that individuals face in defined contribution pension plans is turned into collective or even socialized risk.

One area to keep on eye on is the medical widget sold as a medical service.

Trouble is if their customers don't have access to the Internet it hardly seems reasonable to claim the company is putting 80% of its premiums towards medical care.

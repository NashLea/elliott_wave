I called my hospital, which was two hours away (in a big city with a NICU, unlike where I live), and they told me to go to the local hospital, so I did, through a flood, we were probably the last car through, and she was born at 6:53 to the hands of people I'd never met before.  All was well.<br/><br/>Oh, actually, my first daughter was born like that, too.  I had been seeing a midwife, but then five weeks before she was due, I suddenly developed very severe pre-eclampsia, so they transferred care that Thursday, of one of my pre-natal appointments, and she was induced starting Friday and finally arrived on Sunday.  I went through many shifts of doctors and nurses whom I had never met before.

But the specific argument about fitness level strikes me as a little disingenuous. Obviously, if fitness level were the overriding criterion for selection, the coaching staff could have simply had the players run through tests for aerobic capacity, and select the guys with the top marks. Any coach worth Klinsmann's salary, however, has to know that the process of putting together a winning team is vastly more complicated than that.<br/><br/>Donovan probably was not able to run the field for 90 minutes quite like those guys on the roster in their late teens and early 20s. (Nor, surely, were Davis, Dempsey, or Wondo . . . .) But there's never been any credible suggestion that he was dreadfully out of shape, or unfit to meet the competitive rigors of the tournament. And no one has argued that he should have been placed on the roster as a sentimental gesture. To the contrary, as many have rationally argued, Donovan offered a wealth of skills and experience that might have provided the team with playmaking and attacking flexibility to meet unexpected circumstances \u2014 such as the injury to Altidore.<br/><br/>Simplistic arguments that assert Donovan failed to meet some fitness standard superseding all other considerations smack of an attempt to evade what is, in the end, the undeniable strangeness of the decision to leave him off the squad.<br/><br/>\u2014 Brian"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 13025455, "replies": [], "commentID": 13028797, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "George", "createDate": "1413048839", "userID": 68849112, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1413049947", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Rollo", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "DC", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1413046347", "commentSequence": 13028797, "commentBody": "The same can be said for JK's performance.

Your knee-jerk reaction of viewing every critic of Israeli policy through an anti-Semitic prism exemplifies a major problem entrenched in the pro-Israel crowd, as it impedes your ability to reach out to the other side or view this conflict from any perspective other than yours. It is understandable though as decades of bloodshed has sowed deep suspicions on both sides, and erasing these hostile sentiments will take more than a generation. This is why the Rabbis' position reflects such tremendous courage.<br/><br/>My comment was an attempt to explain current attitudes that permeate the clerical establishment in Saudi Arabia, and was not an endorsement of their views. The fact that Jews are not going away is old news, the real Newsflash here is that global patience is receding, and Israel may not be left with any allies if its current policies continue. <br/><br/>Jewish presence was tolerated more than a century ago, otherwise Jews in the diaspora would not have considered emigrating from a hostile Europe to a more hostile neighborhood.

I read books about white children with intact families who lived near the sea, while I lived (and continue to live) near Long Island Sound.  I entered first grade a very fluent reader and writer, having only white main characters as my reading models and not much else.  In junior high school, I read Dante's Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradisio (more Europeans, but still very, very fascinating).  My reading skills clearly did not suffer as a result of this.  It wasn't until high school in the 1970's when I was exposed to Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston and other great African American writers.  I am currently a middle school English teacher, whose reluctant readers have become less reluctant because they seem to have some connections to the characters they read.  My students read the Blueford High series, Walter Dean Myers, Jacqueline Woodson, Gary Soto, Piri Thomas, and yes, Judy Blume, Rick Riordan, and Suzanne Collins.  I'm not quite sure what it takes to get our children reading more, but I'm not ready to give up just yet.  My personal love of reading is a tiny part of it, because I strive to make every book seem like an adventure ready to happen.   The current crop of literature has a ton (in my opinion) of multicultural writers, themes and characters.  It is up to parents, students, and educators to share them.", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

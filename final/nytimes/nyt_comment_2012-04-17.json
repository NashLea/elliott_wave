Since American business typically does not invest in extensive training (unlike the Germans) these industries depend on the JC to train these workers for these good paying jobs.

First of all, if this question (would you marry...) was posed to the unmarried, and many favored virginity for both men and women, then the respondents were themselves sexually inexperienced.

Our Western view is substantially the opposite: that, absent the opportunity to experience others when young, both men and women will wonder what they have been missing and will stray.  <br/><br/>A related Western belief is that one who is more experienced fully chooses his/her marital partner.  You do not mind driving a Toyota if you have never driven a Mercedes.  Having driven both, and others as well, you might very well prefer Toyota.  But you choose with full knowledge of what is available.<br/><br/>The male preference for female virginity was first rooted in being able to determine parentage of the offspring; DNA has solved this.  Now, it is the need to treat a woman as a possession instead of a person (someone else has touched your possession!), and the fear of not measuring up to other men.

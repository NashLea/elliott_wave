I was beginning to worry about her; to me the Republicans now resembled the most repulsive Dickensian characters. My husband asked if they had started waterboarding her yet. He's an Independent as well as a WWII buff; he said Rep. Jordan reminded him of Goebbels and that he was done with the Republicans. <br/><br/>When Hillary started coughing and Chairman Gowdy asked her if she wanted to take a \"60 second-two minute break\" I was so angry I burst into tears.

Even the amount that is coming from harvesting plantations is beind denied by the likes of Drax and their host governments. They try to pretend that it is all coming from residues or thinnings, but not the harvest of forests or plantations.  <br/><br/>There is a grain of truth in your storyline plantations could suck up the C emitted, but it could only be attributed to the energy use if the plantation were established for that purpose and on land that would otherwise not produce anything.  I.e. If the bioenergy use created that sink. But that is not the case.  The EU calculations essentially assign to the EU energy sector all the future carbon services of the US land concerned, even if the US will also lay claim to the regrowth (as their own sink).<br/><br/>And again, it is practically irrelevant to the EU's approach as essentially zero biomass is coming from new production created for this purpose. They are essentially saying that by virtue of harvesting an existin forest (plantation) to be burt, you can lay claim to the future carbon services of this land for eternity."}]}, "lft": 188, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/flawed-carbon-accounting-drives-boom-in-burning-u-s-forests-in-e-u-power-plants/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 16456078, "rgt": 199, "userDisplayName": "David B.

Here is the simplified argument:<br/><br/>Burning a unit of coal generates a unit of atmospheric CO2 which remains in the atmosphere for a long time.  See David Archer's \"The Long Thaw\".  I will take that time to be 50,000 years, just to simplify. <br/><br/>Assuming a well-run tree farm, the corresponding figure for burning biomass is 1.2--1.4 units of atmospheric CO2.  But the tree farm regrows, so the residence time for the CO2 is but, say, 50 years.<br/><br/>That is one thousand times smaller global warming potential.  That is so small I, along with the EU, will ignore the discount of the future.  So the EU has the rule about right.<br/><br/>There are other values to actual forests beyond mere tree farms.  There are many reasons not to cut down the forests.  But not the main reason given in this post, which does misleading atmospheric CO2 accounting.", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

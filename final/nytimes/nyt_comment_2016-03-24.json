For those that cannot afford it, this is the first step in a very dangerous spiral down to back alley abortions. If a woman cannot protect her ability to choose when or if she wants a child, and becomes pregnant, that same woman will undoubtedly run into serious problems with all of the new/recent TRAP laws. She'll have difficulty getting to a clinic that performs abortions, if there's one near her, and those TRAP laws will make her go through days or weeks of red tape. Until, of course, it's too late for a first trimester abortion, which is the purpose of the laws in the first place. Delay, delay, delay. She might be tempted by a back alley abortion, and she may not survive. But do the justices think about the future \"her\"?

But isn't it really the insurance company's plan to begin with, which the employer provides as part of the employee's compensation package? If so, how is it being \"hijacked\" from the employer. If the employer was an ordinary for-profit business corporation, it would receive a tax deduction for it's cost as a business expense: the the company doesn't buy it for itself, it buys the plan for its employees. Sounds like the insurance belongs to the employees. Whether for or non-profit, the employer could easily<br/> provide a \"flex-benefit\"  cash payment to each employee to buy insurance directly and thus not be taxed on the amount<br/>-- would that cash payment somehow implicate the church-related proprietors in how the employee used that cash? There is no stateable limit to that sort of exception, unless we want to say religiously affiliated employers now must be exempted from the minimum wage or paying any wages at all given that the employees might do something sinful with that money.

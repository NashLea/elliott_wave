I said the *state space* of the climate system is infinite dimensional. In general terms, it can be described as an interacting collection of fields (fluid flow, radiation flux, etc.)--partial differential equations, not ordinary differential equations. A state of the system at a single moment in time must specify the values of all these quantities over the entire 3d volume of the atmosphere and oceans--an infinite number of values.<br/><br/>Contrast with the three body problem (which is also chaotic). Here we are dealing with a system of ordinary differential equations where the state of each body can be described with just two quantities--position and momentum--so the state space is only 6-dimensional.<br/><br/>Are you clear on that now?

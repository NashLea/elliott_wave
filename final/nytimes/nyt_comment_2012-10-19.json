So his jobs program makes no sense even according to his own philosophy, since the source of job creation is additional investments by the upper classes made possible by reducing their taxes.  <br/><br/>Second, I too was struck the the remarks to the funders about how the mere news of his election would spur investment (and that statement has not gotten the scrutiny that it deserves, since it is almost as offensive as his comments about the 47%).  If Romney's assertion is true,  then the 1% are essentially holding the economy hostage until their man gets elected.  They are willing to forego profitable investments now, just to keep the economy in poor condition, and hurt Obama's chances to be re-elected.

Several times, I've flown to a new city with $100.00 in my pocket, and had work by the next day. Have faith that things will work out. Don't let depression set in, it's very real and will hold you back from moving on. Go out to the coffeeshop and talk to everyone you see. I've gotten jobs this way, too. You never know who will walk in.<br /><br />My job finding strategy is this: send a resume to every job opening, and go through the phone book page by page, calling every company, until you have a job. Do whatever it takes. Every job requires on the job training, you just need to show a willingness to learn. Take the first job that comes along, even if it sucks. From there, something better will come along. When I lived in Portland, I would wake up at 3:30am, walk to the Labor Ready site in the rain/snow, and wait for lousy day labor jobs to open up, that paid only $50.00 per day. I'm college educated and used to think I was special for that, but I wasn't above doing whatever it takes to pay the bills. I did this every day, while applying for every job I saw. Eventually, I got a steady job.<br /><br />When I moved to Texas at the beginning of the recession, I had a job 9 hours after I landed. The job was hard work, and after 2.5 years, I quit that job and started my own business.

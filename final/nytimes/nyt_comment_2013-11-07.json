Puritanism, and the assumption that no one could ever like sex work or find it worth the risks involved, still dominates the debate. That isn't to discount the very real horrors experienced by trafficking victims, but merely to suggest that many of our assumptions about prostitutes who are not trafficking/pimping victims are misplaced. <br/><br/>The act of exchanging sex for money, by itself, is completely neutral. When both parties consent under equal terms to such an exchange, no evil is being inflicted upon anyone. Evil only comes with prostitution when there is not consent and when the agreement isn't made on equal terms, i.e. if the prostitute has been enslaved or has a pimp. You can separate the former from the latter, and likewise change the legality accordingly. <br/><br/>The simple reality is that johns worry as much about getting caught as prostitutes do. If one class of prostitute is legal, and another is not, the overwhelming majority of johns are going to choose to patronize the former.  In such a context, a criminal will not be able to make much money from pimping, and will find another enterprise. If all prostitutes are equally illicit however, there's no reason for a john to avoid a pimp's offerings."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10461870, "replies": [], "commentID": 10466496, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "C Wolfe", "createDate": "1383850357", "userID": 30644652, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1383850389", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Miranda Meadows", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Bloomington, IN", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1383850389", "commentSequence": 10466496, "commentBody": "Miranda, as a non-Puritan I want to agree with you.

It's the selling.<br/><br/>So here's the question I've never found an answer to. Maybe you have. A prostitute differs from a porn star or erotic dancer or even a dominatrix in that the latter three offer a skilled performance for sale, while prostitution seems to me inevitably linked to slavery because the body itself is sold, if only for a limited time. How is renting your body out different from selling it? SIncere question. Some desperate people might be willing to sell themselves into slavery for meals and a place to sleep, but we still make slavery illegal as contrary to the principles of a free society. Choosing to sell yourself\u2014into permanent slavery or temporarily as a prostitute\u2014is the opposite of free. <br/><br/>So in looking at \"volitional\" prostitutes, we have to define volition. Correct me if I'm wrong, but surely very few prostitutes wouldn't prefer another line of work if it gave them the same income for an equal number of flexible hours.

However, pornography is only a difference of degree: use my image to achieve sexual release, while fantasizing about how you would use me were we to actually meet. So is all sex work unacceptable then? I don't think it is.<br/><br/>While the Deontological arguments against sex work and pornography are compelling, I ultimately find them unsatisfying. The dissatisfaction stems from the fact that sex work is, for me at least, actually quite enjoyable (yes, I am an escort/adult entertainer/porn performer, if you haven't figured it out by now). Pleasure isn't the measure of moral worth, but it's awfully hard to feel like I'm just being used or rented, when the experience is as enjoyable for me as it is the client. Likewise, the service which is provided to a client is often more than sex. Yes, sex is the first principle of prostitution, but based upon the conversations I have with my clients, there is some deeper emotional want that is being satisfied beyond the simple desire to orgasm. I don't have a complete answer for you, but sex work, to me, feels less like renting myself than providing entertainment, pleasure, and even therapy. Would I have sought out the men who see me if they weren't paying?

Likewise, your characterization of sex work being dominated by pimps and traffickers is at odds with your mention of Backpage. The internet, in sites like Backpage, Eros Guide, and My Red Book, has largely made pimps irrelevant to escorting and prostitution. Sex workers are able to advertise, promote their brand, screen clients, share blacklists, etc. with nothing more than a PC and an internet connection. Since no volitional escort/prostitute has need of a pimp, that means the only prostitutes involved with pimps are those who are being exploited, trafficked or enslaved. The solution then is simple: legalize prostitution, issuing licenses to pimp-free prostitutes/escorts, while increasing the penalties for pimps and for johns who see unlicensed, i.e. exploited or trafficked, prostitutes. The simple reality is the demand for sex workers isn't going to go away -- it's already illegal to solicit a prostitute and yet the demand is still there. Instead, work under the assumption that the demand is going to be there, but change incentive structures so that johns choose licensed, volitional prostitutes over the unlicensed and exploited. <br/><br/>Your \"solution\" doesn't fix the problem -- we already punish pimps and johns more severely than providers, even if the latter get arrested more -- and has the side effect of killing the livelihood of volitional sex workers.

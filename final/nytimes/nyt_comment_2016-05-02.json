Can you find the link for such a (wrong) claim? It's nowhere in this article, and it's nowhere in any of my comments. So who's saying it and putting a burr under your saddle?<br/>What the English Premier League IS, is the richest league in the world, and one with a sustainable revenue distribution system. It's been about 7 years since Portsmouth went into administration due to fiscal mismanagement in England. Meanwhile, La Liga saw a team relegated for failure to pay its players LAST YEAR.<br/>Every year, each EPL team nets $8 million per year from the sale of the media rights to Comcast-NBCSN, for broadcast here in 'Murica alone. That's a sum that approximates what some of the La Liga minnows get in total media rights, and the American market doesn't take into account Asian rights, African rights, European rights, and the \u00a3 billion in domestic UK rights.<br/>It accounts for the steady flow of Bundesliga players into England, and the relative parity in the league. In Germany, there are 4 teams with +10 GD or better, out of 18. In Spain, it's five out of 20. In England, the number is 8 of 20.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3451615, "replies": [], "lft": 143, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/stellar-work/", "parentID": 18389268, "commentID": 18392476, "rgt": 144, "userDisplayName": "Keta Hodgson", "createDate": "1462162565", "userID": 4153802, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1462162626", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "West Hollywood", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1462159026", "commentSequence": 18392476, "commentBody": "MOL, you've always been dazzling but you made 21 five letter words from that Spelling Bee?

My greatest effort was on cramming for finals to pass even though I had a genius IQ and would get lectured even in collage on being lazy. When I did study, I invariably got the highest grades and made enemies. I'm a firm believer that the social order is meant for certain people to become the 1% or leaders and the rest of us are doomed to a Sisyphus life. It's a very good feeling to see a child working to accomplish something and getting a reward but is this the reality we live in? Why is there a subconscious mind? We live in fantasies and refuse to admit this.

What they are saying is that there should be an up or down vote to raise the debt ceiling in both houses of Congress.  Instead of that we get the \"Hastert Rule\" in the House, which prevents the body from even holding a vote unless the Republican majority - including some real mouthbreathers - internally agrees to hold one, and, of course, the odious filibuster in the Senate.  The fact that the President voted whichever way he did has NOTHING to do with these undemocratic shenanigans by which a minority is essentially extorting the rest of us.

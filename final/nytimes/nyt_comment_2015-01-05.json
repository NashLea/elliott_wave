Today, we're in the same situation, except the bubble of speculation is much bigger. <br/><br/>The economic role of presidents is \"not much\" because the majority of them are puppets of Wall Street. Some exceptional presidents that weren't tools of Wall Street were Lincoln and FDR.  Lincoln bypassed Wall Street by having the government take over the creation and issuance of the currency with the greenback system, while FDR passed Glass-Steagall and wrote off the worthless gambling debt, while also having the Reconstruction Finance Corporation lend direct credit to industry to build the country back up. Obama has refused to re-enact Glass-Steagall, helping set the stage for another economic implosion. The biggest U.S. banks, which now reportedly have some $240 trillion in derivatives exposure, have been allowed to pile up almost all of it on their FDIC-insured commercial banking units since Glass-Steagall was eliminated in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Obama supported the outrageous mid-December power play by which Wall Street banks forced Congress to grant FDIC insurance to their commodity and credit derivatives. That mid-December bribery-and-corruption orgy was led by Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley banks (along with their stickman, Barack Obama).

Of course, Sarkozy accomplished that with a little help from his friends across the pond. Everything about this case has the stink of an orchestrated conspiracy. The case was booked as if in a hurry, pulling a dignitary off the plane at the last moment. Then the prosecutor- Vance Jr.- went around blathering that it is an open and shut case. American and American sponsored correspondentswrote numerous columns (suddenly, and all these years they kept quiet?) how Kahn used to womanize during IMF meetings everywhere. Now, here is the clincher: Within 48 hours and no more of  Christine Lagarde, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sarkozy, ascended to the post of IMF chief, the case against Kahn began crumbling, and he is a free man today. No Conspiracy? Not against someone who might have issues with American hegemony like Jacques Chirac did? Not against Kahn who is less corporatist than Sarkozy, and  he is tipped to be a heavy favorite to be the next president of an important ally? \r<br/><br/>Sarkozy has been extremely unpopular over the last several months. He might have or might not have lost the election. But all politicians suffer from a bout of paranoid attacks aka the Watergate flu every now and then. Also explains the gamble he took in rushing into Libya. If it did not pay off, French people would have crucified him anyway. He might ride a wave of popularity as Libya's liberator  for sometime but as in the case of Dubya's Dad,  Greece and Italy together could topple Sarkozy's apple cart after all. \r<br/><br/>Remember \u201cit\u2019s the economy stupid?\u201d? 1992?

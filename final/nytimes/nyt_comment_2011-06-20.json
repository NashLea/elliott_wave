I used to work about a month a year on an oceanographic research vessel and spent a fair amount of time on weather deck obtaining data. I always wore knee-high rubber boots and a hard hat, and when the sea was up, rubber-ducky yellow Helly Hansens as well, thus being covered from head to toe with a waterproof membrane. One day, while collaborating with a winch operator on a CTD cast, I was hit full in the face by a wave that rolled horizontally over the afterdeck. The hood of my jacket and the hard hat channeled the water down the back of my neck so that my shirt was soaked. I had just finished thinking, at least my trousers are still dry, when the next wave came crashing down vertically and rebounded off the deck up my pant legs before cascading down into my boots, so that all my clothing was now sopping wet and my feet were immersed to ankle height by cold seawater. \u201cAlee\u201d may mean \u201csafe\u201d or \u201csheltered\u201d in Topeka, Kansas, but not to those who go down to \u2014 or in \u2014 the sea in ships.

The guy took a red eye to DC overnight and he knew he would not start today. Only the gullible press bought the lame \"Bob made a great decision\" angle. What nonsense.<br/><br/>A poster thinks that Michael Bradley is a great player? What?  <br/><br/>He is the gaffer's son that is why he starts every match regardless of his performance.<br/>\nMichael was average today as he is most of the time. This is a player that mostly sat on Aston Villa's bench this past season. <br/><br/>Jones's played well but was lucky not to get sent off for a cynical foul early and his dive was simply, disgraceful. I'd score it a 9.5, splash.<br/><br/>Dempsey was again average and Ricketts almost got to him before the showboating Clint scored.<br/><br/>If only Clint was as good as he thinks he is.<br/><br/>It is obvious Bradley and Jones need to play off each other better. They are too similar in style. Most of the time when they attempt to distribute the ball they give the ball back or make a poor pass. Why are both of them in? Why not Edu and Adu against Panama. Start a creative midfielder (Adu) that can dribble 5 yards. Jones already has a yellow. Any bets how quickly he gets carded against Panama?<br/><br/>Goodson is a nightmare in waiting, again. Cherundolo played well as did Boca.<br/>\nLichaj's score was too high and he is pretty green. I can see him getting skinned against Panama.<br/><br/>Bedoya played well but Kjlestan was way over rated. An 8? Come on. They both got width but only one goal was scored today by a USA player. Remember that.<br/><br/>Panama must be happy they got the Yanks again. Their forwards will hound the USA backline and they will stack the midfield just like they did in the Group match. <br/><br/>Seemingly the USA can get revenge. They were played off the pitch last Saturday by Panama. They probably cannot play that poorly again, or can they?<br/><br/>May the best side win.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2870280, "replies": [], "lft": 48, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/players-ratings-u-s-vs-jamaica/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4021845, "rgt": 49, "userDisplayName": "gtg007w", "createDate": "1308542933", "userID": 55884819, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1308550168", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1308546568", "commentSequence": 23, "commentBody": "I'm glad the USA won after playing awfully in the group stages and even this game.

Yes, he contributed a lot to this game and even scored, own goal or not. However, the way he picked up his yellow card and his diving to get the opponent sent off... That was unprofessional by all means and just for that, my rating for him will go down to a 6.5, 7 if I'm being generous.

They did not know the answer. So they searched on the internet and got the answer and again said WOW. Now I know for sure the malady of America.

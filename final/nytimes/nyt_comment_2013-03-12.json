To totally destroy original Yankee Stadium was dead wrong.  It embodied much of New York's great history.<br/><br/>The current Yankee Stadium has a statue of George Steinbrenner. Babe Ruth saved baseball and is the God of baseball. A statue of Babe, and hopefully other Yankee greats would not detract from the<br/>Steinbrenner legacy of winning baseball, nor would such masterpieces be something for the Steinbrenner family to fear.<br/><br/>There's room for the Steinbrenners, the Babe, and others. They all come under the title, \"New York Yankees.\" The Yankees have the greatest history in the world of sports. I'm proud of that history and would be even prouder if the fear of Babe Ruth's ghost would not rule<br/>decisions in a detrimental way, as has been done in the past.

Many areas must use truck delivered oil for home heating.  We need to invest in US projects that broadly benefit the economy of the United States.

Clearly, we must invest in Public Goods that make economic activity more efficient -- like the Interstate Maglev Network, which can be paid for by the users,  The US needs to test and certify the new 2nd generation Maglev developed by Drs.

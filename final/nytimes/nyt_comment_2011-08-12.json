Romm is mostly a politician (though some use the less desirable but possibly more accurate title, professional hired political hack) and Revkin is mostly a semi-retired Science Journalist, now an opinion columnist.  Oddly enough, in a two-sided list of players in the Climate Wars, they are on the same side, though Romm is rather very far to the left, while Revkin is closer to the middle.  <br/><br/>The more rabid AGW alarmists always seem to want to make bets, and then attack those who decline the offer, usually implying that 'their' refusal to bet means  that 'their' opinion is obviously wrong or that 'they' are somehow morally deficient.  <br/><br/>In my opinion, the Romm making an issue of the bet/refusal-to-bet is childish....which I consider much worse than Gore's recent use of use of rough language in a public address.", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 3095162, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/planet-of-the-hominids/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4334159, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Andrew Revkin", "createDate": "1313122602", "userID": 2781029, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1313123495", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Dot Earth blogger", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1313119895", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "Here's a link to the Public Workshop of the Committee on the Use of Chimpanzees in Biomedical and Behavioral Research at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies: <a href=\"http://j.mp/iomChimps\" title=\"http://j.mp/iomChimps\" target=\"_blank\">http://j.mp/iomChimps</a>  ", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3090632, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/yankees-looking-up-and-down/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4333169, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "Dan", "createDate": "1313104285", "userID": 18698859, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1313123550", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Frederick, Maryland", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1313119950", "commentSequence": 12, "commentBody": "For  those of us who are not paid to manage the Yanks, a quiet resentment toward Girardi is pardonable as WE see things several weeks before HE sees things.

Mariano is, indeed, the greatest ever, but now is not ever; it is NOW.  AJ does not belong in the pen -- where he is likely to become even more introspective, analytical and nuts.  He belongs in Scranton where, over a course of three or four starts, he just might return to the Bronx in shape to help us into and through the playoffs.  Oh, call it a torn meniscus rather than a brain eruption.  But the kind of help AJ needs begins with his ARM -- as in THROW EACH PITCH AS IF IT IS TO BE YOUR LAST.  Mariano?  I don't know.  You can't get younger on the bench.  There's something his ball is not doing, but his mechanics are as constant as the Northern Star.  We've got an older chap on our hands, and this is the time to give serious thought to when and where he is most likely to reclaim his confidence and his success rate.

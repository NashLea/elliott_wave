At least some of the gift cards will end up being given away, possibly to someone who has never shopped at Zappos before, so they might help recruit a new customer who will return to Zappos without a gift card.  And of course many customers who do redeem will end up buying something that costs much more than $50 and Zappos's margin might be enough to help cover the discount Zappos gave to AmEx on the gift card.<br /><br />With <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.com</a> purchases, by contrast, <a href=\"http://AmEx/Amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">AmEx/Amazon.com</a> know that the cardholder is definitely redeeming the points -- their MR account won't get charged until they actually buy something -- and since there's no tangible gift card there's no possibility that an AmEx cardholder who likes Amazon will give a physical card to someone who's never shopped at Amazon before.  So AmEx can only pay <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.com</a> how much it pays everyone else.  Presumably the 7/10 valuation indicates that AmEx often gets at least a 30% discount on gift cards.  (I say at least 30%, because it's possible that Amazon still offered AmEx a small discount or side payment since Amazon's inclusion in AmEx MR brochures help to promote Amazon even for non-rewards purchases.)<br /><br />Contrary to AmEx's stingy program, most major credit card issuers offer a cash back redemption option on their points-based rewards programs, and those redemption options often deliver more value to the consumer.  Chase Ultimate Rewards offers cash back redemption at the exact same valuation as gift cards; 2500 points gets you $25 in cash or a $25 gift card, whichever you prefer.  Discover actually offers higher valuations with gift cards; for example, you can redeem 25 cash back points for $25 in cash -- or for the same number of points get a $50 gift card from certain merchants.  (That should give you an idea of how much of a discount AmEx is actually getting on the gift cards it then resells to cardholders at full price.)  Bank of America WorldPoints, CitiBank's ThankYou Network, and Wells Fargo also offer cash back redemption options.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 1856626, "replies": [], "lft": 5, "assetURL": "http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/membership-rewards-worth-little-at-amazon-com/", "parentID": 2548417, "commentID": 2548675, "rgt": 6, "userDisplayName": "Ron Lieber", "createDate": "1284696086", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1284696086", "userTitle": "Bucks editor", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1284692486", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Great stuff, thanks.

I don't mind calling attention to my award-winning doctorate either, since so many of the people who post here seem to assume that independents and conservatives are uninformed about politics.  My job, as far as it goes, is to confront stereotypes with more accurate and timely information.  I'm grateful the NYT has given me this opportunity.  The larger issue is that President Obama's policies have left us with a 9.6% unemployment problem.  I know from the day-to-day experience of my wife's job search that this is an extremely painful issue for many families right now.  Personally, I was harmed as a young scholar by the work of both Michelle and Barack Obama to substitute African-American professors for more highly qualified Armenian-American professors. :)  Since I knew the young Obama, I guess I feel especially betrayed by this effort.  Historically, however, I know that those who hold to Marxist revolutionary philosophy have little regard for the \"little people\" harmed by their efforts.  I'm glad to do what I can now to prevent a second generation of young men and women from being harmed by the Democrat party the way I was so severely injured...", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 1857433, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/republican-group-sees-big-legislature-gains/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2548637, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Jacquelyn K Thompson", "createDate": "1284695390", "userID": 61073223, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1284698234", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1284694634", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Right now most of you will agree with me that our political system is broken.

Just a few examples:  You can double the value of your rewards at car rental companies (Alamo, Enterprise, National); gift companies (FTD, Mrs. Field's); and several cruise lines (Carnival, Celebrity, Norwegian, Princess, and Royal Caribbean); and at least one hotel chain (Hyatt).  There are fixed redemption amounts that vary by merchant.  The car rental companies generally offer $40 gift cards for 20 points, for example, whereas most cruise lines offer either a $80 card for 40 points or a $120 card for 60 points.  There are several other well-known merchants that offer smaller bonuses.  Clothes stores like Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers, Old Navy, American Eagle, Eddie Bauer, Gap, Lands' End, Nike, Old Navy, and L.L. Bean offer $50 gift cards for 40 points, or $25 cards for 20 points, for example.<br /><br />The one downside of Discover's offer is that they only give you 0.25% rewards on your first $3000 of spending in a year, and the 5% bonus categories (which can sometimes change as frequently as monthly) have such low limits that it's hardly worth the hassle it takes to sign up.  The fourth quarter 5% bonus categories have a limit of $300, for instance.  This has made me more of a fan of the Chase Freedom card, which has started offering 5% bonuses on up to $1500 in spending each quarter.  Chase also gives at least a full 1% reward on all other spending without the $3000 haircut and has no annual fee, so it's a decent option for people who may not be big spenders.  Unlike Discover, Chase does not offer higher face value rewards if you redeem for gift cards, but they do make it easy to redeem for cash (or anything else) at full value -- no dilution like AmEx has.<br /><br />Like AmEx, a lot of issuers try to dilute the value of points so most consumers (particularly lower-spending consumers) get less than one cent of cash value for their points.  Chase and Discover seem to be the least diluted as far as redemption options go.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1856962, "replies": [], "lft": 34, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/jimmy-carter-attacks-ted-kennedy/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2547732, "rgt": 35, "userDisplayName": "sensible citizen", "createDate": "1284676045", "userID": 21637516, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1284699215", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "seattle", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1284695615", "commentSequence": 45, "commentBody": "The short NYT piece appears not to incorporate some important segments of the Jimmy Carter \"60 Minutes\" interview.

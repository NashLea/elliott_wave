My wife managed a \"non-profit\" medical system in Seattle for 10 years and believe me when I tell you that profit (i.e. revenue above all their costs) was always a priority. UPMC in Pittsburgh is a \"non-profit\" and their executives are all multi-millionaires. UPMC is constantly buying real estate , building new facilities, buying out small practices and doing anything they can to eliminate any possible competition. The only improvement to patient care and preventive services that they devote any excess revenue to is miniscule compared to their business expansion and executive compensation. The had nearly $500M left after all expenses (including improvements to patient care, etc.) last year. They are the largest employer in the state. Nursing wages are some of the lowest in the country, despite the fact that health care costs in Pittsburgh are among the highest in the country. Why? Because UPMC controls the medical labor market and the health care market in the region.

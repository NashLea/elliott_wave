Instead of taking time to talk to their kids about respecting alcohol, they approached the issue by telling their kids \"if you ever touch alcohol you are grounded for six million years.\" This didn't stop their kids from drinking at all; they would just lie to their parents about where they were and what they were doing. <br/><br/>Freshman year of college (I go to a massive state school), it was blatantly obvious which of my peers were never exposed to alcohol in high school because they tended to be the ones passed out over a toilet by 9 pm or always bragging that they finished a whole handle of vodka in two hours. I'm not at all saying that you should encourage your teens to drink in HS; just make sure they know how to be responsible about it so that if they do choose to drink in college they can avoid dangerous situations.

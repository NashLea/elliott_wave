Much of the rage I see stems, I think, from helplessness--we are watching 2,520,000 gallons of oil spill each and every day (60,000 barrels X 42 gallons per barrel), and not only do we need our President to take action, we also need him to call on us to sacrifice. We should pay a gas tax, each one of us. We should pay $1.00 per plastic bag, each one of us. We should have an individual version of FDR's Victory Gardens. We should write letters to our Congressional Representatives and Senators and demand funding for clean energy and an end to sweetheart deals of oil leases. President Obama, ask us to act, and give us specific actions and goals and targets for each one of us to reach. And then, do what we, the people, cannot do: implement executive orders and push, push, push legislation. Write an executive order demanding that the military fund even 10% of its energy costs by using clean energy. Demand that military housing use solar panels. Instruct governments of states, cities and towns to revamp their building codes, or ask us to demand that our city council do it.<br /><br />And it is not only for the people whom you speak--it is for the creatures of the sea and the sea itself. Ask us to ACT, Mr. President. And while we are waiting, what is one thing you can do? Today, and every day, to reduce your energy use? Can you try one of the suggestions posted above? Can you post your own - in fact, every time you post on the NY Times or any blog, can you present one suggestion that is manageable and that people can do?<br /><br />If you are angry, then channel your anger into a productive use. Whether you are Republican, Democrat, Libertarian - who cares? We are Americans, and in our past, we have risen to crises time and time again by pulling together. It's long past time to pull together again.<br /><br />One last suggestion: throw out your tv. If that is too much, then try unplugging it one day a week. For that matter, unplug your appliances anyway - it actually saves energy as appliances continue to use power even when they are not in use. So make your morning coffee, and unplug your coffee maker.<br /><br />As a fellow American, I am calling on all of us to rise to the occasion, to work together to solve our problems, to do our part, no matter how small, to reduce our energy use.

The President deserves more credit for his speech than most seem to be giving him.<br /><br />2. This oil spill was a disaster for which the government has been totally unprepared.  That lack of preparation goes back decades.  Obama is the President least responsible for that lack of preparation.  Moreover, given the numerous substantial emergencies left in the wake of the Bush administration, it is grossly unfair to pin the lack of progress in energy and in environmental protection and in work place safety upon Obama.<br /><br />3. The President was no more capable of meaningfully addressing this oil spill in its first few weeks than most of us would have been.  The people who created and operated the drilling system were, obviously, way beyond their own depth, and did not have the tools to arrest the process. The agencies charged with supervising worker and environmental safety were steeped in conflict of interest and mis-feasance and non-feasance and, perhaps, mal-feasance. I have yet to see any of the critics making clear what they expected the President to do - other that in the expression of vague generalities.<br /><br />4. It bears repeating the obvious: some of the sharpest critics are those who were recently chanting \"drill baby drill\", and who are hastening to proclaim that this spill should not result in stringent regulation.<br /><br />5. The President has unequivocally taken responsibility for minimizing the damage, enforcing the obligations of BP, coming to the aid of the many people and places that are being hurt, and adopting regulations to reduce the future likelihood of such disasters, while moving forward on programs to develop alternate energy sources and reduced energy consumption.  He may not be as specific in all of this as some would like, but he is probably as specific as prudence and honesty will permit.<br /><br />6. I say all of this as an Obama supporter who would like to see him be less intent on compromise and more willing to aggressively lead in the direction of change.  In that regard, I must keep reminding myself that many Congressional members of his party are almost as beholden to the same special interests as are many Republicans.<br /><br />7. I hope that those who  criticize the President, as regards his approach to the oil spill, will start their criticism with the words: \" He should have said . . . .\", and end with the words, \" I know this would work because . . . \"<br /><br />Let's work with our President and let's make clear to all that we expect our legislators to give him their full support, while exercising proper oversight, unsullied by hypocrisy and opportunism.<br /><br />HJBoitel", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1558511, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/participants-in-climate-reviews-suggest-changes/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2132145, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "Mike Roddy", "createDate": "1276656546", "userID": 17173195, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1276661764", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Yucca Valley, Ca.", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1276658164", "commentSequence": 32, "commentBody": "wmar, Stern 's coathors were chosen from the British Academy, and included top economists, too, not Pielke clones like Tol.<br /><br />Deniers in the Dot Earth comment section?

Putting him in charge of the effort to plug the leak is nonsense and I certainly hope that he has not been in charge, other than in a symbolic sense. A petroleum engineer with expertise and experience in drilling and completion needs to be in charge with the best expertise in the country from industry, academia, and national labs at his/her side. The oil recovery projects needs to be led by folks who know how to manage complex projects. The oil clean up needs to be managed by folks who have done this before, using the best talent in industry, academia, state and federal governmens. Need someone who can simplify the overlapping authority of more than a dozen federal agencies...a single person. The Coast Guard admiral is a terrific guy, but even he can either oversee the clean up or provide information to infinite number of reporters, politicians and the President, and be a tour guide. One ususally assigns those tasks to PR folks and not to the critically needed incident commander. Instead of beating up BP it would be more useful to work with BP and help the flow of funds to the people who need to be paid for lost income.

The fossil fuels and nuclear industries, to their discredit, play the friend of the poor when someone wants to tax energy.

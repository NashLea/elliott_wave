It is truly a shame whoever participated in hacking over 77+ million peoples entertainment network. Did you focus on a bank? A stock broker firm? No, you took something away from the average person's means of having some happiness and fun while they're not busting hump during this terrible economy. Honesty, you (hackers) should be ashamed of such a target.  <br/><br/>I own both a PS3 and Xbox(360), and also several PC games. To be frank, IMHO PC games blow away both consoles, at least for high-end PC's. My sound card alone costs as much  as an Xbox. But, my PC cannot play Guitar Hero. My 3rd absolute favorite online game behind a couple unnamed but well know MMORPGs. While I think Activision pulled the plug on GH series way too soon, I had invested not only in my PS3 which I specifically chose for GH, but several hundreds of dollars in the PS3 GH series, because I simply enjoy it. I'm not great at it, but it makes a tough day at work melt away. <br/><br/>What we (and I can't speak for all of us) gamers are upset about, is the lack of a simple timeframe when PSN will be back on. Really folks, that simple. Of course credit card fraud potential is paramount. To many of us, that is not the chief concern, we buy the PS3 cards or use pre-purchased cards to buy what we want...seriously if you use your main bank account card for PS3 or Xbox game time/store, etc...shame on you. I honestly wish more companies would get their act together and use PayPal...an exceptional service. <br/><br/>I work in the field of Safety/Risk Management. It is beyond my comprehension, that a company the size of Sony, a global Fortune 100 firm, did not have a plan in-place, and ready to execute. There's this thing many companies call a business continuity plan, or business contingency plan. I'm thinking that surely at least one of the talented people at Sony has brought this up as a concern at some point. I'd be willing to bet that at least one intelligent network designer has previously informed management, if this happens, we may have a problem. Many times such people are frowned upon by management, even told to \"play ball\" or else...work elsewhere's. I'm curious...just saying. I only know this because I've been in that position in the pharmaceutical business no less. They found a way to fire me with only 43-days to qualify for a pension. I'll live, my conscience is clean.<br/><br/>So, D-Day came and Sony was caught with their pants down. I've always been a student (albeit amateur) of Asian culture. Let me tell you all, when the three executives bowed their heads before the world...it was the most sincere gesture a Japanese executive could have possibly made. But, to most of the world, we just want a date. I saw an article someone mentioned this will not impact Sony financially much...probably from someone who owns Sony stock, or even worse, some broker's puppet. Granted it's only a piece of the Sony pie; however, for guys like me...I invest for the long term. Apologies aside, communications by Sony has been below par. Say what you will, but Microsoft is the dominant OS on this planet and they are not in this situation. Give us a date Sony and keep it, or please or face up to the longer term alternative.

Not one Board member had the moral courage to challenge the outrageous and slanderous comments made by a radical, self-focused, self-absorbed, political hack; and the Chancellor (as usual) stood by and said nothing. I'm embarrassed for the students, faculty (both full-time and contingent), and hard-working staff of CUNY. We deserve better than this, and we should all call on a Vote of No Confidence on this current bunch of Board members (and many of the expensive administrators they have endorsed and we have had to endure). Members of the CUNY Board of Trustees have violated the public trust, have abrogated their responsibilty to act as trustees, to protect the institution.\r<br/><br/>Rather than protect the institution and the students who spend their hard-earned money to receive an education, the current members of the CUNY Board of Trustees have consistently undermined academic freedom at every campus. They have consistently put their own selfish economic interests and political agendas, above the needs of our students and the City's most vulnerable. Indeed, they have preyed upon the vulnerable. Our Chancellor is also culpable, as today's editorial makes clear. And the Kushner business is only one of the many egregious acts committed by this Board, along with the Chancellor, their silent partner. They are currently attacking general education (and \"selling\" their latest assault on academic freedom as \"helping\" our students navigate their way through general education requirements). They clearly know nothing about education, or the by-laws that are supposed to guide their decisions. Knowledge, trust--these things seem to matter very little to the member sof CUNY's Board of Trustees.\r<br/><br/>For neglecting their fiduciary responsibility, and moral obligation, to the public we all serve, for abrogating their duty to uphold the public trust, New Yorkers should demand the resignations of all current Board Members now serving as CUNY Trustees. It's the only way to save one of the nation's most important institutions of public higher education, one of the few that has long promised to serve the under-served, including first-generation, immigrant, working-class students. Shame on this shameful group. Our students deserve better--and we should demand that they receive a Board of Trustees and other senior administrators who will protect their future rather than demolish it. \r", "recommendationCount": 79}, {"assetID": 2707154, "replies": [], "lft": 52, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/a-matter-of-degrees/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3793652, "rgt": 53, "userDisplayName": "charles", "createDate": "1304743984", "userID": 31229171, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304744821", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "AK", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304741221", "commentSequence": 18, "commentBody": "a once great institution shows its shabby side, more likely its decline, with a weak and careless Board presided over by a failed Yale President and one politicking fool who places his personal vendettas before the well-being of the institution and a number indifferent trustees of little intellect and which follow like sheep their ignorant leadership.", "recommendationCount": 87}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

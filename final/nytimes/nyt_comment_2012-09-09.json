I know that I'm not doing enough, and while I post my comments and cries in vain to the Kenyan, Tanzania, Gabonese, Zimbabwe, Congolese, and Ugandan sites, elephants continue to be slaughtered on mass, their beautiful faces butchered and removed by machetes before they're even dead, so that these greedy, despicable thugs can steal every ounce of ivory.  Your assessment is correct - people who care live in fragmented parts of the world, and no one seems to care enough to fight. I cannot tell you how many nights I've wept about this after I read the African blogs and newspapers.  There's a perception that most of the poachers are poor, but many of them are well equipped with high tech weapons and night vision goggles. Even when the poachers are caught, they're usually given small token fines, and they're released with little to no jail time.

For the author of this article to suggest no one blames (thus holds accountable) politicians today for false statements during their campaigns is nonsense. Voters in America do expect honesty from political candidates as evidenced by Bush, 41's defeat.  In this article, the author has made assumptions regarding race and politics that likely reflect his own political outlook. It is my position that a very high percentage of non-black voters in the general election of 2008, perceived Obama's political viewpoint to be other than what it is.  Today there is a much greater awareness of his personal political views and his political agenda than were known of Candidate Obama's in 2008. If race was not a consideration for the majority of non-white voters in 2008, why would anyone think it is different today? There is nothing embarrassing in recognizing that Obama wasn't what he was perceived to be when casting votes in the last general election based upon what was known about him then. Awakening to the reality of what he is politically about after observing his actions over his first term in office for many voters has been a revelation. It has for me.

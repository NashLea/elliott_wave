As long as each satisfies current and past observations, they are good until experiment eliminates one (or all) of them.  I think this is perhaps what you mean by \"just do it\".<br/><br/>Philosophy and especially math cannot sustain this.  Being purely deductive in nature, contradiction anywhere equals a collapse of the whole structure.  One only proceeds with assured steps, never tentative.<br/><br/>That science utilizes induction via observation is what allows for tentative logical stepping.  Of course the hope is that experimentation will eventually prune away all false paths.  In that end we would also be left with an entirely consistent logical structure, just arrived at in different fashion.<br/><br/>Math of course is the extreme form of deductive stepping, with each piece of the puzzle truly cemented in.  The tradeoff however is that the range of \"askable\" questions is very restricted (yet still mind-bogglingly vast!)<br/><br/>Science too is restricted, to the (sharable) observed.  The unobserved (or unshared observed) is beyond addressing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest benefit from philosophy is that it allows for the expression of heretofore inarticulate ideas and concepts.

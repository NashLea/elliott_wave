Although I appreciate the technical application of Irony given here, I don't think that is the true source of critical disdain for Les Miserables; that seems more like a movie genre issue while critical disdain of Les Miserables goes back to the stage.<br/><br/>Rather, I'd couch it in terms of how Les Miserables is a role reversal between experts and the general population.  As a story, Les Miserables is meant to convey a cultural experience about a very specific time period in France.  That cultural experience was had by the larger population, and it was greatly defined by a small group of privileged \"bourgeois\" being so disconnected from that cultural experience.  Normally, the general population defers to an expert to deliver insights and understanding on a given topic.  But Les Miserables is a powerful invocation of the cultural experience of the masses not just offering itself to disconnected experts and nobles, but practically demanding that it be understood.  Not allowing intellectual distance, confronting us with raw and open emotional pleas, leaning on simpler themes that cannot be misunderstood or reinterpreted: these are all devices for commanding a certain unity in experience (\"the event\" in marxist terms).

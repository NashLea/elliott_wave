However it is possible that humans too have the ability to reincarnate or rejuvenate however in our new lives we cannot remember our past self. Without the consciousness of a former life, it is hard to determine if other species besides jellyfish are \"immortal\". In a way human life is like a jellyfish's; we begin as babies and as we grow up we slowly regress back into a state much like that of a baby's in our old age.<br/>\nAlso I think that the concept of mortality goes hand in hand with the concept of time. Similarly to the common perception of reincarnation, the popular belief is that time moves linearly.  There is, however, a possibility that  time moves in a circle, and that the lives we live have already been lived and will continue to be lived for eternity.<br/>\nIt is good that scientists study jellyfish \"immortality\" because although the general concept of immortality and reincarnation is a mystery that may never be solved, jellyfish immortality may help us to find ways to reverse or slow down the negative effects of aging.

The percentage of income subject to payroll tax increased on the basis that the funds would be held in trust for future beneficiaries, but the Feds used this money to offset their deficit spending (racked up mainly by GOP administrations). And while the Feds claim they'll pay it back, the \"entitlement reform\" the GOP deems so necessary \"to address our deficit problem\" is really an attempt to deprive the poor and middle class of their dedicated contributions twice - once when the funds were withheld from their pay and a second time when benefits are cut.<br/><br/>Even <a href=\"http://factcheck.org\" title=\"factcheck.org\" target=\"_blank\">factcheck.org</a> has the misinformed view that these programs contribute to the deficit because the amounts raided from the trust fund must be repaid - which exacerbates the deficit. Well, so do our debts to other holders of treasuries, but we don't expect them to take a haircut because our debt to them contributes to the deficit.

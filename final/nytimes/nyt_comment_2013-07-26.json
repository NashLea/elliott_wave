I would add or reiterate a couple of them.  We took our kids last year when they were 11 and 14.  First, rent an apartment.  The rates are better than hotels and the ability to spread out is very important.  Second, we took a bike tour of the city and really enjoyed that.  The street level view and the ability to go through neighborhoods (not just tourist areas) was terrific.  Third, my kids loved Luxembourg Gardens.  Sailing the boats is fun and I am surprised that no one has mentioned the playground.  An amazing place, even for the 14 year old.  And it is near the carousel.

Yes, we have cool electronic gadgets (but still no laser guns!) which I never would have dreamed of 40 years ago, but the infrastructure, and how we get around, has been a HUGE disappointment.

And the US has failed miserably to keep up with other countries building high-speed rail. We even killed the space program. We were on pace to have a lunar base by the 1980s, visit Mars in the 1990s, and have a Mars base by now, with exploration to the outer planets. Instead, we haven't gone past low-Earth orbit since Apollo 17. <br/><br/>And the places people live have been equally disappointing. \"New\" homes  that are faux versions of old styles, complete with \"fake\" window panes.

While we're at it, why not reduce the size to something more in keeping with the fact that most cars rarely carry more than the driver? Make something with three wheels instead of four which tilts in turns. Make it ultra streamlined so you can get 200 miles or more range from a small battery. Keep the weight under 500 pounds, the length under 10 feet. Sell it for under $10,000. There's a car which might appeal to some of today's youth who might otherwise have zero desire to own any car. And such a vehicle would be eminently more sensible for the vast majority of drivers than a 3 ton SUV with a 300 HP gasoline engine.

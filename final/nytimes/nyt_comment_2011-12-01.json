The first one left me groggy for a few hours. The second one, which was mild as these things go, left me lower-functioning for weeks, and with daily migraines for a month. And I knew about concussions, so I took some basic care of myself following the second one.<br/><br/>How did I know? My seven year-old son got one from falling on a concrete garage floor when he was wrestling with his sister. It made his first six weeks of school this year an absolute nightmare. He had the depression, the anxiety, the inability to concentrate. He lost friends, couldn't learn, snapped at people at home, didn't sleep well, and had visual migraines so disturbing that we had to take him to a pediatric opthamologist to be he wasn't suffering from some rare eye disorder. His new teacher asked us if he had been tested for ADHD, even after we'd told her he had a serious concussion. This is at a school with a \"concussion plan\" system in place! Supposedly, she should have understood how devastating this injury would be. But as a teacher myself, I can say that though I also had a kid on a concussion plan at the beginning of the year, few folks at my school have any real understanding of what this injury can do, including coaches.<br/><br/>If you haven't had a serious concussion(s), you can't imagine the damage it can do to your brain for weeks, months or years afterward. Some concussions are inevitable, but football courts them. The least they can do is heavily insure every single young athlete so that they are fully covered if they suffer from brain injury during play. <br/><br/>If you think this is just something a bunch of college boys need to get over, you have no idea how series even minor head injuries can be.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 3293064, "replies": [], "lft": 166, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/nyregion/parents-who-abducted-their-8-children-say-they-feared-adoption-plans.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4976593, "rgt": 167, "userDisplayName": "Nadya", "createDate": "1322708991", "userID": 65290375, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1322715924", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1322715924", "commentSequence": 68, "commentBody": "It's concerning that children could be removed from a home without a single criminal charge of abuse.

A few parting thoughts:<br/><br/>1. What distinguished NYT comments from every other website (including major papers such as the Washington Post) was the fact that most comments addressed the article, not each other. Comments were often comprehensive, well thought out, and insightful. When comments did address each other, they did so at length and not in the casual conversational manner that is now inevitable. Many comments tended to be as good (and often better) than published Letters to the Editor.<br/><br/>2. In comment threads that climb into the hundreds, Editor's Picks provided an excellent way to skim the most insightful remarks, without wasting time reading through repetitive comments. It appears this feature has been replaced by \"trusted\" commenters -- a poor substitution. And linking to Facebook is simply silly: If a pseudonym has consistently provided respectful, interesting comments, why does the NYT need to link it to a \"real\" name? -- one imagines a certain historical author would have had to link to a \"Samuel L. Clemens\" account.<br/><br/>3. The \"Read More\" expansions are annoying and make skimming more difficult; moreover, the loading time is slow.<br/><br/>4. Putting newest comments first and threading comments are the two changes that have the potential to be beneficial.<br/><br/>Luckily, reporting -- not comments -- is why I read the NYT.", "recommendationCount": 115}, {"assetID": 3293244, "replies": [], "lft": 172, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/business/media/a-note-to-our-readers-about-comments.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4976974, "rgt": 173, "userDisplayName": "Gabe", "createDate": "1322715565", "userID": 7834680, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1322716040", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1322716040", "commentSequence": 53, "commentBody": "Hate it.

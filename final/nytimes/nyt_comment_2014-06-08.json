The Preakness will attract about half of those who ran in the Derby. But if the same horse wins both? You would be lucky to get three of the Preakness AND Derby horses to run in the Belmont. Do you just want to KILL of the most challenging of the three to win? I live right around the corner from Belmont, and the elementary school that my daughters' attended has the majority of its parking and all of its athletic fields (which are huge) that were donated to it back in the 1950s by the NY Racing Association, whose then president was President of our local school board. If you are TRULY concerned with the horses' well being, you would NEVER seek to *compel* them to run in races too frequent for their well being.<br/>The fact of the matter is that 30, 40 or 50 years ago, horses *regularly* raced twice in two weeks. Now, the only time in a horse's career that that happens is the short stretch between the Derby and Preakness.<br/>Fair game might be to stretch out the series: Derby stays the same-First Saturday in May. Push the Preakness back to the fourth Saturday in May, and make the Belmont the last Saturday in June, just before New York Racing heads for Saratoga for the Summer Meet.

Edibles should ONLY be sold in INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED single doses, with BIG warnings (like tobacco) about the delayed reaction effect. They should NOT be manufactured in child-friendly forms (gummy bears, etc). I first smoked pot when I was 15 (1967), but stopped when I was in my late 30's. Alcohol became my \"drug of choice\" for recreation, but now that I'm in my 60's, the unnecessary calories, cancer and liver disease risk, and DUI risk is steering me back to cannabis.  It's been 45 years since Woodstock nation and legalization is WAY overdue. Maureen, puff a couple bowls of MODERATE strength pot, and report back to the masses about your experience.

We spent our early mornings eating a great breakfast on the roof top and our late evening with drinks and snacks on the roof top terrace. Location was very close to all major attractions and yet quiet being on a side street. Hotel offered free airport transport as we stayed at least 3 days. Can't think of a better place to have stayed to explore Istanbul on our first trip to Turkey<br/>\nThe highlight of the hotel is the friendliness and courtesy of the staff. They arranged tickets for us at a show of Turkish dancing and transfers to the airport, plus providing maps and tips on where to go.<br/>\nWe plan to return to Istanbul and would definitely stay at the Valide Sultan , and do not hesitate in giving it a very high recommendation.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://hotelvalidesultan.com/virtual-tour/\" title=\"http://hotelvalidesultan.com/virtual-tour/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hotelvalidesultan.com/virtual-tour/</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3333433, "replies": [], "lft": 125, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/not-done/", "parentID": 6817764, "commentID": 6818723, "rgt": 126, "userDisplayName": "John", "createDate": "1344485059", "userID": 12857582, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1344485114", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1344481514", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Howie - My point is you do not need to disparage Aaron to make a case for Bonds.

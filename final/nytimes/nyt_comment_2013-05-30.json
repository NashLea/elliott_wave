Years ago, for a short time, I worked with a relatively small group whose tradition was to always eat lunch together.

Here's one example I remember:<br/><br/>COWORKER: What are you eating for lunch? ME: Uh, minestrone soup. COWORKER: Are there noodles in there? Me: Uh, a few. COWORKER: Oh, well, I can't eat that!! ME: Uh, OK.<br/><br/>On and on went said self-absorbed, food-obsessed bore, who, all the while bemoaning her weight (while trumpeting her supposed self-dicipline) wore ill-judged, overly revealing clothing, particularly for the office. Unsurprisingly, of her 3 teenage children, 2 were very overweight and 1 looked waifish. Growing up listening to that, it's no surprise none were anywhere near the middle of the bell curve regarding weight. <br/><br/>PediatricianX, I love love love your prescription, \"just have a life.\" Personally, I have too many mental and physical things to do during the day between my career, hitting the gym, and wrangling 3 little kids to get through it on little/no food, or give all my attention to resisting hunger.

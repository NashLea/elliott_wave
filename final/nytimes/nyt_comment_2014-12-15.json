So the cleverer can always outwit and confuse the less clever in the complicated financial games. Secondly,just in case some young Turk in the lower camp come up with objections,outwitting the best of the best, he/she is easily offered something which it is difficult to refuse and whisked away into the ranks  of the Wall Street or made to toe the line,on the other side.These ground realities make mockery of self- regulation by the banks who continue to prosper not through fair and free trade but through \"crony capitalism\" as Paul has put it.<br/><br/>It is nothing short of swindling or conning the public for which all bankers and corporation CEOs would have been in jail long back had not the banks wrote the laws as City Group did as Paul Krugman has correctly revealed here.<br/><br/>Every one knows the problems of why and how the common man/woman is deprived of their rights in this so called democracy; how and why wealth got accumulated in the hands of the 1%; wealth which belonged to the 99% . <br/><br/>But nobody , including Paul Krugman,seems to know the way out of this quagmire."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 13588690, "replies": [], "commentID": 13591117, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Len Charlap", "createDate": "1418654458", "userID": 288945, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1418666230", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "RR", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Princeton, NJ", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1418666231", "commentSequence": 13591117, "commentBody": "Were you in Kuwait or Venus in 2008?"}]}, "lft": 248, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/opinion/paul-krugman-dodd-frank-damaged-by-the-budget-bill.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 13588690, "rgt": 255, "userDisplayName": "RR", "createDate": "1418622018", "userID": 70253721, "replyCount": 3, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1418622067", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Kuwait City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1418622067", "commentSequence": 13588690, "commentBody": "Well, in addition to DGA's correct observation that Wall Street is has been a much bigger backer of this President than his Republican rivals, it is also not quite correct that financial professionals have no history of policing themselves, with the most important example being that of accountants (and to some extent with the actuarial community).  Although Congress and then the SEC have ultimate authority over accounting standards, they have largely delegated authority to the industry bodies known as FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) and GASB (Government Accounting Standards Board).  These bodies have existed for so long that most people forget that they are perhaps the best examples of a financial industry working well to police itself and create standards that are adhered to in order to create a healthier industry for everyone.  Of course, if absolutely needed, the SEC and Congress can swoop in but in practice, that is not necessary, although the threat of potential intervention is likely healthy.<br/><br/>Why this is relevant is that there is some ability and incentive for other financial professionals and companies to create and maintain a healthy environment in their financial institutions for the benefit of all concerned.  This should be encouraged with the example set by the accountants in their running of FASB and GASB entitites.  Fianncial professionals need to be drawn in as part of the solution or they will remain central to the problem.", "recommendationCount": 5}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

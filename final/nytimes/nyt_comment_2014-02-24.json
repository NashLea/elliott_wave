I can normatively assume my home and my person to be under threat in that moment, and the superior to whom I might turn for relief is not immediately available.

Stand your ground laws turn the conventional self-defense provisions on their head by removing any kind of normative understanding of what constitutes an immediate threat and relieving the individual of the responsibility to appeal to the law, when it can \"interpose to secure my life,\" if need be.

It is subject to misuse and errors by juries, but it is not alone in the legal system as being subject to abuse.  The public has often expressed outrage at seemingly absurd use of insanity as a defense (particularly temporary insanity). Yet very few would want to see this defense totally eliminated because we know that there are certainly mentally disturbed individuals who should not be punished for terrible things they have done.  The law for many years has endorsed the principle that in the face of danger, a threatened individual should retreat rather than responding.  However it has always been a defense that the individual felt they could not retreat safely.  The Stand Your Ground is not significantly different .  It requires the accused to \"reasonably believe\" in the totality of all circumstances that he is faced with the threat of death or great bodily harm.  A jury of citizens must be convinced that those threats reasonably existed.  Juries make decisions like this frequently.   Because the two recent cases involved a white man causing the death of a black man, they have been sensitive.  However juries make decisions where black men are found not guilty of charges of killing white men and other black men.  In an ideal where public crimes violence are absent, the Stand Your Ground defense would not be necessary.

People who enjoy great privilege flatter themselves that they deserve it.

He and his bully buddies held the boy down and cut his hair. In a school that prided itself on discipline, Romney suffered no reproach - let alone expulsion. A few months later the boy he bullied was caught with a cigarette and immediately expelled. Romney was coddled through the privilege of being his father's son, the governor's son. <br/><br/>Did Romney say to himself, \"Gee, my family connections saved me from being expelled?\" I seriously doubt it. He thought it was a big joke. He was, and is, entitled to special treatment, but not because of his genetics. No, he is special because of his social and economic capital. <br/><br/>Right now, the population is questioning the privilege that money conveys. Therefore, the time is right for another apologist to come out of academia to reassure us that the privileged deserve their protected status. The rest of us, you see, just don't have the right stuff.

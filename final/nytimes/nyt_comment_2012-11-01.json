They have asked Romney to come to Freeport, but so far he has not responded.  Why should he?  In a prospectus from his company, Bain touted investments in China because of labor costs 85% lower than in the U.S.<br/><br/>Bain, of course, is only one vulture capitalist looking to profit from cheap labor in China.  Outsourcing American jobs to foreign countries has been all too familiar in recent years.  The rationale for it is cheaper production, which is supposed to translate to more affordable consumer goods.  Sometimes it actually does, but the profit incentive is to take manufacturing to places of cheap labor, but keep the sales price just as high.<br/><br/>A case in point is the Vise-Grip Company of Dewitt, Nebraska, founded by a local blacksmith in the 1920s and eventually employing more than half of the town's 600 residents.  Vise-Grip was sold to Rubbermaid, which closed the Dewitt factory in 2008 and now makes these handy locking pliers in China.  (Chinese companies were already making knock-off copies of Vise-Grips that sold for little more than $2 in the U.S. compared to $12 for the genuine Vise-Grip.)

Nate gives Romney a 21% chance of winning.  If I had a 21% chance of winning the lottery, I'd buy a ticket and at least start shopping for things in my mind.

I was wearing sandals and sloppy cut-off jeans. A woman in business attire who had walked by on her way for take-out was making her return to the building next to the wall I was sitting on. She struck up a brief conversation with me about the weather, which was finally nice. In the course of chatting, I told her that I was enjoying the wonderful day despite not having a job at the moment. One thing led to the other, and it turned out she was one of 4 people who had recently started up a small business in the same general business as the job I had recently quit. She said they needed someone else to do the lower-level work and would I come upstairs and meet the other 3 people? I mentioned my sloppy attire and she said not to worry, she'd explain. An hour later I had the job, and and I worked there for about a year and gained a ton of valuable experience, and they in turn valued my work ethic.<br/>I miss those days.

GCMs do not reproduce natural over-year fluctuations and, generally, underestimate the variance and the Hurst coefficient of the observed series. Even worse, when the GCM time series imply a Hurst coefficient greater than 0.5, this results from a monotonic trend, whereas in historical data the high values of the Hurst coefficient are a result of large-scale over-year fluctuations (i.e. successions of upward and downward \"trends\". The huge negative values of coefficients of efficiency show that model predictions are much poorer than an elementary prediction based on the time average. This makes future climate projections at the examined locations not credible. Whether or not this conclusion extends to other locations requires expansion of the study, which we have planned. However, the poor GCM performance in all eight locations examined in this study allows little hope, if any. An argument that the poor performance applies merely to the point basis of our comparison, whereas aggregation at large spatial scales would show that GCM outputs are credible, is an unproved conjecture and, in our opinion, a false one.\"<br /><br />I can provide quite a few more examples as to studies which question the attribution conclusions summarized by Dr. Hegerl.<br /><br />Roy can also provide results from his studies that illustrate a much larger natural variability in global average radiative forcing than concluded in the IPCC report.<br /><br />Let me know if you need further feedback.<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br />Roger Sr.<br />", "recommendationCount": 30}, {"assetID": 1147316, "replies": [], "lft": 48, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/world/asia/10pstan.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1545555, "rgt": 49, "userDisplayName": "sampath", "createDate": "1265777565", "userID": 10813017, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1265779345", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "india", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1265779345", "commentSequence": 22, "commentBody": "This is deja vous all over again!

Neville Chamberlain didn't do so with Nazi Germany and over 20 million people died in WW II as a result. With nuclear weapons in the mix, the results will be far more terrible if the US and NATO do not wake up to the fact that it is Pakistan's nurturing of terrorists and terror leaders that is the problem, and that this is not a problem that the US / NATO can solve just by fixing the symptoms in Afghanistan - rather than addressing the root causes that remain firmly entrenched within the Pakistani establishment.", "recommendationCount": 47}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

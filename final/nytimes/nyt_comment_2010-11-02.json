A significant percentage of Brady's interceptions over the past two years were throws intended for Moss. The Pats were moving their offense away from Randy even before he shot his way out of town.<br /><br />Part of that de-emphasis was because the team wanted to return to its short-pass, West-Coast offense that didn't focus on long-ball receivers like Moss. Part of that change also was due to Randy's declining effectiveness.<br /><br />Maybe Moss has just fallen into the bad habits of quitting when jammed hard at the line and tuning out of the game when he is not the focus of the offense. Maybe his physical skills are dropping off the table now. But he sure hasn't been much of a receiver this season.<br /><br />Don't count on Moss teaming up with Bill and Tom again.

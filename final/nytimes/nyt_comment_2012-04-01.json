In both of those areas, individuals are unable to shop around for the best price. Conversely, the areas where individuals can shop around tends to be on things like preventive care, which we actually want to encourage more of, not less.  Finally, having individuals operating in the private insurance market means more money devoted to administrative costs, advertising, and profit margins. <br/><br/>By contrast, government insurance programs are able to help hold down costs, because they have lower administrative costs and they aren't seeking a profit. In addition, government is able to negotiate for lower prices and to implement comparative effectiveness programs that help ensure that health care dollars are going towards treatments that are effective, rather than just ones that are well-advertised.  <br/><br/>The above reasons are why Medicare has held costs down better than private insurance. The key moving forward is expanding Medicare, and enhancing its ability to rationalize health care spending, rather than rationing care. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 40}, {"assetID": 3314160, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 5885241, "replies": [], "commentID": 5885531, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "inframan", "createDate": "1333261640", "userID": 58858097, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1333285515", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 6, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Martin Stein", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "pacific nw", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1333281915", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I got a copy of the 1st season of Californication from the library out of curiosity &amp; watched 1.5 episodes then took it back.

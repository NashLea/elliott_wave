That we may have some of the means to resolve some of these problems, the fact remains that society has ingrained a 'poor' element as necessary part or strata that the other parts benefit from. A 'limping' analogy might be made by saying that to legalize drugs would eliminate too many valuable jobs that focus on the  illegal  drug environment.

Or, were there really any sources, or more than one or two.  And what were the sources' motives for speaking to the authors, if indeed they did?  Who was getting even, grinding an axe, trying to cut down a past or future competitor, hitting back at a perceived enemy?  We'll never know, will we.<br /><br />One thing that sticks in my mind was a column by the Phila. Inquirer's Smerconish with Halperin, where he spoke about a 4 page \"verbatim transcript\" reporting of a conversation between Hilary Clinton and her chief campaign adviser (can't remember his name right now).  Halperin said, in the interview, that this was how two people privately talked to each other.  If it was just the two people talking to each other privately, how could there be a \"verbatim transcript\"?  Did Hilary Clinton exhibit perfect memory and speak to one of the authors?  Or the chief campaign adviser to whom she had been speaking privately, with no witnesses?  I tend to think not.<br /><br />From the excerpts and reports I have read, I think Game Change has about as much credibility as a made-for-TV docu-drama, where the writers decide what their characters might have, could have, should have said, or what the authors think is potentially the most sensational lines, that will garner the widest publicity and better sales.<br /><br />Yes, Harry Reid's apology gives a small bit of credibility, and Elizabeth Edwards' staff says yes, that may have happened but it is by no means the whole story.  As Hoyt points out, no one else has come forth to say yea or nay.  Which causes me to think that this book is just sensationalist fiction purporting to be \"reporting\" - and reporting is just exactly what it is not.<br /><br />I think the NYT made the right decision.  I do know that any time I read something by either author in TIME Magazine (where Halperin frequently appears) or any other publication, I will add more than the usual grains of salt.  At this point neither of them has any credibility with me.

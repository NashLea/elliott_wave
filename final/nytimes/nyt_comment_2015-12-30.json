This is nothing new. Remember those 90% marginal rates that everyone swore were so high in the 50s and 60s? Deductions and credits at such high rates led directly to the alternate minimum tax as a way to stop \"too many\" deductions. So much for progressive tax code. That did not work either.<br/>2. The founding fathers understood how corruption would impact government revenues. In fact, they were very worried about the arbitrary takings of the monarchy, forced loans, and \"taxes\" designed to eliminate wealthy competition. They responded by ensuring that all taxes had to be proportional to ensure levies were uniform on all people. They were so worried about an inequitable tax code that they wrote this into the Constitution.<br/>3. FDR broke this proportional tax base and passed the income tax by focusing on the wealthy. It was never supposed to hit the middle class. It was focused on breaking up the obscene wealth of the Guilded Age. Sure enough, government grew and it now hits the middle class. Even in Europe, the middle class pays the majority of the taxes despite \"progressive\" claims of superior tax codes.<br/>In the end, we ignored the sage advice of those that experienced arbitrary taxes and confiscation, and we now have a terrible tax system gamed by the very people it was instituted to tax.

That's because too many of our guys are just dumb and don't have minimum self control.

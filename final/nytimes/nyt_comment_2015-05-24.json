It is not the direct worship of money.  It instead points to the worship of the accumulation of money.  The quest of obtaining riches is what is viewed as holy.<br/><br/>Our society has adopted a new religion, the worship of wealth accumulation. Wealth accumulation has supplanted some ancient need for royalty, for tribal chiefs.  We place these people on pedestals and look up to them as if they were special, or have special powers and therefore deserve special treatment.  We don't question how they made the money or what they do with it.  We just believe that since they have it, they must deserve enhanced treatment.<br/><br/>This worship forms the catalyst for behavioral relativity.  Whatever they have, or have been paid, their morality is not in question because someone else has received more.  The doing is not questioned.  Only the being matters and that is being super rich.<br/><br/>We treat market capitalism as if it were a divine calling.  Making money is a holy quest.  But capitalism is inherently amoral.  Business has no conscience.  This forms the basis of a social contradiction.<br/><br/>This contradiction drives the kinds of people that run for public office and the reasons why we vote for them.

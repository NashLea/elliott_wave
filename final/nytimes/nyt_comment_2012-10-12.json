GMO seeds drift under real world conditions, but when that drift occurs, not only is the alternative contaminated and ruined - and prevented from being able to sue Monsanto for damages caused by their seeds - the victims of this contamination are subsequently sued for patent infringement and forced to pay royalties for having GMOs found in their harvest. In South America, where the amounts are in the billions for royalties imposed on unwitting victims of contamination alone, this is known as the \"Monsanto Tax\".<br/><br/>The other factor is that GMOs are in a losing arms race with evolution. Many GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides. But natural selection has been evolving superbugs resistant to the pesticides Monsanto sells along with their seed. Thus more pesticides need to be used to have an effect, increasing the amount of pesticides in the food supply. Eventually they will be useless and the pesticide resistant GMOs will be pointless, yet pervasive if contamination is allowed to continue unchecked.<br/><br/>Farmers could be forced to continuously pay royalties on a GMO with no lasting practical benefit.", "recommendationCount": 62}, {"assetID": 3343061, "replies": [], "lft": 937, "assetURL": "http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/oct-10-is-romney-leading-right-now/", "parentID": 7358516, "commentID": 7359440, "rgt": 938, "userDisplayName": "Tom Gavin", "createDate": "1350014584", "userID": 66077929, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1350015391", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Phila.

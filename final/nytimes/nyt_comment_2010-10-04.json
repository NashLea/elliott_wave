For example, in Virginia there are no such things as bars. There are only restaurants and restaurants that are licensed to sell alcohol. The later is considered a \"bar\".<br />Entering a \"bar\" in one of these states might juts mean getting a bite to eat at a place that also might have beer on the menu.<br /><br />Now, having laws for allowing law-abiding concealed carry pistol permit holders to be allowed to enter these \"bars\" has implications that might not be readily apparent to people who have never owned a firearm. For one, you don't have to leave your gun (or have anyone notice) in the trunk/glove box of your car if you want to meet friends for dinner. Many a firearm have been stolen from cars. Also, there's also the potential for a negligent discharge when handling a firearm when it is not in its holster. Thus, it safer to leave you pistol in its holster, on your body, and go about your day.<br /><br />Alas, just as the ignorant masses predicted \"blood in the streets\" over parking spaced when Florida became the first \"Shall Issue\" state, so are the same ignorant masses proclaiming the same will happen now.<br /><br /> ", "recommendationCount": 32}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

A nice picture of the NYTimes readership opinions, but I don't think you represent the ones who supported the war in Iraq and now in Afganistan and the next  one somewhere in Africa.

We Americans have yet to suffer enough to summon a democratic majority to aggressively find other ways  to heal wounds, other than with a fist to the face. It is still just too much part of our heritage to wait for a few moments and then seek a physical, forced resolution.  I could see that leading up to the Iraq war. President Bush had only so much \"patience\" once he committed the money to haul the troops and equipment over there. Did anyone doubt that once that process was started there was no turning back? But then was the press even aware that a line had already been crossed? One poster points out the grief displayed by President Obama over 4 soldiers. Hell, look how many die because of DUI in one year.

I don't see this kind of explosion of will power in my lifetime. BUT, because of my religious convictions, I know this will eventually occur, if not first in the US then in other countries. And then in that future time a collective majority will override the selfish interests of the status quo to  will renovate the UN structure with its Security Council strangle hold on real peace. Then, only after that has happened and places like the US, China, Russia, etc. are forced to follow along, will we have the first stage of a truly world-wide political peace.

There have been lots of excellent movies, but all of them have been about War -- any war -- not about THIS war.<br /><br />Specifically, none of them touch on the question of whether we (America) are doing the right thing to pursue these wars.  None of them raise the issue of whether our military leaders are immoral for fighting what most people believe to be unjust wars (Blood for Oil etc).  The only one that I can remember raising the issue at all was incomprehensible (Syriana).<br /><br />There has been little glorification of war itself -- most of the films are of the War is Hell variety.  But the major issues of the sixties and seventies, and 2001 and the following decade have almost never surfaced in film.<br /><br />Why is this?  Partly because the older Hollywood managers and viewers regarded WWII as a good war, and assumed that ANY war fought by America must be a good war.  The book An Empire of Their Own, about the founders of the major Hollywood studios that flourished until about 1975 is enlightening.<br /><br />So the movies do not challenge the naked aggression caused by the influence of money in Washington.  Watch the AOE1776 episodes on YouTube to see how it works.<br /><br />One of the greatest chances in a hundred years to speak out against American militarism was misused by director Francis Coppola.  After his Godfather films, the world was watching intently to see his Vietnam war film, Apocalypse Now.  And did that turn out to be either a robust statement in favor or against our invasion of Vietnam?  No, it was a story about a psychotic soldier in a remote jungle location.  It could have been set in any war, good or bad.  War is hell.<br /><br />The movies have a strong influence on people's beliefs.  And they have failed to speak about the real drama in regard to our recent wars.  I have long thought that the politicians and the generals were cowards, and I have reluctantly added the movie producers to the list.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.realamerica.webs.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.realamerica.webs.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 29}, {"assetID": 1229300, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/cut-the-war-film-some-slack/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1659634, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "lioneljl", "createDate": "1267857186", "userID": 27224182, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267858293", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Camden Maine", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267858293", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "The basest distortion of these \"gritty\" war films is belied by statistics.

In the past few years, I have become a very light sleeper so inconsistent sounds will keep me awake.  In the middle of winter, I have to turn on the air conditioning to drone out my fianc\u00e9\u2019s snoring.  I have noticed on these occasions, when I do get to sleep, I dream about people who I haven't thought of in months/years, but people who have caused me some sort of anquish and in these dreams, these people are normally in some sort of a predicament.

I worked Saturday and Sunday night, with Monday and Tuesday as my days off.

I find the interesting thing about hypnogogic (or hypnagogic) images is the associated sense of meaning, which vanishes immediately if you pop up enough in your level of consciousness to examine them. But almost always, they seem to mean something, often something profound.  I suppose it is a spurious sense of meaning, but what if it isn't? What if you really are tracking a profound thought that you just lose as soon as you are conscious enough to examine it?<br /><br />I am interested too in the various methods people have for trying to lull themselves to sleep. For me, sometimes simple meditation works; but when I am anxious then I find mentally repeating, slowly, Psalm 23 from beginning to end is amazingly effectual.

I assume you are already using pain killers, but they do not seem to work very well now. This might be able to help you somehow...<br /><br />Pain is a reaction of our body to let us know something's wrong, and we usually tend to suppress it with painkillers, and when it does not work, we try to ignore it. However, according to buddhist meditation practices, it is precisely when we try to ignore a pain that it becomes more intense, since it is trying harder to send us a message that something's wrong.<br /><br />Therefore, one surprising way to reduce the pain is to actually stay with it, be present with it. You could try to visualize it, talk to it, describe it in words, as kindly as possible. Do it over several minutes, or as long as needed, using a variety of words, anything that comes to your mind to be present with it, like you would do with an old friend. By acknowledging its presence, you send the message that you have understood what your body is trying to tell you and the pain becomes more acceptable, and in some cases, it might simply disappear.<br /><br />I am practicing this for headaches for example, and it works really well. I have seen people try it with success in most cases. I broke my arm once during a trip overseas and had to sit in a plane for 15 hours, with my arm in a sling, without a cast. This practice helped me get through it.<br /><br />I don't know if it will work for your acute condition, but if at all possible, you might want to give it a try...", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

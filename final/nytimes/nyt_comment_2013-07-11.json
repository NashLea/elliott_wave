Both are damaged by scandal. When discovered Weiner lied and tried to cover up and cling to office. Spitzer acknowledged blame, appoligized to his wife and family and immediately resigned from office. In public office Spitzer  was competent and relentless in pursuing the public interest while Weiner had little or no influence, was not marked as a leader in the party and was marked by fiery political speeches and ambition for higher office.  No matter who is mayor if Spitzer is comptroller he would be that person to prevent disaster.<br/><br/>I believe in forgiveness and second chances  in sex scandals except where force or workplace influence is involved. Some things I do not forgive: theft,  as we are seeing in Virginia, bribe taking, betrayal of the public trust. No second chances for that. But once a sex scandal breaks and reporters are asking questions, differences in people\u2019s  character show as they did between Spitzer whose  was quick and honorable and Weiner which was not. Of course Weiner\u2019s transgression was so tacky,  as was his explanation. He hit the send button in error. When I get in the voting booth to send someone to Gracy Mansion, there are 2 that I will not push the send button for and Weiner is one and the other also is a big mouth  hot tempered screamer.

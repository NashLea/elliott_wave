Especially the ones accusing Dr. Chua of \"child abuse\".<br />My siblings and I were raised by \"tiger parents\". Of course there were some differences, but from what I have read, the environment in which we were raised was very similar to that of the tiger moms. My parents set very high standards and had high expectations for us. Although we were allowed to participate in sports and extracurricular activities, we had to earn the grades to join. We were allowed to have and go to sleepovers, but not before we practiced the piano or did extra homework. While our friends were sleeping in until noon on summer days, my siblings and I were forced to wake up at 8 am to study up on the academic courses we would be taking in the upcoming school year. Only after we had spent the morning studying were we allowed to meet up and play with our friends. My parents were very critical of bad grades and we were grounded or our allowance was withheld for anything less than an \"A\". Looking back at it now, I laugh out loud. Did we miss out on anything? No! We just had to work extra harder for the privilege to do them. Would I cry and ask repeatedly to go to the bathroom to avoid studying and playing the piano? Yes. Were there fights, crying and accusations of \"I can't believe you're making me do this! You're the worst parent in the world!\"? Of course, but I don't know a single teenager who hasn't had these confrontations with their parents. The results? We were wrestlers and volleyball players with good grades. Members of the pep squad and the debate team who could also play the piano and the violin. And now we are (in my opinion) successful professionals who are thankful for having loving parents who believed in us and weren't afraid to put in the extra work it took to challenge us to expect better from ourselves.<br />I am not arguing that this is the best way to raise successful children. The term \"success\" is so subjective. I just wish for readers to keep an open mind. Balanced with love and kindness, this method does not necessarily produce \"emotionally damaged, mindless robots\".<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 16}, {"assetID": 2301543, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/us/15medical.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3237487, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Mike", "createDate": "1295063911", "userID": 9333216, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295070392", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Peterborough, NH", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295248166", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Certainly, the citizens of the city of Tucson came through as they worked so hard to rescue the victims of this senseless crime.

A circular rim experiences the least wear of all possible shapes.  Any covers with corners will abrade and wear most at the corners until they ultimately become circles.  By the same token, a manhole port having the shape of a circle will experience the least local stress and be less likely to crack, as at a corner, as others have pointed out earlier.<br /><br />Another is symmetry.  In the absence of gravity (such as on the space shuttle) the reason for the shape now becomes one of convenience, and it is nice to be able to open and close a manhole port without having to orient the cover in any special direction.  This absence of a preferred direction argues for rotational symmetry, i.e., a circle.  Also pointed out by others.<br /><br />I'm also trying to work myself into the metaphysics of manholes.  The universe, so far as we know, has no preferred orientation or helicity, so the four-dimensional space-time equivalent of a manhole is probably a 3-dimensional sphere in 4-dimensional hyperspace, much as the ordiinary manhole is a 2-dimensional circle in 3-dimensional real world space.<br /><br />Well, if, after all that,  Gary Antonick comes up with a totally different and new answer, it sure had better be a doozy.  It is now midnight and I am going to bed.  I'll try not to count sheep jumping into manholes.  :)<br /><br />PS:  This reminds me of the story of a little child learning about areas of circles from her father.  \"No, daddy,\" she protested, \"pies are round!\"<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2543831, "replies": [], "lft": 92, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/numberplay-manhole/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3578784, "rgt": 93, "userDisplayName": "Dr W", "createDate": "1300853740", "userID": 28699930, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1300853905", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1300850305", "commentSequence": 43, "commentBody": "Just one more:  if yu want a working manhole without a flange and also workable without gravity, you want a disc to screw into the manhole.

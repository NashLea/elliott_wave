But I for one am glad that we haven't given Canadians a vote in American elections. Israel and Switzerland both have armed citizenry because they are republics, where the people are the countries' sovereigns, not some old white lady living in a castle at the government's expense outside of the country that has her as its sovereign, such as Canada. There is a big difference between you Canadian subjects of a foreign sovereign and we American citizens who are the sovereign of our government.<br />You Canadians have features of government that are repugnant to our Constitution and intolerable to free Americans, such as an appointed Senate and a British appointed Governor-General, guided by the principles of colonial legislation which created Canada---- the British North America Act's peace, order, and good government, which stand in contrast to our guiding American principles: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness!<br />Yes, we have problems associated with our right to own a gun. The first is that we emphasize the wrong end of regulation. We strictly regulate the right to own a gun, but we loosely regulate the responsibility of how, where, and when we have permission to use a gun (unlike Switzerland and Israel, which require rigorous training and group oversight of any owner of a gun). We need to require gun owners to demonstrate physical, psychological and personal responsibility in gun safety as a prerequisite of gun ownership, so that we might weed out the emotionally dangerous and irresponsible gun owners before they harm innocent people. We need to strictly regulate when and where guns may be used. I doubt that Rep. Gifford employed any armed security personnel at the time she was shot. And there are no reports of other people in attendance at her last fateful meeting who were armed with guns, other than the assailant presently charged with the shooting.<br />An armed responsible supporter of Gifford might have been able to stop the shooter and might well have reduced the number of fatalities and injured at her meeting.  We obviously can't allow the Secret Service to protect Congressional Representatives as they do the President and his senior officials. But there ought to be nothing to stop a Congressional Representative from using some of his or her administrative budget to hire armed security guards at public meetings.

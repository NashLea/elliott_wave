Owning a home outright isn't going to compensate for long stretches of unemployment/underemployment.  In fact, it's more likely to tie you to one place, so you lose out on job opportunities that may exist elsewhere.  I know people who bought before the housing bubble burst, and now they are stuck with those houses; because they owe more than the houses are now worth, they would have to come up with tens of thousands of dollars in cash to be able to sell them.  <br/><br/>And forget refinancing in our 30s and 40s, a lot of us are getting our first mortgages at that time.  Most people I know are getting married in their late-twenties to mid-thirties, and then buying together.  That's what I did.  My husband and I are fortunately not under water (thanks to a hefty down payment, and regularly paying more than what's due), but after nearly 8 years, it would be nice to have some equity in the place.<br/><br/>Part of our anxiety as thirty-somethings is knowing that we can only save so much, can only plan for so many problems.  Ultimately, if we get hit with a long stretch of unemployment or a serious illness, we won't be able to recover financially.  The opportunities and safety nets just aren't there.

Romney is not the moderate that he pretended to be in Massachusetts.  And he may not actually be the rabidly reactionary conservative he played in the primaries.  Instead, Romney is a candidate who lacks any core values, principles, or beliefs and, therefore, will do say or do anything if he thinks it will win him votes, even if it is the exact opposite of what he said or did the day before. <br/><br/>In normal times, having such an empty cipher might be merely disappointing. But these are not normal times. Instead, these are times when our nation faces major issues about war, jobs, social issues, and deficits, yet one of the two major political parties - the GOP - has gone completely off the rails. <br/><br/>To date, our nation has been largely shielded by President Obama from the harm that could be caused by the wingnuts who have overtaken the GOP.  But if Romney were to become President, he has shown he would be entirely unable to stand up to these same wingnuts. Romney had a chance to stand up for the rational, reality based conservatism of his father's GOP, but he didn't. Instead, Romney joined the crazy and cheerleaded it on.

He asked if he was a cancer survivor even though he didn't go through chemo or radiation as it doesn't respond to either. He actually felt guilty about this.  He is very good at math and statistics and states statistics related to his potential for death.  It is a real problem for him to deal with.  As a Mom my instinct is to protect and I know God will be with him always and you too.  Trust him and call on him for strength and protection when its rough.  He will help you.   I believe God to be the best chance of survival no matter what.  He just wants to get on with his life, when he has applied for jobs and explains his break in employment they don't ever call him back.

But I bow to no one in my opposition to Likud, AIPAC, and the Shel Adelson-style rich American right-wing Jewish hyper-Zionists and neocon war-mongers who lied us into Iraq to \"protect\" Israel (and weakened Israel radically in the event) and who now want to shove America into another proxy war to \"protect\" Israel in Iran. Having grown up a young white liberal in MLK's Atlanta, I especially admire any people who oppose \"their own people\" when \"their own people\" are oppressing others. So three cheers for all the majority of American Jews like Robert Bernstein, Don Goldstein above who stand, like the Israelis of B'eth Selem, in solidarity with the Palestinians and oppose their oppression by some of \"their own people.\" I hope that other mainline American Christian churches will follow the lead of the Presbyterians, which I fervently applaud. The more wake-up calls we can give Likud and its rabid American backers, the better for Israel, not to mention the Palestinians. Israel's treatment of the Palestinians and stone-walling on a two-state solution can not end well for Israeli Jews, especially in a Middle East that all of America's power is quite literally as helpless to control for Israel as it was to win a permanent \"victory\" in Iraq or Afghanistan.

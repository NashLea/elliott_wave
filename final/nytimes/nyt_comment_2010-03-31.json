Nothing good that I can figure.<br /><br />I understand that it was a reasonable experiment to try; the Mexican version has actually had quite a bit of success, but Mexico's culture is not New York's, and endemic poverty in Mexico has different causes.

Mothers gained influence over a family's finances when they had control of money of their own.<br /><br />I guess I just don't think that bribes are a good substitute for internal motivation, and the bribery tells people--poor and otherwise--who do the right things for their families because they know they're the right things to do that their efforts are just not valued.

(1) On his first encounter with the law, he accepted an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.  The government agreed not prosecute him and he agreed to forego a trial to which he was entitled.  Thus, he was never given his day in court and was never found guilty of anything.  Yes, indeed, the case against him was dismissed in its entirety.  (2) When the police find a marijuana cigarette in your pocket (as Nina Bernstein reports occurred in this case) THIS IS NOT A CRIME IN NEW YORK.  The New York legislature has decreed that simple possession of less than 25 grams or less of marijuana is a violation and not a crime.  As a violation it is akin to other violations such as not properly sorting your recyclables. For your first offense the fine is set by statute at $100.  That's $15 less than parking in violation of alternate side of the street parking regulations south of 96th Street.<br /><br />So before you are all so quick to castigate this man for \"breaking the law\", remember that certain parking offenses are misdemeanors in Laramie, Wyoming and that New York feels that simple possession of marijuana is not even a crime and the punishment is less than that for forgeting to move your car for street cleaning.<br /><br />Why should the federal government so disrespect the judgments of our state legislatures and courts and allow a federal administrative law judge in Harlingen, Texas, decide whether a New Yorker who never has been convicted of a crime in this country is a recidivist felon by Harlingen, Texas's brand of federal law.

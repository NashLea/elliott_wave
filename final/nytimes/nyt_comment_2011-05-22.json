Assuming a mix of federal and private loans, graduating students will be left with a monthly payment of ~ $1,500 - $2,000. <br/><br/>For state universities the situation is different. However it's much more likely that a student will take 5 or more years to graduate (the majority do). Debt payments for the more expensive state schools (assuming in-state tuition) will be ~ $800 a month. <br/><br/>The debt levels are crippling! Yes on paper the graduating student earns more money but not necessarily in practice. Also note: Student loans are almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy.

I booked myself and my cat's tiokets several months ahead, checked the airline website as well as regulations for bringing a pet to France (and bringing her back to Canada), talked to the vet a couple of times - who warned against sedatives because my cat could get sick from them. I was more concerned about how she was going to make it through getting to the airport 3 hours ahead (which turned out to be totally unnecessary), sitting on a plane for 8 hours (she would hates being in her carrier), and then the 4.5 hr drive from Paris to my home. And of course the usual nightmare of going thru security at CDG.<br/>\nNone of my fears was realized! My cat was a perfect traveller (a little whiny but not as much as the screeching babies on board). I did take her to the toilet on the plane a couple of times so I could pet and reassure her. French customs oohed and ahhed over her (and didn't even ask for her documents), and we both made it to my home with no \"accidents\" and in good spirits!

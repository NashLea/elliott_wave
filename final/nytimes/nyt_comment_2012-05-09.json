(I'd skipped several grades + was a PT home schooler with few non-ballet friends, so used to hide in my school's library between classes or during assemblies where I'd frequently replicate entire idolized Sendak books with a sharpened #2.) He surprisingly always reciprocated with a friendly smile as he ballpoint-penned or sharpied wild dancing beasties on treasured white paper dinner napkins. What a marvelous sport.<br/><br/>After retiring from a professional classical ballet career at 21, I became an illustrator/art director. Sendak definitely influenced this shift.<br/><br/>Ironically a mere 3 weeks ago my inner 'waltz of the wallflowers' resurfaced at a speaking event on memory. \"I, uh...haven't asked for a signature since requesting Maurice Sendak's as a child!\" I blurted to Joshua Foer of 'Moonwalking with Einstein' fame. \"Mine's the copy full of nerdy bookmarks.\" (An adjacently seated Nobel laureate chuckled as I rouged.) I then audibly hissssed (think Zach Galifianakis' \"gay snake\") in reaction to learning that Joshua owns a Kindle. Naturally I was mortified and fled as quickly as possible.

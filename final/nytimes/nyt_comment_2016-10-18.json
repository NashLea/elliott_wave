I'd like to see a study done on the equity markets to see how many companies are currently listed on the U.S. exchanges, and how that's changed over the last 20-30 years.

I don't follow the markets and individual companies as closely as I used to when I was an analyst, but my understanding is now we are also seeing a lot more evidence than in the past of companies appearing to have EPS growth that is manipulated by share buybacks or some other factor, which is deceiving because it isn't growing a company organically.  With a low interest rate environment, money is naturally going to flow into equity markets, private equity, alternative asset classes, foreign markets (although risky - lot of countries slowing down and not as transparent as need be without following GAAP).

Having read a few of the emails where she discusses China, they seem reasonable enough. She talks about balance of power, etc.<br/><br/>But at her core, she is a loyal servant of power. And apparently an effective one. What does that mean? It means that primarily, she does the bidding of those in power\u2014older wealthy capitalistic,white men. Men on a power trip that doesn\u2019t consider anything but leveraging their power over the world and ignoring most basic human considerations. Men of the New American Century, and also Democrats like Obama and Kerry.<br/><br/>Is this what feminists are admiring in her?

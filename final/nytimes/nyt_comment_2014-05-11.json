They are defined more by what they are against than anything good that they are for. The list is significant: <br/><br/>The Church is against gay rights, gay marriage, and homosexuality. They are against abortion, contraception, and equal rights for women, both within the Church (nuns can't be ordained) and outside (women are subordinate to men). The Church tolerated and protected pedophile priests for decades, and was slow to make amends and was inept when they did so.<br/><br/>The Church's positions are out of touch with the current world. They have lost membership in 1st world countries, but have made inroads in bigoted, sexist and homophobic African and South American countries.<br/><br/>The private church, the personal church, the millions of decent Catholics who help others, use birth control and ignore much of the official Church, may have some, even a lot, of goodness.

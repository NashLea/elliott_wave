Paul Ryan got lots of press talking about privatizing and voucherizing Medicare, Medicaid, keeping the tax breaks for zillionaires, etc. Now that Ryan has laid this giant stinking egg of a deficit reduction proposal on the public -- about 98.9 percent of whom are counting on getting Medicare after age 65 -- it's starting to sink in.

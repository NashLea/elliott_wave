The current air campaign to deflate IS command and control and train the Iraq military to stand up and fight is the appropriate approach. More US military on the ground generates more cash for local tribal leaders and politicians who have proven to be untrustworthy and self-serving - i.e.) Maliki. The merger of interest between the Egyptian terrorist faction and IS should put the Egyptian military on notice. Since they own most of the big cash flow enterprises in Egypt they have a vested interest in controlling free milk from the cow spilling into the hands of the zealots. Since there are great schisms between sectarian groups within the Middle East it would be difficult for them to form one big Caliphate in the absence of a  monopoly over the cash flow. I suspect Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the front man for a band of thieves creaming off the oil revenues.

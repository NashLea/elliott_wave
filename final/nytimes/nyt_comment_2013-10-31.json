I can testify that the best doctors, either STEM or liberal arts, have a broad exposure in college and life. It has NOTHING to do with your major in college. Heck I got my A's in liberal arts classes to raise my GPA in college b/c those hard-core sciences were so tough!<br/><br/>But I knew plenty of liberal arts majors without jobs. So what happened to those kids who couldn't get into med school after those 4  years? Your self-selection bias and self-preservation can't explain why students are getting smarter about spending 200k on a liberal arts college degree. We obviously need more STEM majors, otherwise why we are giving away too many foreign worker visas to foreign computer programers while our liberal arts major children are slaving away at low-paying \"internships\" and Starbucks after college? That's so wrong! Let's hire Americans to do American jobs. <br/><br/>I say if you want to increase American exposure to liberal arts, make students take more required liberal arts classes to graduate. But to tell them to become philosophy majors without a prospect for jobs is both cruel and a burden to our society who needs more engineers and scientists.

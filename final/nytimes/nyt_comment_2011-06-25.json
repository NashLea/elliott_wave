The mummery only makes any sense to those who already DO believe.  To a nonbeliever, it's just ancient claptrap.<br/><br/>Using mummery to prove the \"truth\" of mummery is essentially an act of irrationality.  People think that all those \"thees and thous\" are awesome proof.   A REAL religion wouldn't need any mummery - \"holy writ\" - at ALL.  It could say all that really needs to be said in, maybe, two paragraphs.  If that much.  And there once WAS such a thing - it wasn't a religion, though, but a spirituality.  Which is worlds different from religions, which are constructs made by people who want a means of controlling vast numbers of people.  Spirituality didn't judge or moralize.  Those things were for humans to work out for themselves.  No \"holy writ,\" no judgment days or armageddons (i.e., raptures for sadists who want to watch people barbecued), no moralizing, no hierarchies and internal political setups.   And no proselytizing.  It lasted over 15,000 years, too.  It was very fulfilling and people were content with it.  Until a bunch of Hebrews decided they wanted a MALE god, instead of the Earth Mother.<br/><br/>What they did was to genocide believers in the Earth Mother, to stamp it out.  They almost succeeded.  They endowed their new god with male attributes - the ugly ones.  Their god was a god to FEAR.  The Earth Mother was a god to LOVE.  We can thank those Hebrews for royally messing up the world.<br/><br/>A god who is slathering to send people into a fiery pit is not exactly a loving god.   You can't have it both ways.  This particular god is more judgmental than I would ever be.  If I were a god, with all that omnipotence and omniscience, I wouldn't be sadistic the way this god is supposed to be.

Without Florida in the mix, Gore had more electoral votes than Bush, and that would have been enough.  By the same token, the Constitution specifically gives each state the right to choose its electors by whatever manner they wish.  Therefore, it was up to the Fla. legislature, or its Supreme Court, to make the ultimate decision on who, if anyone, got the states electoral votes.  If SCOTUS had actually read the Constitution instead of deciding to elect its preferred candidate, it would have declined to take Bush vs. Gore for lack of jurisdiction and let the state decide.  The fact that the Court said that its decision should not be regarded as precedent reveals clearly what was going on:  they wanted Bush, they ignored the Constitution to pick Bush, and that the decision was blatantly political, not judicial.  Yes, Bush vs. Gore ranks with Dred Scott, Plessy vs. Fergusion, and Korematsu as shameful monuments to  absurd legal reasoning and partisan politics disguised as judgement.

There is a right to bear arms as part of a regulated militia (e.g. police or army).  This right orginated (almost word for word) from the English Bill of Rights of 1689.  That right arose due to some groups being prohibited (on the basis of religion primarily) from joining the army and subsequent repression of those groups by the army.  In effect, the right to bears arms is a right to serve one's country.  The right was never associated with firearms or guns specifically.<br/><br/>This is reflected in many court judgements over many decades on the nature of the 2nd amendment.  In a complete break from precedent, in 2008 the supreme court came up with a completely new interpretation that the right was related to gun ownership.  This had never been its prior interpretation and the text of the new decision explicitly contradicts the wording of the amendment by saying the right to bear is in fact not related to militia at all.  Of course the NRA had been pushing this interpretation for a long time.

A few years ago I was working on a study about leadership in tough development contexts. The focal question was, What leadership is required to get things done. We looked at rapid results in Gashaki, Rwanda, as well as in Sierra Leone, Burundi and Kenya. In all places we saw the power of this method, which reinforces many of the central ideas about how change happens. We found that the people felt empowered, able to identify and address their problems, with a better understanding of the need to push past obstacles rather than give up in the face of such, and a belief that they and their organizations could do better. One man told me that rapid results taught him not to wait for the donors. \"I now know that I can be my own donor\" he said. We found that leadership solutions happen in rapid results through groups of people mobilized around problems, which was also important. This is not a 'big man theory' of change, or a top down 'implementation by edict' or an imposed dependence...this is an approach that has he real potential to transform people and communities...and countries.

Rodwell got to the ball first. He's supremely talented, but the meal Suarez made out of that challenge was an absolute disgrace, and he does it all...the...time.  guess it's taken a little time, but you've been vindicated about the warts showng on Charlie Adam. And King Kenny finally recognized that he should play Kuyt over Jordan Henderson. But Downing didn't do much on his shift out there. As soon as SG and Bellamy came on, Pool was another team entirely, and had much more than their poor neighbors.<br/>\nAs for Inter, Obi's first challenge was very much like the Rodwell challenge, but he got the ball and hooked it away, and was booked. But he had the chance to play with caution once booked, which was denied to Rodwell. It was a professional foul that dismissed Obi on his second yellow, but the push from behind was clearly outside the box, and the Napoli man staggered like a drunk heading for the last bus in Dublin (where I was an exchange student, and did it myself many times...) before falling comically. I guess since he was on a card, it WAS a dismissal, but never a PK.<br/>\nTDK might want to weigh in on Inter's complete capitulaton. First question I have, is Sneijder hurt, or is he just pouting? Inter has Forlan, Pazzini and Zarate to attack. They never should look as bereft of attackng ideas as they did, particularly in the second half. TDK was spot on-the best attacks were from Maicon, Lucio and, to a lesser extent, Zanetti. That midfield was overwhelmed by Napoli. Before Juve got two late to beat Milan, I was looking at the table, amazed to see, before Juve leapt top, Udinese, Palermo, Napoli and Cagliari. And Atalanta would be tied there, had they not been deducted sx points for the fixing charges. Cold sweat on both sides of Milan. Early on, Napoli looks the most complete side. Don't discount Mascara, who was the best player and captain of Catania the last few years and is a very good player, particularly off the bench.

Now in both of those matches, the better side went on to win, but not without considerable help from the referees with dismal performances. At Goodison Park, Martin Atkinson dismissed Jack Rodwell for a tackle that wasn't even a foul, probably based upon Luis Suarez' spectacular embellishment. Liverpool probably would have won anyway, but they DID leave it late, and on a hot day, the decision reduced Everton's abilty to do more than draw.<br/>\nIn Milan, Signor Rocchi cautoned Joel Obi on a challenge similar to the 'foul' that got Rodwell dismissed, then had no choice but to send him off for a professsional fould later, but he took a foul clearly outside the box, and allowed the embellishment of a staggering, falling player influence him to call a penalty.\r<br/><br/>As for your Forrest Gump reference, the book is VERY different from the movie, but maybe the book's first line sentiments are more applicable to today's troubled referees: \"Let me say this: Bein a idiot is no box of chocolates.\"", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3283405, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/in-britain-n-f-l-s-rooney-rule-is-seen-as-model-for-hiring-minority-coaches/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4625076, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Paul", "createDate": "1317613759", "userID": 34677113, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1317622917", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bellerose Terrace", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1317619317", "commentSequence": 20, "commentBody": "The NFL was integrated long before many other sporting outlets were in the US, particularly big time college sports n the American South. In 1966, an all white team from basketball power University of Kentucky (and its racist coach, Adolph Rupp) were beaten in the NCAA final by 5 black New Yorker starters of Texas Western (now UTEP-Texas @ El Paso), which Kentucky took, um, badly. Even later than that, football legend Bear Bryant intentionally schedlued a home game against integrated USC. USC's star running back Sam (Bam) Cunninham led a 28-0 rout that allowed Bryant to convince Alabamians that they had to integrate in order to compete. These events were well AFTER the Civil Rights Act which you trumpet so much.<br/>\nThe REASON why the Rooney Rule was developed was that, unlike on-field performance, team management is NOT a mertiocracy, and while every other element of the NFL, from the officials to the traning staff to the players were integrated (even quarterback, the last position bastion of white preference), the place where it just didn't happen was in coachng. This situation is still utterly, painfully true n England. The same old coaches keep getting recycled over and over again. Why has Steve Bruce gotten chance after chance to underachieve at Birmingham, at Wigan and now at Sunderland n the same period when his Man Utd teammate Paul Ince has gotten one, and only one, chance to climb the coaching ladder? Can you honestly say that Bruce knows that much more about how to run a team than Ince does? Pshaw. When Sparky Hughes walked away from Fulham (and HE got chance after chance at Blackburn, Man City and then Fulham), Fayed chose the ultimate recycling project, Martin Jol, because everybody saw how GREAT he was at Spurs, then at Hamburg, then at Ajax, right? And there are dozens of these recycled coaches around England. Me? I'd like to see a few black officials. They can't be worse than Martin Atkinson was at Goodison.

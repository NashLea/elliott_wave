We are trending to no snowpack in the winter in Calif and this represents 30% of future water storage during spring melt off. So right there we are down 30%, we are rapidly draining the subsurface water that is left. Yes conservation can help a bit, but exactly where are we going to make the difference up year after year? Desalinaton simply wont work THe one being built in Carlsbad is costing over 1 billion and will provide 18% of water needed in san diego county. Do for san diego we need to build at least 6 more and then we need to build hundreds and hundreds more all over the state. They use an incredible amt of energy and do environmental damage, so we are just escalating our ecological problems and speeding up the global warming process even more. No, we cant  build a  water pipeline from the great lakes to Calif nor from Canada to Calif..........not feasible nor would either probably agree to giving their water over........I cant imagine the thousands and thousands of upscale people in LA and SF doing the sacrifice needed to conserve water in the extreme month after month, year after year.

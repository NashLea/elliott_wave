Like many who fell into trouble, when my husband lost his job, and I could not support a family of four on a museum salary, we began using credit cards for the most basic of needs; groceries, etc. When it became clear that this situation was getting out of control (living paycheck to paycheck, late payments were an unfortunate occurance, with the attending fees, and rising interest rates) I somehow heard about a nonprofit credit counseling agency. After close to three hours with them on the phone, reviewing everything from expenses, income, habits, etc. a plan was made. I was told that my creditors would have to approve. It was made clear to me that I would pay one sum a month, which would in turn be paid off to the various creditors. I still bore a responsibility to review statements, and of course, make sure my payments were made. And while my monthly payments altogether probably only dropped about 10% from what I was paying to the cards independently, the interest rate for all went from over 20% to about 6%. Thus, we will have all of our credit cards paid off within three years. I cannot explain the relief I feel upon reviewing the card statements each month and see that the total due is, indeed, diminishing, and that we will be debt free by 2013.<br />I imagine there are many like me, who wish to make good on outstanding debt.

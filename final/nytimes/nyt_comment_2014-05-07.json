Smaller cars started showing up more, people drove slower - trying to conserve fuel and money.  Now, everyone is back to their former speeds driving pickups and huge SUV's.  Despite the fact it would hurt me personally (long commute, no public transit, but a very efficient car), I think the gas tax should be increased by a dollar - use the added revenue for improved infrastructure (failing bridges anyone?) which would also create jobs.

American exceptionalism, don't see that anywhere else in the world.<br/><br/>Every day in my quiet, safe cul de sac neighborhood, a whole fleet of 2 ton SUVs fire up, drive about 4 or 5 houses down the block, idle for 10 minutes or so, disgorge one tiny child each for the school bus and motor back home. <br/><br/>And then there is the other half of America, driving comfortable, fuel efficient cars to work, walking their kids to the bus and in more fortunate communities, jumping on a train to cross town. <br/><br/>Half of the US is spending many thousands a year for gas and payments on monster vehicles, often adding to debt and stealing from the future.

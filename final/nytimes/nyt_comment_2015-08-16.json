He is who he is, and it is very entertaining to listen to him. He is not crazy, although he loves to play one on TV. He is far more alert and intelligent than George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, so the country cannot do worse under his leadership than it did under those two Republican presidents! I liked what The Donald had to say about Vice President Biden (a loyal man). I enjoyed his reaction to George Will's article about him - I too have always considered Mr. Will a pompous ass who has great facility with the English language and possesses a phenomenal memory; a man who uses those great gifts in the service of misleading his unsuspecting readers about really important social and political matters. Good thing The Donald now feels free to attack Mr. Will.<br/>     All in all, Trump represents a good fraction of the electorate. We are better off seeing clearly what this group of voters think, than to bury our heads in the sand and pretend that these people (with their outrageous mode of \"thinking\" and \"reasoning\") do not exist. Thank you, Mr. Trump, for exposing the know-nothing wing of the Republican Party. It is sad to think that this is the Party whose first president was the unrivaled Abraham Lincoln.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 3435748, "replies": [], "lft": 556, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/introducing-donald-trump-diplomat.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 15797730, "rgt": 557, "userDisplayName": "rjd", "createDate": "1439669125", "userID": 41232513, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1439700731", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "nyc", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1439697131", "commentSequence": 15797730, "commentBody": "One thing is for sure.......the American people are totally fed up with our run of the mill politicians from both Parties.

An unabashed Capitalist vs. an avowed Socialist in a titanic struggle for the Presidency and the future direction of the Country.<br/>Can't happen? When you look at and listen to both of the presumptive front runners like Hillary &amp; Jeb you just want to turn off the TV. Both are complete utter yawns and relics of the past.  Both are drenched in payola money along with boatloads of excessive political baggage.

Good questions, Mr. Overbye, One thing I understand: a possible delay of Higgs mechanism/boson discrovery because of cancellation of the US supercollider.<br/><br/>That is not a difficult scientific concept, just politics. As a former scientist I understand the 'urgency' to solve major problems in all scientific fields. A balance, however, has to be maintained. Currently I do not see any truly urgent issues that had to be solved as soon as possible (in basic science, applied sciences like medicine are something else).<br/><br/>There is plenty of time to clarify the issue of Higgs mechanism and boson. Similarly, there is plenty of time to travel to Mars and beyond - our Sun is going to be a good neighbor for several billions of years.

That's the problem with ruthless workaholics in charge of any system. You can get the same social contract under communism, fascism, theocracies, military dictatorships, democracies... and I can assure you that there are many companies with this attitude toward work and their employees whose overlords have absolutely no chance of being considered libertarians, and would be outraged to get the label.<br/><br/>And none of these people would say that luck is involved. Service to the company, duty to the fatherland, exalting only in god, in it to win it, whatever.

However, in order for these price margins to dilate two things must happen:  First, some consumption must be foregone so that a greater savings rate causes interest rates to fall and, second, consumer prices must be allowed to fall in consequence of that abstention.  Only if both of these criteria are met, and they are met if the supply of money remains stable throughout, will the supply side become more capitalized and land and labour not now required to supply that amount of consumption set aside will be redeployed in early B2B where price margins are most favorable.<br/><br/>However, if a central bank guided by Keynes attempts to reflate consumer prices to gain a trade-off with re-employment of involuntary labour, the rational basis for the inducement to invest in early B2B is taken away.  So yes, if you want the central bank to interfere in the price level, all is left is some irrational motivation you call the confidence fairy. but this is like shooting a runner in the foot and then claiming he has no motivation to win.

Despite all of the tragic stories like Paula Coopers--told and untold--our criminal justice system continually balks at the most effective and humane methods of reducing crime. We too often extol the deterrent qualities of the prison atmosphere, the isolation, the violence. Indeed, it is a hellish environment that would repulse anyone. But the very things that are heralded as disincentives to criminal behavior are those which also exacerbate the mental illnesses that lead one to behave criminally.<br/>Sweeping reforms of this system are some of the steepest uphill battles because the ones we are fighting for are those who've hurt us in the past. For many, it is difficult to exercise compassion for a person they see as a monster, a threat--to someone like Bill Pelke, a perpetrator. But through the grace of his grandmother he was able to see that all of us have troubles, some more than others, and all of us need love and support; the most troubled among us deserve that help more than any.<br/>Sadly, I think it will take a nation of Bill Pelkes to cause any substantive change. I hope that, with the help of people like you, who are the voice of the voiceless, we can someday reform the system in a way that digs to the roots of an individual's behavior to help them heal from the bottom up, and the inside out.

Also in November 2008, my \"Self-Directed Roth Individual Retirement Account\" which I named (unimaginatively) S-D RIRA sought to move money from its account in California to purchase land in Georgia. The Federal Government BLOCKED the wire transfer of the closing funds for 3 days so that they could confirm that S-D RIRA did no mean \"Sean and David's Irish Republican Army.\" That is what the banker told me when I inquired as to why the delay in the wire transfer of MY money.<br/><br/>If some govt. agency weren't spying how did they put those two pieces of info together and how in the world would the Feds even possible consider that my S-D IRA might have ANYTHING to do with the Irish Republic Army? I'm not Irish American... I have no history of communicating with ANY terrorist organization. <br/><br/>The scales have tipped, sir, and not in favor of law-abiding private citizens.

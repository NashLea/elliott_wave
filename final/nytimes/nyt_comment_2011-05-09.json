The one thing I would add is that this failure to realize that it is the elites that have gotten us into our economic mess is also preventing us from solving the economic problems right now. <br/><br/>A case in point is unemployment. Tens of millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans remain invisible to our conservative elites in politics and the media, even while those same conservative elites continue to cower in fear of invisible bond vigilantes and inflation monsters hiding under their beds.  <br/><br/>    The biggest economic problem facing our country right now is undoubtedly high unemployment and low growth.  While there has been some positive job growth in the past few months, unemployment is at 9%, and underemployment is over 15%.  Initial jobless claims were 472,000 last week, the highest they have been since August 2010.  And millions more people have dropped out of the labor market altogether, with our employment to population ration at 58.4%, the lowest it has been since 1983 and far below the 62-64% that it had been for years before the Bush Recession.<br/><br/>    Given these circumstances, voters have made clear in poll after poll after poll that jobs are their biggest priority.  And in November 2010, voters registered their anger about joblessness, voting out Democrats who had not created enough jobs (ignoring the fact that it was Republicans who had prevented them from doing so), and voting in Republicans who promised to focus on jobs.<br/><br/>    And what has the response to this situation and election results been?  For virtually everyone in D.C. to be obsessed with deficits, inflation, and bond vigilantes.  Never mind that voters do not identify the deficit as nearly their biggest concern, that the deficit is not a major threat to our economic stability, that the short term deficit is mostly caused by the joblessness and low economic growth that the Bush Recession brought us, that the spending cuts being proposed would destroy even more jobs, that inflation is non-existent, and that conservatives have been crying wolf about bond-vigilantes since the Bush Recession began.  Despite high unemployment and joblessness, Republicans in DC continue to focus on the deficit, inflation, and bond vigilantes, and Democrats feel they have to address those issue while ignoring the critical issues jobs and unemployment issues that the people want addressed.<br/><br/>    Our country\u2019s deficit, inflation, and bond vigilante hysteria and refusal to address a real unemployment problem has nothing to do with our politicians being too responsive to the views of the American people and has everything to do with them being too responsive to the billionaires that bankroll them.

Obama's job creation initiatives were much too weak, scuttled by the fear of deficits which results from the mainstream economists not understanding basic accounting.<br/><br/>99% of economists fail to understand the importance of private debt - that is why they failed to foresee the crisis which resulted from the private sector going too much in debt (this is how all bubbles pop, and mainstream economists are caught by surprise each time). On the other hand, most mainstreamers agonize about the public debt which is always a much smaller problem.<br/><br/>The mainstream consensus is that we need to fear the public debt because it is \"like a household debt, only bigger\". In fact, it is OPPOSITE to a household debt: without federal IOUs (dollars, bonds) the public would have NO net savings! I can have a deposit in the bank, but this is bank's liability. To hold savings in aggregate, the private sector needs to hold IOUs of someone outside it. This someone is the government issuing its IOUs. Private net savings is holding government debt (dollars, bonds). No federal debt, no net savings for the private sector.<br/><br/>Imagine a Monopoly game. The central banker wants to \"be responsible\" and run a surplus - take in more dollars than he emits, thus siphoning off the players' savings. The game will stall. This \"plan\" is backed by neoliberal theories that defy basic accounting. That is America's \"plan for prosperity\". Give me a break.<br/><br/>One more thing: the US if off the gold standard. Gold could run out, but now the US creates money as needed with each payment. If you are thinking \"what about inflation?!\" - you are right. The only problem can be too much money (inflation), but the government cannot possibly run out of dollars, like a bowling alley cannot run out of points. So much for US \"going bankrupt\". US can create inflation, but not go bankrupt, ever.

US could pay zero in interest if it wanted too: simply issue currency and not interest-bearing bonds (unlike Greece or Portugal, the US issues the currency it pays with, think Japan instead: 200% debt/GDP and low interest rates. The mainstream doesn't understand the difference between Japan and Greece). And if you heard that issuing currency without bonds is more inflationary, it is because the mainstream never bothered to look at the accounting. Look at agents' balance sheets.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2009/11/what-if-government-j\" title=\"http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2009/11/what-if-government-j\" target=\"_blank\">http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2009/11/what-if-government-j</a>...<br/><br/>We should ask pundits from both sides:<br/><br/>Do you understand why paying off public debt each time resulted in a depression?

These powerful people are not known for their self-reflective abilities. The trouble is that they are as hooked on money and power as any hardcore drug addict.\r<br/><br/>As portrayed in the film \"Inside Job\", neuroscientists have discovered through MRI technology that the desire for ever more money stimulates the same part of the brain as cocaine. Likewise, withdrawal or threatened withdrawal of riches  or drugs stimulates panic and a rise in blood pressure. No wonder the top one per cent of the owners of a third of all the wealth tremble at the thought of having to pay more taxes. Their greed and constant Wall Street casino overdosing through all the past years of government deregulation have only left them wanting more and more. Enough is just never enough.\r<br/><br/>Research has consistently shown that vast wealth does not make a person happier. But the banksters and the corporate titans have not come to terms with the fact that their reckless self-engorgement can only cause another epic financial explosion sooner rather than later.\r<br/><br/>Our government officials and both political parties have been complicit enablers of these monsters of greed.

Oil and farm subsidies should stop cold turkey. Bin Laden is dead, so let's wind down the useless Afghanistan War. These steps will go a long way toward curing the almighty deficit. Money will come pouring into the Treasury to fund infrastructure and provide all those jobs. And the uber-wealthy will realize they should have gotten with the program a long time ago.

Even Mr. Krugman spent most of his column fixing the blame, but offered little insight into potential solutions. It is clearly in the interest of the Republican Party to avoid doing anything that will serve to improve the economy. Not if they continue to pursue their main objective, which is not to help us out of the recession, but to insure that Obama will be a one term president. Concomitantly, just about everyone is pandering to the Tea party's naive belief that it's all about reducing the size of government and, coincidentally any and all give-a-ways, aka social programs.

The elites, as you imply, are not into navel-gazing. By virtue of their self-defined status, they can do no wrong. It wasn't long after Alan Greenspan testified that he was \"shocked, shocked\" that banksters didn't behave in the best interests of their stockholders that he began writing papers explaining what other people did wrong. No mention of what he did wrong. Which was plenty.<br/><br/>After the housing bubble burst, ordinary homeowners were blamed for causing the crash by being greedy and taking on more mortgage than they could handle. Never mind that banks and realtors were convincing them they could afford those huge loans. The banksters and their enablers used every means of subterfuge they could muster -- and they mustered quite a few -- to persuade people they were qualified and able to handle the loans that today are underwater, in foreclosure or forfeited. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Republican Senators (Jon Kyl comes to mind) took to blaming people for being \"lazy\" to explain why millions were out of work -- and as an excuse not to extend unemployment benefits. Just this past week the Florida legislature cut our state's unemployment benefits by eleven percent. And -- no surprise here -- Gov. Rick Scott is expected to sign it. Yay! Some of those \"lazy\" people are sure to get back to work now. <br/><br/>The whole theme -- of which President Obama is the designated huckster -- that \"just as families need to tighten their belts, so does Washington\" is nonsense. Families \"tighten their belts\" because they already have as much income as they can make (which they get, if they're \"lucky,\" by running themselves ragged holding down more than one job). But the federal government -- despite what President Obama &amp; other elites tell you -- is not like a family. It can easily bring in more revenue; we usually call those taxes. And those families at the top, who are NOT doing any belt-tightening, are the obvious major source of that extra government income. Unfortunately, that potential source is also the very same gang of elites who are paying the water-carriers in Washington secret retainers not to touch their fat incomes. <br/><br/>I got a kick out of last week's Washington Post editorial on what to do about the pressing problem that non-elite Americans face -- joblessness. Here's the crux of the Post's best advice:<br/><br/>\"The costs, human and economic, of high unemployment are heartbreaking. But it will take a measure of patience as well as a sense of urgency to prevent it from becoming a permanent feature of the U.S. economic landscape.\"<br/><br/>That's right, folks. Hurry up and be patient! Those are the words of wisdom the Beltway elites have for the rest of us: keep on being chumps because we know best. And we are telling you unwashed masses there's nothing we can do.<br/><br/>Public opinion polls aren't enough to shake the faith of the elites in their own wisdom. It's time for masses of plain people to march on Washington and establish a new Hooverville on the Mall. Maybe then the elites who dash past on their way to the the Hill and the White House would notice us.<br/><br/>The Constant Weader at <a href=\"http://www.RealityChex.com\" title=\"www.RealityChex.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.RealityChex.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 1032}, {"assetID": 2710959, "replies": [], "lft": 38, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/opinion/09krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3798489, "rgt": 39, "userDisplayName": "walterrhett", "createDate": "1304906536", "userID": 33605332, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304913730", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Charleston, SC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304961321", "commentSequence": 13, "commentBody": "The Bush tax cuts were supposed to be a simple case of \u201cwe can't miss what we don't have.\u201d Then it became a winked-at-pretense that cuts have no costs or budget impact, except to affirm our national soverenity (leaving out at the expense of our national welfare). Then it became a cat and mouse game of attaching the cuts to illusive job growth, then delays because of poor timing, and then turning American expectionalism into American entitlements for the wealthy.

Why do Republicans gain popular support?<br/><br/>One insight points out how those who bring good news are often accused of bringing bad news. Because the good news depends on bad things no one wants to hear about in the first place!<br/><br/>Those who vote Republican often make up their minds before the fact. Stubbornly entrenched, Republican voters are motivated by concerns they see as legitimate, and central to their actions is fear. Fear of the country collapsing, fear of their rights being denied (to guns, to legitimacy, to being validated), of their pockets being squeezed, except they shift blame based on foregone conclusions rather than facts. They simply don\u2019t trust those who don\u2019t share their fears.<br/><br/>You can\u2019t win these Republican voters over with the promise of good news. They reject every promise if it doesn\u2019t involve blame. So when House and Senate Republican shout mistated facts, their supporters see courage to confront fear, never mind the truth.

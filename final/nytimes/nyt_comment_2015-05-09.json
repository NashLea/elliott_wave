Only the Civil War interrupted. Later that century, intense pressure was brought on the Mormon Church to stop polygamy, an order that has been kinda sorta obeyed.

They are forever insecure, and not because their brigades kept getting their butts kicked in the Civil War. No, it's because the Comanches pushed the border back east in the 1830's, and Texans nad to live in the San Antonio enclaves. Meanwhile, Comanches controlled the trade routes to Santa Fe, sacking Texas settlements that interfered, including taking their women.  It was the only state that was defeated by a single tribe, and Texans weren't left in peace until Sam Houston signed a treaty with the Comanches in the 1840's.<br/><br/>Texas is a wannabe country filled with macho fantasists. California schools even manhandled their vaunted high school football teams.

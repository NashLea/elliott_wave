I have a feeling that many of the Times readers would find a traditional second line memorial to be fairly distasteful.  On paper, the concept of a second line sounds crass. In reality, though, when it's done properly it's a beautiful thing,  fun and tender and profound.  So perhaps a \"seated funeral\" has something to offer as a way of memorializing a loved one that we don't see when reading an article. I'm reserving judgement until I get invited to my first \"seated funeral\". Seeing as there have only been three so far in New Orleans, it's likely to be a long wait.

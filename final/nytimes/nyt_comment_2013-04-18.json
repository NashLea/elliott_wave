They have not been peer- reviewed or been subject to the review by the NBER Board of Directors that accompanies official NBER publications.\"<br/>It is further stated on the NBER website that \"NBER Working Papers ... are intended to make results of NBER research available to other economists in preliminary form to encourage discussion and suggestions for revision before publication.\"<br/>So it is obvious to anyone who looks into the matter that the paper was originally presented as not being in final  form and was not really \"published\" (making me wonder how many of the people who quoted it actually looked at it).  Nevertheless, it was treated as a formally published paper by those who liked the results and by the authors themselves once they got favorable press.  This is not just sloppy data handling and questionable weightings, it is a misrepresentation of the paper itself as being a formal publication rather than a preliminary draft."}]}, "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/a-history-of-oopsies-in-economic-studies/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8791778, "rgt": 19, "userDisplayName": "seth", "createDate": "1366251621", "userID": 58197034, "replyCount": 3, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1366259204", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "CT", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1366255604", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "The RR paper in question here was not peer reviewed.

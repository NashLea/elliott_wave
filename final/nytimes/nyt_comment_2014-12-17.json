But there is something very strange about the simultaneous fall of oil and the Ruble against the US Dollar (USD):<br/><br/>Back in June 2014, oil was at $115 per barrel and the Ruble was steady at 35 Rubles per USD. (R/USD)<br/><br/>So for each barrel of oil, Russia was receiving 115 X 35 R/USD, or 4,025 Rubles per barrel.<br/><br/>Fast forward to Dec 15, 2014:<br/><br/>Now, oil has fallen to $55 a barrel, and we see from this article that the Ruble has fallen to 80 per USD.  I saw a sign that said 85 R/ USD, but I\u2019ll use 80.<br/><br/>So now, for each barrel of oil, Russia gets 55 X 80 R/USD, or 4,400 Rubles per barrel!<br/><br/>IF my calculator is correct, 4,400 Rubles is about 9 (nine) per cent MORE Rubles per barrel than Russia was getting 6 months ago!<br/><br/>Of course, that is NOT all that is going on.  Still, I have to ask: \u201cWhat is wrong with this picture?\u201d<br/><br/>Contrast 2014 with the 1980s, when the Ruble was fixed at 6 (six) Rubles/USD.    So, in 1985, when the U.S. caused the Saudis to cut oil production by 2 million Barrels Per Day, oil \u201ctanked\u201d from $30 to $10.   (Nov. 1985 to Feb. 1986).  By Dec. 1991, when the Soviet Union Collapsed, oil had only recovered to about $16.90 per barrel.<br/><br/>In the 1980s, the Ruble stayed at 6 R/USD, so when oil fell in USD, it fell in Rubles as well.<br/><br/>I believe by 1991, the Ruble at fallen to about 31 R/USD, if memory serves.  <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/rdelrosso2001\" title=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/rdelrosso2001\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/rdelrosso2001</a> ", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3417880, "replies": [], "lft": 731, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/russia-ruble-interest-rates.html", "parentID": 13608879, "commentID": 13609465, "rgt": 732, "userDisplayName": "joftoronto", "createDate": "1418792367", "userID": 66364854, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1418792741", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Toronto", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1418792741", "commentSequence": 13609465, "commentBody": "David: the majority of your comments indicate that you would be feeling good about Russia and Putin's place in its history if you were Czar Nicholas facing the firing squad in Yekaterinburg July 1918.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 3417852, "replies": [], "lft": 139, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/magazine/off-target-on-toy-gun-regulation.html", "parentID": 13605135, "commentID": 13607997, "rgt": 140, "userDisplayName": "sammy zoso", "createDate": "1418772616", "userID": 58556387, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1418792747", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1418792747", "commentSequence": 13607997, "commentBody": "You're right but these are different times my friend.

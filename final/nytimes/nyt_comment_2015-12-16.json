They had a huge emergency room visit cost for being suborn and cheap. If they were in getting x-rays they woudl have seen that there was tumor on my Dad's jaw. No he has never smoked or chewed. So ya... get x-rays, don't be cheap with your help and don't imprint your opinions on others in a way that could cause them harm.

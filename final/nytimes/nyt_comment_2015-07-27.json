Here's why all this matters. Climate science is the investigation phase of an action. That action is mitigation and adaptation. We know mitigation is simply to stop emitting lots and lots of GHG. Adaptation is going to involve infrastructure builds and is going to be expensive as hell. Climate science is really just the establishment of physical conditions, both baseline and projected, for construction and operations of public and private endeavors. It has to be pretty darn right. Climate science isn't the end all. It's the first deliverable.<br/><br/>The Army Corps of Engineers will be the ones having to modify, retrofit and rebuild coastal facilities for military and commerce. It will be essential for physical conditions to be well agreed upon before spending billions on a build.

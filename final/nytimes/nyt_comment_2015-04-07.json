Most of the Republicans haven't read the agreement with Iran, and most of those who might have read it don't understand it. <br/><br/>Tonight Energy Secretary Moniz, himself a Ph.D. nuclear scientist, gave one of the most cogent reports on the Iran agreement on the Rachel Maddow Show. It was patently clear that this agreement is brutally stringent on Iran. It embodies, in fact, the most stringent inspections regime in history. <br/><br/>However, it doesn't do the impossible--it doesn't completely dismantle Iran's 40 year old nuclear program. <br/><br/>Why? Because Iran is signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that gives them the \"inalienable right\" to peaceful nuclear development. Iran has compromised, but it is too much to ask Iran to humiliate itself by giving up its treaty rights. Iranians have an enormous amount of pride in their scientific and engineering skills. Iran would be the only nation out of 200+ NPT signatories to be forced to totally give up its nuclear technology. It is simply too much to ask. <br/><br/>However indifferent the Republicans might be to the reality of the Iranian situation, they are sure of one bit of humiliation they want to inflict--that is humiliation heaped on President Obama. No deal would ever be good enough for them. They want to see President Obama brought low and ground in the dust--more than they wish this for Iran.

The American Psychologist is the most rigorously reviewed journal in the United States.  Reviewers blind to the author's identity are assigned to review the article - months, sometimes years, in advance of publication.  These reviewers are selected because they are expert researchers in their field - in this case psychotherapy research.  I know this particular article when through a number of revisions before the journal editors and reviewers were satisifed with the accuracy of the research and the conclusions drawn.  As individuals, these reviewers and editors are not obliged to agree with the conclusions or theoretical orientation represented in the article - but they are ethically bound to ensure that the research conducted was accurately represented and interpreted. Naturally, being a reputable academic journal, The American Psychologist also later published a critique of Shedler's work by authors of alternative theories.

It's not that straightforward. Yes, providers are cautious about being evaluated, but there are some good reasons for that. The field is in early stages of developing empirical methods for evaluating provider effectiveness. It's moving slowly, but it's still moving in the right direction.<br/><br/>1) As a field, we're still in the early stages of evaluating how best to measure change during psychotherapy. Our measures are self-report, and contain a fair amount of error and user-bias. <br/><br/>2) Some clinicians take on case loads with different levels of severity. Should those who take on more difficult patients be held to the same standard as those with more straightforward cases? Of course not. However, the field is still in early stages of adopting methods that account for differences in case load. <br/><br/>3) We ARE starting to evaluate clinicians. For a great summary of many of the tools developed for doing so, look to Michael Barkham, Gillian Hardy, and John Mellor-Clark's book Developing and Delivering Practice-Based Evidence: A Guide for the Psychological Therapies. They cover many of the repeated-measure tools currently being used in daily practice. <br/><br/>Look to work on Therapist-Effects by Paul Crits-Christoph, Bruce Wampold and David Kraus for examples of research examining the impact of the person of the therapist on treatment outcomes. The work is being done, and the field will change over time. It's important that there be skeptics, who hold the research to a high standard."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 8640843, "replies": [], "commentID": 8645618, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Abdul", "createDate": "1364578843", "userID": 61010038, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1364581928", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 1, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Dan", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1364578328", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "In the spirit of the article, please prove yourself.

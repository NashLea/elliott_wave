Is it possible though that the reason they're not is just that they (ie, men) don't want to be married at all?  Marriage is a high-risk behavior for men.  Like owning and riding a motorcycle?  Not quite.  But being married places men in a very explicit legal risk that was not an issue until divorce became a lot easier and judges decided to clobber men in the process by awarding/rewarding women for divorce by trucking huge amts of men's earned assets and income over to them even if they never worked a day outside the house.  Marriage simply is a far less attractive proposition for many men these days, whether they have college degrees and/or make a lot of bank or not.<br/><br/>I wonder with all the ppl quoted in this article, has anyone actually tried to engage the kind of men they're concerned with (I imagine, 20-30 year-old single men) and actually *ask* them where they're at with this topic?

Kimmel and Fallon offer a hipper and younger form of comedy--I think they are both equally talented in their own unique way.  While I don't underestimate the importance of delivering jokes with great timing, let's not forget the voices behind every late night host: the writers and producers--these are the real foundation for any successful show. <br/><br/>I would be very worried if I were NBC.  The replacement of Leno with Fallon is going to alienate a huge chunk of the loyal and mostly older Tonight Show audience.  The fragmentation of television viewing accelerates each year. Content competition from cable and  watching programs on a plethora of new tech devices and from new sources like the web are making live television viewing nearly as obsolete as VCRs.

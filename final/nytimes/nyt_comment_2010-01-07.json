The attempted christmas day attack would not have ocurred in the first place if pentagon did not sponser a deadly air raid in Yemen no less than a week before the incident. Yemen special forces used US fighter planes and logistical information to attack a potential Al Qaeda member. In that raid 82 civilians were killed and more than 213 were injured. Most of them were women and children from the nomad community in the district. This was the first attack of its kind in yemen, a very unneccessary one. The US persuaded the Yemeny government in going thru with the attack by feeding them unaccounted information that Al Qaeda was targeting the presidents family members.<br />Freedom House recently noted Yemen as among the world\u2019s most corrupt developing nations. With the personal interests of the ruling elite taking priority over national development. Nearly half of Yemeni children are malnourished and out of school. Unemployment is extremely high and medical services scarce. A looming water crisis continues to threatens to destabilize the country. Claims of development are little more than government propaganda (managed by US consulting firms). Year after year the gap between the extremely rich and the extremely poor widens.<br />Yemen has been a failed government ever since the US started sponsering the government under Ali Abdullah Saleh... it led to the unification of North &amp; South Yemen. In 2009 it has been ranked 154/180 on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. There is a movement in South Yemen as well as a separate one in North Yemen that seeks to overthrow the corrupt regime under President Ali Abdullah Saleh. A \"democratically elected\" president who made sure his family members and son will forever run the nation. The presence of Al Qaeda is extremely small and poses no eminent threat to US or Yemeni interest. By sponsering the corrupt Yemeni government we are suppressing these legitimate reform/resistance movements... the same type of movements we failed to back up in Iraq after the first gulf war, the same type of movements that we're pushing for in Iran now (while endorsing sanctions and non-stop war mongering). This type of foreign policy is turning into a deadly norm, not to the US citizens but to those people who truly strugle to live in a free society of their own.

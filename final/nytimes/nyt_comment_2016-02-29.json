This seems much too limited a view of the real world. \"Objectivity\" is only knowable through the subjectivity of the individual. At the same time, \"subjectivity\" is governed by universal truths, whether we are aware of them or not.<br/><br/>I would think that what is most problematic is not increased \"objectivity\" but, rather, the confusion of \"objectivity\" and \"subjectivity\" or, perhaps, the cloaking of subjectivity in the mantle of objectivity. It has become common to to take claims of hope, fear, belief, and faith and state them as facts, as objective truths. We see this not merely in the current political environment but also in everyday life in such \"controversies\" as vaccines and anthropogenic global warming. <br/><br/>In a previous age, science had to be cloaked in faith.

It's simple math: if money is drained out of the demand system by people who don't spend (i.e., billionaires and sub-billionaires), it won't be spent on demand and demand will be reduced.

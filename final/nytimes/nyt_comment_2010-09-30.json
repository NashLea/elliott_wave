How could they have possibly predicted their actions could have led to Mr. Clementi's death? One cant draw a direct draw a line from a) what they did to b) Clementi's suicide.

This situation just happened to have a sensational conclusion.<br /><br />\"When a sin is not forgiven, it requires punishment, it cries to people or to God for punishment; but when a sin cries for punishment, it looks entirely different, much greater than when the same sin is forgiven. Is this merely an optical illusion? No, it is actually so. To use an inadequate metaphor, it is no optical illusion that the wound that looked so appalling looks much less appalling the moment the physician has washed and taken care of it, and yet it is the same wound.

I've been sensing this for a number of years now. Despite the overall crime rate being down, our society has become coarser in a number of respects. You see it on the road, in the anger I've sensed in peoples conversations with one another, ( that is when they are actually speaking to one another!), and in the day to day observations I have seen on the street, and in a number of venues I participate in. This negative atmosphere has filtered down to our young people, who in many instances lack the role models they once looked to. On top of this, the current media goes out of its' way to find instances where people are behaving in an obnoxious manner, and by highlighting it, such things are becoming more of the accepted norm. I was very concerned a number of years back, when the series \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" became popular, creating in peoples minds, that if they didn't possess the material things, they would be deemed lacking. This was followed by that \"Show me the Money' phrase which became ubiquitous from the Tom Cruise movie, it flowed from. Put all these things together, and you come up with a new generation influenced, not by the lofty ideals of our historic, which in many ways helped build character, Judaic-Christian roots, but rather values which would always lead to an empty fortress, and a banal existence. Sure it's important to put an emphasis on math and science, and having a job, but if we forget our humanity, indeed our historic civilty, what kind of country and people will we become? Till we start emphasizing the social sciences, since we don't have the stability of the family anymore, we will only head to the same fate that Rome encountered! This was a tragedy.

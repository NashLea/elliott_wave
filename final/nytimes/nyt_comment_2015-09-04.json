What bothers many middle-class whites in America is to constantly be blamed for all of the problems of American blacks, a large proportion of whom consistently behave in ways that are less healthy, less smart, and are often illegal. To convince white America that blacks have their own interests at heart, blacks need to stop doing so many felonious criminal activities, stop killing each other in disproportionately high numbers, stop looking for above-the-law treatment, and stop looking for entitlement rewards merely for being black. Many American whites have simply lost patience with entrenched bad behaviors by so many blacks as well as with their attitude that blacks be considered in a special category of Americans. These NY Times editorial board editorials only confirms and promote these exceptional expectations for the black population, and won't fly with many in America, who want to see more blacks helping themselves out with smart behaviors.

The amount of attention on social issues is not that large on the part of Obama. What attention is being paid is thoroughly justified. Conservatives love to downplay their actions on social issues as \"side issues\" - and then casually ram through or thwart legislation that has the effect of adding misery or repression in real people's lives. <br/><br/>Right-wing rich people and their apoplogists don't care if abortion is safe and legal, because they can always send their wives, daughters and mistresses to places where it is. In their network of gated communities, they can just ignore children suffering in poverty and invent stories about how the experience of hardship will build their character. They dont worry about being bankrupted by medical expenses.  And so on. <br/><br/>But this stuff matters. A just society offers more to its least fortunate than insulting lectures on what constitutes appropriate behaviors and values.

Thank you, Joe Biden, for forcing the President to \"come out\" with his beliefs, sooner than later.<br/><br/>As a gay man, it has made a huge difference to me - in how I see myself and in hope for a future in which sexual orientation will matter as little as eye color. Until now, I never thought that day might come.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you Joe for your support and affection."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 6193996, "replies": [], "commentID": 6195292, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Jim", "createDate": "1336912980", "userID": 15457179, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1336914053", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 4, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Bryan Barrett", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boynton Beach, Fl.", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1336910453", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Teddy didn't need a teleprompter- it was before TV- he just sat and read it.

Since President Teddy Roosevelt, few, other than Trueman perhaps, have done that act well. Somehow President Obama does not strike me as being successful, since that two hour speech pattern which Teddy reveled in, pre Teleprompter, could hardly be replicated, since our attention span has shrunken so much, and newspapers do not report verbatim any more.<br/><br/>Welcome back from France and surely you will have another interesting column on your predictions of how President Hollande will become the savior of the EU.

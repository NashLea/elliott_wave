True, those no longer able to work can file for disability, but that's a protracted process. Even disregarding the effect on the worker, disability claims are much more expensive for the government. If the retirement age goes up, disability claims will increase.

They become taxable income if total income exceeds a threshold. But that's been true for at least twenty years so obviously isn't what the means test advocates want. However if you really must means test benefits, making them taxable as income would seem to be the most cost effective way to do it. You could raise the tax rate or lower the threshold if you want to take benefits away from people with other means. But of course we must never talk about tax increases.

It's increased approximately 13 years since Social Security was instituted as part of the New Deal.  So increasing the age of eligibility is something that must be considered.  That some segments of the population are regressing in terms of longevity, namely those with very low economic situations and poor educations, but this is attributable to poor diet, poor lifestyle choices, and poor access to healthcare.  This illustrates the  critical importance of establishing the type of quality health care that the ACA means to provide to this population.  For as Prof Krugman is well aware, the costs of healthcare for treating chronically ill, poorly treated persons who present with the complications of their diseases - for example a stroke, heart attack, or kidney failure resulting from untreated hypertension - are astronomically higher than they would be if the disease were properly diagnosed, treated, and monitored earlier in that person's life.  Raising the eligibility age is just good common sense.  So is means testing.  And one thing should be instituted:  if  someone who is eligible for Medicare still has employer-provided health care, then they should required to take it.  Some kind of tax credit might be applied to offset the loss of this benefit, but Medicare - and Social Security for that matter - should be benefits provided to those who truly need them.

But in times of high inflation, which we had in the past and will surely have again, taxing \"gains\" is simple confiscation. Suppose you bought an investment in 1970 for $1,000 and sold it in 1980 for $10,000. You'd be taxed on $9,000 of \"gain\". But in fact, you made a loss, not a gain, because it would have cost you more than $10,000 in 1980 to buy the same goods that would have cost $1,000 in 1970.<br/>\nThe fair thing to do would be to tax the real gain (after allowing for inflation).

Most economists will say that, absent a desire to create an incentive, all income streams should have equivalent taxation.  You are not actually doing this for dividends because they are post corporate tax.  So, e.g., if my marginal tax rate is, say, 39% as the highest may soon be, and my company pays the corporate tax rate of 35%, the effective dividend tax is 60%. That creates a big incentive for companies to hold onto money they earn, even if the quality of reinvestment is poor, rather than giving it back to the shareholders. (Think lots of failed M&amp;A) Bad for business, bad for the country. Better to make the two streams equivalent, say by taking down the corporate tax rate to 25% (closer to international norm, so less hiding money abroad) but getting rid of the many loopholes that cause many businesses to pay a far lower rate today and then set the dividend rate to something that makes the total taxation equivalent to the income rate - abt 20% in the case of the 39% top income tax rate. (that's up from 15% today)<br/><br/>2. Then there is the question of whether we actually want to encourage investment by preferentially taxing cap gains and dividends?

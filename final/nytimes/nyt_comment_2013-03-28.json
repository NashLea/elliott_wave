The beauty of this is its open-endedness (the author doesn't start with any personal prejudices). <br/><br/>Roberts' piece starts with the premise that \"renewable energy\" is something we must pursue. Perhaps the reason you like Roberts' writing is because you agree with this premise. The article then purports to frame this as merely a question of \"willpower\" to achieve some arbitrary \"renewables goal\", without ever stopping to ask whether achieving a particular benchmark would have a measurable climatic effect.  <br/><br/>But it is actually rather silly to argue that one article is \"better\" than the other. They are not in competition nor are they direct parallels, despite the fact that both are efforts to move the discussion away from perpetual disagreement. <br/><br/>Conflating the effects of delay in a court case about human relationships in society with energy policy initiatives makes about as much sense as having Cypriot Bankers debate the merits of a head scarf ban as it relates to their current economic crisis. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, sometimes \"doing nothing\" is the best decision. <br/><br/>Before you get more speed, you need to know where you're headed and if it can make the trip.

He is asking can't we still get along together as friends even though we have disagreements on issues.  It is a pretty dumb piece because people can always agree to disagree to get along, but one or both of them are wrong so understanding is not advanced by dropping the topic.  Is one engaged in friendship or policy discussion on the opinion page of the NYT?<br/><br/>Roberts is focused on issues and finding ways to acknowledge the valid points on the other side.  And, he identifies a good one.  I have no problem acknowledging that technology will improve, for example.  I'm for more research funding.  I suspect that if we are going to draw lines between funding sources and funded efforts, it would be best to fund healthcare and veterans benefits with a surcharge on fossil fuels and energy research with a surcharge on nuclear power rather than some other proposed scheme.  <br/><br/>But the largest fastest cost reductions available for renewable energy come from deployment.  That is also the fastest path to lower energy costs generally since mined energy resources are already degrading.   So, realistically, more research is not all that important to costs over the next 20 or 30 years.  Scale is much more important and is needed much more urgently.

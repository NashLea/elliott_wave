But African Americans didn't contribute only in military service to victory.  As a 2011 article in the NTHP magazine says, \"Union generals and troops had realized from the beginning how African Americans in contraband camps could aid the war effort, especially by undertaking tasks white soldiers were loath to do. ... Women made significant contributions, growing cotton on abandoned plantations as part of a Union labor program, for example, or becoming cooks or hospital workers. And many runaways contributed valuable military intelligence, reporting on Confederate troop movements when they arrived at Union lines.\"   These were some of the support services to which I referred.  Also, such labor added to the Union cause was subtracted from the Confederate cause.  So historian Robert Engs has a point that the African American contribution was great and perhaps crucial.  It's also arguable that the African American exodus to freedom behind Union lines helped expand the focus of the war from saving the Union to ending slavery.  New perspectives don't necessarily equate with \"political correctness.\"  The site of Fort Monroe, incidentally, was where the first African captives were introduced into the English colonies in 1619.  Hence this site encapsulates the English/ U.S. history of slavery in America.

(Sorry, I don't have the reference readily available to cite.) Historically, if you look at Texas going back to the beginning of the 20th century, when it was still mainly a cattle raising/agricultural state, the wealth that exists there now was built with massive federal assistance, either directly or indirectly through laws that were passed. First, in the 19th and 20th centuries, came the railroads and then the \"land grant\" colleges. Then, rural electrification during the depression and beyond, followed by telephone service and Interstate highways starting in the 1950s. The oil depletion allowance, a massive tax break, also played a role in building wealth. Texans are by nature \"can do\" people who build on what is available, but the federal govt., much hated by millions across the state, provided the groundwork in many cases. The presence of many military bases and the Johnson Space Center also supported a lot of state residents and also gave rise to aerospace based industries.<br/><br/>In the lower tax and frequently southern states, the state legislatures cut benefits to the poor and the near poor and then take federal dollars to make up some of the difference.

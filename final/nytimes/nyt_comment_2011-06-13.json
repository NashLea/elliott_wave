In his 1928 essay, \"What is the Soul,\" available in full on the internet,  written with his usual stylish wit, he  said : \"When I was young we all knew, or thought we knew, that a man consists of a soul and a body; that the body is in time and space, but the soul is in time only. Whether the soul survives death was a matter as to which opinions might differ, but that there is a soul was thought to be indubitable.\"\r<br/><br/>Today most people are inclined to believe that a person is nothing more than the living human body - whereas for thousands of years - in so-called Western cultures at least, and at least since Plato - the true person was inside the living human body. \r<br/><br/>There's a memorable and rather amusing passage in Boswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" in which Johnson - whom many would consider a literary sage, even if not a philosopher - expatiates upon David Hume, who was one, and Hume's reputed attitude to his own death:\r<br/><br/>Here's it is, an entry for October 1769:\r<br/><br/>\"When we were alone, I introduced the subject of death, and endeavoured to maintain that the fear of it might be got over. I told him that David Hume said to me, he was no more uneasy to think he should NOT BE after this life, than that he HAD NOT BEEN before he began to exist. JOHNSON [in reply]. Sir, if he really thinks so, his perceptions are disturbed; he is mad: if he does not think so, he lies. He may tell you, he holds his finger in the flame of a candle, without feeling pain; would you believe him? When he dies, he at least gives up all he has.' BOSWELL. 'Foote, Sir, told me, that when he was very ill he was not afraid to die.' JOHNSON. 'It is not true, Sir. Hold a pistol to Foote's breast, or to Hume's breast, and threaten to kill them, and you'll see how they behave.' BOSWELL. 'But may we not fortify our minds for the approach of death?' Here I am sensible I was in the wrong, to bring before his view what he ever looked upon with horrour; for although when in a celestial frame, in his \"Vanity of Human Wishes\" he has supposed death to be 'kind Nature's signal for retreat,' from this state of being to 'a happier seat,' his thoughts upon this awful change were in general full of dismal apprehensions. His mind resembled the vast amphitheatre, the Colisaeum at Rome. In the centre stood his judgement, which, like a mighty gladiator, combated those apprehensions that, like the wild beasts of the Arena, were all around in cells, ready to be let out upon him. After a conflict, he drives them back into their dens; but not killing them, they were still assailing him. To my question, whether we might not fortify our minds for the approach of death, he answered, in a passion, 'No, Sir, let it alone. It matters not how a man dies, but how he lives. The act of dying is not of importance, it lasts so short a time.' He added, (with an earnest look,) 'A man knows it must be so, and submits. It will do him no good to whine.' \r<br/><br/>\"I attempted to continue the conversation. He was so provoked, that he said, 'Give us no more of this;' and was thrown into such a state of agitation, that he expressed himself in a way that alarmed and distressed me; shewed an impatience that I should leave him, and when I was going away, called to me sternly, 'Don't let us meet tomorrow.' \r<br/><br/>\"I went home exceedingly uneasy. All the harsh observations which I had ever heard made upon his character, crowded into my mind; and I seemed to myself like the man who had put his head into the lion's mouth a great many times with perfect safety, but at last had it bit off. \"\r<br/><br/>What is of further interest is that when Hume did die, seven years later, in 1776,  he apparently died in a way  consistent with his claim to equanimity in the face of death.  Adam Smith's account of Hume's death is here , <a href=\"http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/smitha/humedead.htm\" title=\"http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/smitha/humedead.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/smitha/humedead.htm</a>  a letter  reproduced at <a href=\"http://www.civilisation.com\" title=\"www.civilisation.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.civilisation.com</a>. It is rather reminiscent of the account of Socrates' death in Plato's \"Phaedo.\" \r<br/><br/>For my part, I rather like the insouciance of another sage, Henry David Thoreau, on his deathbed.  Parker Pillsbury, an acquaintance, asked him: \"You seem so near the brink of the dark river that I almost wonder how the opposite shore may appear to you.\" Thoreau's answer was: \"One world at a time.\"\r", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 2842766, "replies": [], "lft": 40, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/philosophy-as-an-art-of-dying/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3984085, "rgt": 41, "userDisplayName": "Ladislav Nemec", "createDate": "1307927913", "userID": 4187964, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1307939276", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "big bear, ca", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1307935676", "commentSequence": 17, "commentBody": "Being probably closer to death than most readers here (at  77 and just about to undergo major triple surgery) I still have no idea why this biologically inevitable event deserves all the attention of 'philosophers' and other 'thinkers'.

The coward feels that the center of life is not in his leader or society but in himself. He is feared as well as despised, because unless his behavior is shouted down with contempt and ridicule there will be a slight suggestion about it of sanity in the midst of hysteria. . . . Falstaff is . . . the spokesman of the ironic vision that outlives the tragic one.\"<br/>\nNorthrup Frye, \"The Fools of Time\"", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 2841755, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/coming-tonight-the-2011-tony-awards/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3984401, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Mercedes", "createDate": "1307936398", "userID": 28125733, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1307939374", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1307935774", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "Actually, Sutton Foster thanked her dresser, Julian Havard, the FIRST time she won an Tony...", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2843324, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/about-that-tonys-rap/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3984407, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Freddie", "createDate": "1307936510", "userID": 8230676, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1307939377", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1307935777", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Trying to spoof Mr Miranda's great rap.

To a stone, the death of Sarfraz Shah would have meant nothing; philosophers, poets, artists, etc are trying to redeem humanity from the stone's vision.<br/><br/>Also, in general, there are poets who deserve to be mentioned with Socrates, More, etc. Seamus Heaney has written some very good essays on Mandelstam.

What are they thinking?   Why are no tax increases on the table? No one wants to raise taxes --the big 800-pound gorilla in the room.

We don't need \"shared sacrifice\" as President Obama keeps repeating.  What we really need is for those very same billionaires to \"sacrifice\" just a little bit and compensate the American taxpayer by paying a fair tax hike (how does 50% sound, Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GE  who paid zero tax last year?)

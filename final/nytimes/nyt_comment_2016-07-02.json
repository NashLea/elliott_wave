It's crazy to think that 250 million cars and trucks in the US will be magically be replaced by electric vehicles without enormous damage to the environment.

Still stuck in a \"paper or plastic?\" mindset.  We know how to arrange our built environment to minimize negative impacts on the natural environment:  compact, walkable towns and cities.

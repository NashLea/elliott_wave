But considering your inquisition of (and rather shallow conclusion regarding) Dr. Lewis, I wonder if you have a post in which you report on a similar exchange with Schneider.<br /><br />I also wonder if you have any comment on the failure of the powers that be at the APS to comply with the organization's constitutional requirement that on the strength of a petition by a minimum of 200 members they are obliged to (in this instance) convene a Topical Group to conduct an independent study and assessment.<br /><br />Which, of course, gives rise to the further question:<br /><br />In light of the APS assertion, in its recent Press Release, that \"relatively few APS members conduct climate change research\" and the glaringly obvious absence of any due diligence (i.e. the conduct of an independent study and assessment), why should the APS \"Statement\" - and its authoritative/authoritarian* proclamation - be given any weight whatsoever?<br /><br />* From the APS \"Statement\":<br /><br />\"The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth\u2019s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.\"<br /><br />IOW, why the focus on Dr. Lewis - without the context of the APS actions (and inactions)?<br /><br />And why the exclusion from the APS exhortation that \"reduce emisions of greenhouse gases now\" = \"we can only reduce emissions of GHGs by the draconian (and unproven) measure of (Armstrong's 10:10 revolutionary certified?!) reduction of activities that result in less Carbon Dioxide in order to (according IPCC honchos, luminaries and videos) \"save the world\".<br /><br />FWIW, I do have some criticism of Dr. Lewis in that, while I understand and fully appeciate his sentiments, I don't find his (or anyone's) depiction of the CO2 (primary cause)-&gt;AGW hypothesis as \"fraud\" or \"scam\" to be helpful.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I have seen sufficient evidence (not the least of which is Michael Mann's recent whine-fest at the Washington Post), that I cannot but concur with the inference one draws from Dr. Lewis's letter of resignation: \"climate science\" - as it has been practiced and touted over the last 20 years or so - is not \"science\" ... at least not in my pre-post-modernist understanding of the word.", "recommendationCount": 13}, {"assetID": 1961552, "replies": [], "lft": 216, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/a-physicists-climate-complaints/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2691592, "rgt": 217, "userDisplayName": "R.

Plass (writing in 1956 remember) estimates that a doubling of CO2 would cause the planet to warm 3.6\u00baC, that CO2 levels would rise 30% over the 20th Century and it would warm by about 1\u00baC over the same period. The relevant numbers from the IPCC AR4 are a climate sensitivity of 2 to 4.5\u00baC, a CO2 rise of 37% since the pre-industrial and a 1900-2000 trend of around 0.7\u00baC\"<br /><br />His interest in climate was co-incidental to his paying job, which was doing calculations for infrared-sensing heat-seeking missiles in the atmosphere as a function of height.<br /><br />For those who might be curious, a good introduction to radiation calculations in the atmosphere (the basis of the first climate modeling efforts) is here:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.aip.org/history/climate/Radmath.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.aip.org...</a><br /><br />\"A pioneer was the physicist Gilbert N. Plass, who had been doing lengthy calculations of infrared absorption in the atmosphere. He held an advantage over earlier workers, having not only the use of digital computers, but also better numbers, from spectroscopic measurements done by a group of experimenters he was collaborating with at the Johns Hopkins University. Military agencies supported their work for its near-term practical applications, but Plass happened to have read Callendar's papers, and was personally intrigued by the old puzzle of the ice ages and other climate changes.\"<br /><br />The basic approach to handling radiation in any planetary atmosphere is still used today:<br /><br />\"Plass pursued these details with a thorough set of one-dimensional computations, taking into account the structure of the absorption bands at all layers of the atmosphere. His final figures showed convincingly that adding or subtracting CO2 could seriously affect the radiation balance layer by layer through the atmosphere, altering the temperature by a degree or more down to ground level.\"<br /><br />What Plass neglected, and what Manabe &amp; Wetherald later included in the first realistic models was atmospheric convection - driven by the tendency for hot air to rise.  This was all done in the mid 1960s, while the JASON people (including the chairman, Harold Lewis) were busy with research on how to 'cordon off' South Vietnam from North Vietnam. . . . Where will they dig up their next 'expert witness,' one wonders?<br /><br />In any case, the radiation calculations of Plass as applied within the radiation convection models of Manabe et al. are still basically correct and unchallenged.  Since then, it's been a matter of refinement - including ocean-atmosphere interactions, aerosol effects, and other greenhouse gases like CH4 and N2O.<br /><br />Nowhere does Lewis say anything about what might be wrong with that approach, or with the predictions it generated - all he does his hurl insults over ClimateGate emails related to tree ring datasets (a paleoclimate issue of minor importance - tree rings track temp, water, nutrients, and a few other factors and are not the best (or only) proxy for climate).  That's nothing compared to the far greater fraud in the JASON / DSB-supported missile defense program - or the actual deliberate criminal negligence seen in the BP \"DeepWaterGate\" oil spill.<br /><br />In contrast, the results of the basic radiative-convective model approach were verified by applying them to other planets with very different conditions:<br /><br />\"Primitive one-dimensional  models were also valuable, or even crucial, for studies of conditions far from normal. Various groups used simple sets of equations to get a rough picture of the basic physics of the atmospheres of other planets such as Mars and Venus. When they got plausible rough results for the vastly different conditions of temperature, pressure, and even chemical composition, that confirmed that the basic equations were broadly valid.\"<br /><br />So, where precisely does Dr. Lewis find fault?  Attacking the UEA researchers over their poorly considered but non-fraudulent emails doesn't constitute finding any fault with radiation-convection models, does it?

In 1766, France agreed to leave the islands to Spain, with Spain reimbursing France for the cost of the settlement. Spain claimed the Islands under provisions in the Treaty of Tordesillas which settled the limits of the Spanish Empire in the Americas.  The Spanish took control of Port Saint Louis and renamed it Puerto Soledad in 1767 and regained control of the Islands. In fact, Spain and Great Britain came close to war over the issue, but instead, concluded a treaty on 22 January 1771, allowing the British to return to Port Egmont with neither side relinquishing sovereignty claims. The British returned in 1771 but for economic reasons decided to leave the islands in 1774 leaving Spain in full de facto control. As Argentina declared independence from Spain, the islands were ruled from Buenos Aires as part of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate till they were again invaded by Great Britain.

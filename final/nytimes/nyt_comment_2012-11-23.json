The other 40% may experience a little pain, but that pain is necessary for the common good, and could be made temporary, as the state income tax increase in CA through proposition 30.<br/><br/>It would be quite desirable to have another tax bracket of 50% on &gt;$5 million, and still another of 70% on &gt;$25 million. A \"blessing\" in disguise for the 70% taxpayers is that they would be far less tempted to operate at the edges of law, with less chance to end up in prison.<br/><br/>Tax expenditures should be reduced, without hurting the lower income groups: Capital gains tax should be raised to 25%; dividends &gt;$10,000 and hedge fund managers incomes should be treated as ordinary incomes, as so on. All these would add around $6 trillion to the revenue in ten years, enough to balance the budget by then, if not earlier, I believe, and will still have enough money for a second stimulus, most of which would pay for itself, eventually.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3339006, "replies": [], "lft": 29, "assetURL": "http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/cambodia-is-a-sunny-country-for-shady-characters/", "parentID": 7168456, "commentID": 7706325, "rgt": 30, "userDisplayName": "will w", "createDate": "1353509495", "userID": 4337288, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1353653713", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new fairfield, ct", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1353653713", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "the author's intent was not the article you wanted to read, so write your own then.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3347804, "replies": [], "lft": 16, "assetURL": "http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/the-new-japanese-worker-is-chinese/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7712105, "rgt": 17, "userDisplayName": "kei", "createDate": "1353574736", "userID": 66965393, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1353653730", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Japan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1353653730", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "Now I am living in Japan and I actually see lots of foreigners working in stores and restaurants.Most of them seem to be Chinese or Koreans.They really work hard and speak Japanese fluently.I don't know whether japanese people can work in other countries like them.We Japanese really need to overcome our shyness in various situations.

Furthermore, this idea that international justice can overnight develop into a system able to investigate and prosecute ALL the most powerful individuals in the world is unrealistic and not helping anyone.

It's a race to the bottom.  We would never overpay for a terrible product or go to an incompetent surgeon if there was transparency in medical care quality and medical billing.  Transparency would weed out incompetent, dishonest doctors with out-of-date skills and reduce medical costs via enabling consumers to comparison price shop for medical care. My surgeon was a medical fraud who instead of performing the consented to and long planned modern, minimally-invasive surgery, just did an old-fashioned, open procedure, butcher job for no medical or anatomical reason. She did it because she fraudulently misrepresented her skills and experience. My surgeon's hospital then billed thousands of dollars to my health insurance company for the unused laparoscopic surgery tools and materials that just sat in the OR in their wrapping while my doctor butchered me with her scalpel, breaching my consent. Medical fraud and malpractice have enormous unnecessary costs. When patients are injured, the irony is that they must then pay all the enormous medical bills to treat the iatrogenic injuries. The worse the quality of care, the more doctors, medical groups, and hospitals make.

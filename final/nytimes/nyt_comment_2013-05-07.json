Now some still believe that African-Americans are inherently unqualified to do certain kinds of jobs precisely because they are of black heritage. The law says you can think that if you like, but you can't act on it in hiring. The criteria that the opponents of gays in Scouting want to continue to use say that, inherently, homosexuals lack the qualifications to be a Scout leader (or until now, even a member) because of who they are and should systematically be denied involvement in Scouting. Firstly, that is ridiculous, since plenty of gays have been successful Scouts. They were qualified. Secondly, that is discrimination against a group based on the beliefs of certain religious leaders, but not all, giving preference to the religious beliefs of certain people involved in Scouting, as Mr. Bruni points out. That contradicts the supposed ideals of Scouting.

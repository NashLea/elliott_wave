The stuff is poison to most people.  Think carefully about \"wheat\" as a seed: it does not want to be eaten, it wants to be a new wheat plant.  Nature did not create wheat for us to eat. Wheat has evolved to produce chemicals in the wheat \"seed\" that both protect the seed from being eaten, and digested, and to further the growth of the seed into a plant.  None of this is intended by nature to be beneficial for seed eaters. The best one can hope for is to be able to tolerate those problematic chemical compounds n the short term.<br /><br />Consider as well that people have been eating wheat in significant amounts only for the last 6,000 to 10,000 years, compared to the prior diet, which did not include wheat much, if at all.  People did not evolve eating wheat, because it was simply not available.  Even cows, natural herbivores of course, get sick when eating grains.<br /><br />Yes, the wheat farmers will suffer, but there are other things to grow and eat.

To accept anything less than the bomb for Iran is to swallow its pride and accept a status of second best, which Iran will not do. Even with very harsh punishments from the international community, this will simply goad Iran to insist on getting the bomb even more. Its the psychology of pride: the more we try to punish Iran, the more Iran is determined to get the bomb, as a simple mark of pride. You can't humiliate Iran into dropping its nuclear program, you can only make Iran angrier and more insistent on getting it.<br /><br />The question then is: how do you stop Iran from getting the bomb? And the answer is: you don't. With Libya, it was more about the ego of one man: Qaddafi. Qaddafi could be bargained with, and then the matter was dropped. But even if you got rid of all the hardliners in Iran, even if Iran experienced some sort of revolution by the students on the street, even then, Iran will still insist on getting the bomb. Ask those students, who despise Ahmadinejad and his Republican Guards, if Iran should get the bomb, and say will say: \"of course, yes\". What the students do, they do in the name of loving Iran, just as much as their polar opposites, the basiji, also love Iran: they all think Iran deserves the bomb. Its simple national pride.<br /><br />We have to think about planning for a world with an Iranian bomb. Only because it is completely inevitable. But we can't make peace with that fact, because the idea of an Iranian bomb is frightening. You are talking about a country on the edge of popular revolution, and a power struggle going on between forces of a military dictatorship and grumpy old men who believe they interpret the will of God and are empowered by the country's constitution to rule by their interpretations.<br /><br />So between the theocrats, the military junta, and the angry students, now you get people in that mix with their fingers on a big red button... in a volatile region of the world.<br /><br />I honestly don't believe this can end well, I really don't. I try to be optimistic in life, but I am completely pessimistic about the implications of the coming reality of an Iranian bomb. It's genuinely frightening.<br />", "recommendationCount": 9}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

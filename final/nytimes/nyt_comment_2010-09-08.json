I believe most homeowners actually lose money over the life of owning a home.  Furthermore, I believe the losses are generally greater the larger the house.  The cost of energy to run a home is directly proportionate to the size of the home, too.  That being said, I still don't think the recent housing crisis and recession will ultimately turn recent home owners into renters in a big way.  Owning a home will always be very desirable.<br /><br />I am certain architects are capable of designing smaller 1500 to 1800 square foot homes that are highly functional, practical and feel much larger.   All levels of governments should be creating incentives for builders to build these smaller, efficient homes and buyers to purchase them.

There's a 12-month backlog of unsold homes; probably twice that many when you consider the ones being held off the market by banks and by homeowners who just plain can't sell as they watch their home drop in value. So, no, there will not be some magical rebound in housing or a resurgence of McMansions. The easy credit and criminal mortgage schemes that inflated the bubble are gone for good.

The kind of dad who knew their friends' names; drove them to practices, rehearsals, and games; read to them; played board games with them; and willingly spent scarce leisure time with them. A child-centric dad, in other words.<br /><br />I didn't have that kind of father. When I was a young woman listening to another young woman talking about how her dad loved to take them to the movies or canoeing or to track meets, I would be amazed. My father never made time just for us; if we wanted to hang out with him we did what he wanted to do. I spent a lot of time at the golf driving range and waiting in the car while he went into \"the factory\" on a Saturday to check how the weekend shift was going.<br /><br />I didn't mind any of that, but neither did I have any expectations that he would make any effort to meet me halfway in my world.<br /><br />So I'm really pretty sure that most women do not make the calculation that their daughter doesn't need a father.

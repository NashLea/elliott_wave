There are so many positives and negatives to this sort of action.<br />The positive being that children that have been abducted by the non-custodial parent (many times done as a way to punish the other parent and not because they have a desire to truly be with their children) will be returned home where they belong.<br />The negative, which is why I suggest to those fleeding domestic violence situations, where the families lives are in danger of being ended, (murdered) and the parent who is taking them is the custodial parent, is that those fleeing, work for themselves. And that if they file a tax return and are recieving a return back, that they have it direct deposited into a bank account that is in a different state than they are. Instead of making many little withdrawls by their debit card, they immediately remove all cash, and put it into a different account.<br />If legislation was to pass for these kinds of laws, it has so many compounded issues which would go hand in hand.<br />It would mean that the Government must be ready to step it up when it comes to protecting those that are abused and have had to flee. Making the laws tougher on the abuser who caused for fleeing. Because while it will help protect children that were abducted by the non-custodial parent, it can put a death warrant out on those who have had to flee to save their childrens and their own lives.<br />If you, or anyone that you know or love is in an abusive relationship, please visit the safty pages at <a href=\"http://www.lindaslaw.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lindaslaw.org/index.html</a>  And if you know a child who is the victim of domestic violence who could use some positive hopes for the future, please have them enter the \"Art for Hope\" scholarship that I have set up.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.lindaslaw.org/id16.html?ref=nf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lindaslaw.org/id16.html?ref=nf</a><br /><br />Art for hope. A unique scholarship for the children of Domestic Violence. Because lets face it, they are the most innocent of our victims and they need healing too.<br /><br />Without healing, without a way to be recognized for their place in Domestic Violence, they can become lost, with a greater chance of repeating the cycle of domestic violence. And truly, the only real way to stop domestic violence is to stop it before it happens.

This corresponds to 600 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere.  We can expect that CO2 content in ca. 2130 a.d. <br/><br/>Recall that Harrison's original post concerned the next 100 years. I agree that that is a reasonable policy-relevant horizon. <br/><br/>So Ries's data show that, in the next 100 years, the following sea creatures will INCREASE their calcification rates: <br/><br/>Blue crabs, shrimp, lobster, limpets, purple urchins, coralline red algae, and halimeda. <br/><br/>No change is expected for blue mussels, temperate coral, pencil urchins, hard clams, conch, and serpulid worms.<br/><br/>In the next 100 years, the calcification rates of periwinkles, bay scallops, oysters, whelks and soft clams  may decline but still within the error bands of the present (400 ppm CO2) environment. <br/><br/>How, I ask you, can any responsible scientist maintain that this is a catastrophe any time in the next 100 years?<br/><br/>Re coccoliths, see Halloran, P.R., et al, Biogeosciences 5:1651-1655, 2008. I quote \"in the real ocean the larger coccolithophore species increase their calcification in response to anthropogenic CO2 release\"<br/><br/>Re coral reefs, see Takahasi, A, Coral Reefs 32: 305-314 2013 \"no evidence of CO2 impact on bleaching\"<br/><br/>Is this a catastrophe?

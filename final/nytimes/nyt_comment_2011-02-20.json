The vast majority of academic learning takes place alone at night with a book and all the high priced facilities are just noise.  WHy do a need a library with a million books if many students barely master the 3 or 4 text books they are assigned each semester.  Some suggestions for instituions supported by taxpayers:<br />1. Mandatory attendance at lectures  (with reasonable exceptions).<br />2. Start every class with simple pass/fail computer graded multiple choice exam to determine if the student at least struggled to understand the material prior to the lecture (from the high priced profesor).<br />3.  Students that don;t show up and put in real effort no longer get a taxpayer funded education.<br />If these policies wer implemented \"productivity\" would rise dramatically.  Video lectures will never be as good as live but they are much beter than a live lecture that isn't attended or for which the student is not prepared.<br />Another option is first year of college at a local high school.  The classrooms are now  empty at night so facilities virtually free.  Many good HS or local college professors (who get their health benefits and pensions from their primary institition) will moolight to teach first year calculus, bio chem etc.  so teaching costs cheap.  Students work and study during the day.  You don;t need Princeton to get someone through calc 101.  Of course it would not be nearly as good an overall experience as Princeton but you might deliver the first year for $5K instead of $50K. The bright student who works hard will still win out. America needs to stop thinking about creating the perfect college experience at someone else's expenses and try to create a good enough experience at low expense irrespective of who pays for it. Also the first course for any student taking on student loans (and perhaps even those who aren't) should be personal finance so they understand what they are getting into. It's a crime what's being done to the kids who have no idea what they are getting into and are burdened for decades with debt they can never pay off used in many cases for classes of little value.<br /><br />The emphasis has to be on reducing the underlying cost ", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2428781, "replies": [], "lft": 90, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/message-2/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3412255, "rgt": 91, "userDisplayName": "Martin", "createDate": "1298177670", "userID": 239837, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1298179620", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1298179620", "commentSequence": 40, "commentBody": "ali,<br /><br />The short story was, indeed, originally published in the  Harvard Advocate:<br /><a href=\"http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1658-downriver-and-heavenward-with-james-agee\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.criterion.com...</a><br /><br />It appeared in this volume more recently:<br /><a href=\"http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=230\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.loa.org...</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2430928, "replies": [], "lft": 36, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/gift/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3412278, "rgt": 37, "userDisplayName": "John", "createDate": "1298177968", "userID": 12857582, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1298179631", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1298179631", "commentSequence": 17, "commentBody": "Eleven bars and I\u2019m still thirsty.

Technology indeed has a depersonalizing effect, and that effect carries over to our increasingly infrequent physical interactions with one another. Internet rage is like road rage. Otherwise decent people become raving maniacs in their anonymous cars and behind their anonymous computer screens. Impulse control in adults is becoming rare, because bad behavior is increasingly being accepted as the new normal. Torturers write bestsellers and never get punished, banksters are subsidized by the poor and get obscene bonuses. So that it's also open season on women in general, and Lara Logan in particular, should come as no surprise.<br /><br />Look at Congress as an example of the bad behavior of powerful people. These elected officials - mostly men and mostly Republicans - are misogynists of the lowest order in their outrageous assault upon all women. They have systematically gone after every program that benefits women: the WIC maternal nutrition program and Planned Parenthood, to name just two. Some legislators have even gone so far as to recommend referring to rape victims as \"accusers\" rather than victims: a first in the annals of criminology. And thus Lara Logan, like many a rape victim before her, is being victimized twice.<br /><br />I wish her a speedy recovery, physically and mentally, and hope that all the callous people will soon crawl back into their anonymous little cyber-sewers where they can be neither seen nor heard.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com</a>/ ", "recommendationCount": 1094}, {"assetID": 2431097, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/opinion/20dowd.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3411706, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Larry Eisenberg", "createDate": "1298165898", "userID": 56166904, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1298187627", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1298187627", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "What pleasure those nasty Tweets yield!<br />Bytes tumble like seeds in a Field,<br />No empathy grows,<br />Just more verbal blows,<br />Themes like \"Love thy Neighbor\"?

I don't think all of these callous, sadistic comments are the fault of technology, however.

People imitate the high-paid examples in front of them. Where technology comes in is that anyone can spew viciousness anonymously over the internet. I can see the value of posting anonymously in a police state, e.g. Mubarak's Egypt or present-day China or Bahrain.

These \"guys\" really know how to each others backs.<br/><br/>Sterling and Balmer are probably toasting each other and laughing at us all from up in their penthouses.  And were the rest of the NBA owners in on the planning of this as well?<br/><br/>Silver's announcement that the league meant to \"punish\" Sterling for his racism and offensive comments?  That's even a bigger laugh!

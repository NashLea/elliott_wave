The long term committed climate change is bigger than the transient warming you see over fifty years by a factor that is probably 1.5 to 2, but is almost impossible to project in advance from monitoring the climate (a point I made in my AGU Early Warning Systems talk last fall).  So, by the time you see something catastrophic coming round the bend, you are already committed to a lot more warming to come, so (short of equally dangerous monkeying with Earth's albedo) what do you do at that point?  Even dropping CO2 instantaneously to zero by instantaneously replacing all fossil fuel plants by nuclear won't undo the damage, because the CO2 in the atmosphere will continue to have an almost unabated impact on climate for the following thousand years.  The only \"contingent mitigation\" strategy that could conceivably make sense would be having a backup plan to scrub CO2 out of the atmosphere, and certainly more research on that is needed.  However, it is so difficult to do this economically that it's highly uncertain whether any workable air capture scheme will come along in time, and be deployable at scale fast enough, to do anything like \"contingent mitigation.\"  I don't see any value in that concept.

When a reporter asked him the other day about his job-killing budget plan, Boehner said, \"If some of those jobs are lost, so be it.\" Tough luck. Amen. Dana Milbank of the Washington Post writes that about 650,000 government jobs would be lost under the House budget plan &amp; 325,000 indirect support jobs would go, too.\" I call the House plan the The Million-Man Unemployment Budget.<br /><br />Of course, Boehner isn't as callous as he sounds. He did back a proposal to build F-15 engines in his home state of Ohio, even tho Defense Secretary Robert Gates had said repeatedly the engines were superfluous. Bad news for Boehner: the House voted down the F-15 engines. Boehner sure doesn't have much control over his caucus. So be it. Tough luck. Amen.<br /><br />And Boehner tried to pretend those government &amp; collateral jobs his budget would eliminate were the 200,000 jobs President Obama had added to the federal work force. The truth, according to several sources, including PolitiFact, is closer to 20,000 jobs added, and most of those are in security &amp; military personnel -- areas that Republicans won't touch. Mike Hall of the AFL-CIO writes that \"on a per capita basis (federal employees per 1,000 Americans), [the federal payroll is now] at the lowest level at least since 1962.\"<br /><br />The \"intellectual\" Paul Ryan is not above making stuff up, either. He said this week of President Obama's budget proposal: \"What we have is $1.6 trillion in new tax increases, $8.7 trillion in new spending. He's going to be adding $13 trillion to the debt over the course of his budget.\" But fact-checker Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post says of Ryan's fuzzy math, \"It's bad enough to toss around 10-year figures. And Obama could be faulted for not submitting a budget that gets federal government spending back to the 20.3 percent of the gross domestic product. But to demand that he meet a standard no modern president has ever met -- and then label it as 'new spending' -- is highly misleading.\"<br /><br />The House isn't the only place where Republican play fast and loose with the numbers. I'd give the crown to Sen. Jeff Sessions. He complained on the teevee that President Obama's budget wasn't serious because it would only reduce the deficit by $1.3 trillion over the next ten years. Then he went on another show and said the House budget was great because it reduced the federal deficit by $1 trillion over the next ten years. That is, a Republican budget that reduces the deficit significantly less, and primarily on the backs of the poor and middle-class, is WAY better than a Democratic budget that -- for the most part -- finds savings elsewhere.<br /><br />No, I'm not giving President Obama a pass on cutting home-heating subsidies &amp; Pell grants. And I'm perfectly aware that Obama's game is to let Republicans hang themselves, then \"compromise\" with other cuts that will hurt poor- and middle-class families. As Jon Stewart says, all of the proposed cuts by both the House &amp; the President are to programs that Democratic voters like.<br /><br />But still.

Republicans frame the debate and control the narrative. Day after day they blame and pound the Democrats in the media for not cutting enough from the 12% piece of the pie while instilling fear about run away deficits and getting the uninformed populace worked up in a feeding frenzy like they always do. Why don\u2019t the Democrats remind the people that it was the Republicans that created these massive deficits through 2 wars, 3 tax cuts and Medicare Part D. The facts haven\u2019t changed in 10 years and never will? When you constantly roll over, the other side will eat your lunch or in this case steal your programs.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Republicans offer No specific cuts, just wishy-washy generalizations of why domestic programs should be cut without touching Defense. Why should they? They control the media and the rhetoric. The end result is always the same: the Democrats will unilaterally cut more domestic programs without calling out the Republicans\u2019 phony bluff. It\u2019s like the Republicans say to the Democrats, Is that all you can cut? We can and we will cut more. So what do the Democrats do, they cut more even though the Republicans never had a plan to cut anything. This way the Republicans can blame the Democrats at election time for the actual cuts and the Republicans can walk away scotch free like they did in the run up to Iraq. Nothing ever sticks. Of course, the media portrays the Democrats as the villains because they actually did something to solve the problem. This is what happens when you have a party that doesn\u2019t stand together on anything and fight for principal. Who knows what their principals are? Most people would respect them and maybe vote for them if they just stood their ground and fought back.<br /><br />The reality is that no one in Washington from either side (mostly from the Right) wants to make the tough decisions. Most of them are millionaires who will have a nice Government pension with full health benefits after they retire. Doing the people\u2019s business doesn\u2019t fit into their never ending quest to grab that golden corporate/lobbyist gig after they build up their resumes and develop some nice connections. Unfortunately, there is no one, including the media and populace who hold them accountable for their actions or lack of actions thereof. So yes, Defense will take precedence over everything else in the budget and domestic programs will be pared to the bone because very few in Washington are willing to stand up for the middle/working class. I think Willie would agree that corporate money always trumps people\u2019s needs.<br />", "recommendationCount": 421}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

At least, mixed signals of weakness and doubt over to our sworn enemies and their supporters by sending over billions of US taxpayer dollars, uninterrupted and guaranteed aid to a backstabbing and an untrustworthy ally Pakistan, who kills and maims US troops and attacks American foreign policy ever chance they get, while our leadership plays \"diplomacy\" instead of cracking down on terrorists and their supporters in the AfPak theatre.<br/>\nIts a national shame to see our troops being maimed and killed by a US taxpayer paid killer/attacker \"ally\" Pakistan, while our leadership plays politics!

According to SABR's Baseball Biography Project, \"A switch-hitter who was adept at getting on base, Wally Schang was considered by many of his contemporaries to be the best catcher of his time. Behind the plate, the 5\u201910\u201d, 180-pounder was one of the most athletic catchers of his day, so agile and alert that he occasionally played third base or in the outfield...\"<br/><br/>A fair objection to putting Schang on the list of greatest Yankee catchers might be that he only played for them for 5 years -- but they were the years the Yanks started winning (their first 3 pennants and first WS win).  That's why his WAR total looks low -- you're comparing him to career Yankees.  For his career Schang's total WAR is 43.8, statistically the same as Posada and Munson.  Since obviously I never saw him play, I rate Schang ahead based on the impression formed by my reading, including the James's HOF advocacy, which I don't think applies to Posada.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I rate Howard ahead of Posada based in part, perhaps, on the bias of childhood nostalgia for the Yankees of the '50s and '60s, then factoring in the burden of his pioneer status as the first black man on the Yankees, and finally considering his rather monumental achievements -- stardom, really -- in the early 60s.  I don't think WAR tells the whole story, though perhaps it does for Aaron Robinson, I don't know.  <br/><br/>I love Posada.  I saw him play his first professional season for the Oneonta Yankees when he was 19 and they were just starting to convert him to catcher.

One is the fundamental (and flawed) assumption that good teaching is the only thing needed to produce good education. Teachers, even great ones, can only do so much with the  time and resources they have access to. It's not uncommon for a kid to spend more time in front of the TV (or other screen) than in the classroom. <br/><br/>The other, which is not addressed by the programs described in this article, is the punitive nature of the attempts to fix things. Students not up to snuff in standardized exams?  Threaten the teachers and schools with loss of resources and potential firing. That'll learn them!  Parents not supervising homework, feeding their kids nutritious meals and volunteering at the school?  Berate them, fine them, and threaten to jail them.  That's make them parent better!<br/><br/>Both approaches ignore the fundamental issue that the best way to predict students' performance in multiple areas is to look at where they live, and the income and education levels of their parents.  You're not going to solve that by using punitive measures to get teachers to teach harder, and parents to parent harder. <br/><br/>I was talking to a colleague who had lived in the US (Los Angeles area) when his kids were small. I asked him about the education system, and he said it was actually fairly easy to get your kids a good education in the US. The secret was to buy a cheap house in an expensive neighbourhood.

It stands to reason that GENERALLY parents with higher incomes have more time to commit to volunteering at schools (SAHMs contributing the most time) and obsessing over their children's homework, leading to better performance. And conversely, school districts with less resources are USUALLY attended by children whose parents must work longer hours, sometimes multiple shifts, or perhaps just can't afford childcare for younger siblings while they attend school functions. It certainly doesn't mean these parents don't care about their children's education, and I'm sure many attend PTA meetings when they are able.

Due to the oceans, the planet's atmosphere is fairly moist in many places - and that also helps keep the surface warm, as anyone who has spent time in both deserts and coast regions can attest.  At night, in a desert, the temperature plummets as energy escapes to space by radiation - but along coasts at night, the water vapor absorbs that energy, just as a blanket would - leading to warm air at night.<br /><br />So, if you increase the level of atmospheric CO2, it begins to act the same way, but the effect is strongest at 10 km up - and this is clearly warming the planet at an appreciable rate, a process that will continue until about 50 years after fossil fuel combustion is eliminated globally, after which things will hopefully level off.<br /><br />The effects are perhaps not immediately catastrophic, but you might want to check with the victims of Pakistani floods and Russian heat waves before making that assessment - and it will certainly make life more difficult and uncomfortable for literally billions of people, at the very least.<br /><br />The truth is, if we had spent as much on renewable energy development in the past 40 years as we've spent on fossil fuel projects, we'd already have eliminated the use of the dirtier and more expensive fossil fuels (such as coal, tar sands, etc.) entirely, and be well on the way to phasing out natural gas and petroleum.  CO2 levels might be a good 20 ppm lower than they are today<br />(we were at 340 ppm in 1980).<br /><br />Interesting, isn't it, that the failure to take these steps may very well turn out to be one of the biggest blunders in human history?", "recommendationCount": 11}, {"assetID": 1961552, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 2690475, "replies": [], "commentID": 2691512, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Andy Revkin", "createDate": "1287202151", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1287202151", "userTitle": "Dot Earth blogger", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Hal", "userURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com", "userLocation": "", "depth": 1, "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1287198551", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "It's called due diligence, combined with the miracle of Google search.

It breaks the fundamental contract between the individual and society.<br />The Republican party embodies many of the more repugnant aspects of the society in my view. There vision hardly extends beyond protecting the wealth of the affluent and projecting military power to gain control of assets abroad.

Americans have gotten way too used to buying cheap goods from other countries where workers are pay 10-20% of U.S. wages. So has the rest of the world for that matter. The U.S. needs to be the innovator, and the American People need to demand that companies like Apple, Dell (and many mant others) build there devices here in the United States. Companies that are \"American\" or have substantial operations here should be required to hire Americans to build there products. Will the products the then cost more? Of course, but I have a feeling the iphone would sell just as many. With the trade imbalance that we have and the amount of borrowing we are doing we are just selling our collective soul.<br /><br />It doesn't have to be that way. When trade agreements are just destroying out way of life we have the right to say we cannot sustain this anymore, \"we are out\".  Other countries have significant barriers to trade, yet we are expected to only take the \"high road\".<br /><br />And while I am on the subject of unemployment we cannot forget about the illegals in this country.  They came here to make a better life for themselves. They cut our grass, work as domestics and do jobs Americans do not want, or at least did not want. There has been much talk about what to do with them.  Good people can disagree on this issue. However, before we can do anything we need to seal the border. If that means we have to build a 50 foot high wall, we should do it.  After we stop the illegal flow then we can have a national debate on what to do about them.

The last bubble was caused by loose lending standards. That was precipitated by the finance industry's use of cdo's to disconnect the risk created by bad loans from the makers of those loans. In fact, bad loans had a substantial market value.<br/><br/>Part of that problem could be laid on the low interest paid on AAA US Treasuries. Bond and mutual funds, whose prospectus promised AAA quality bonds, needed something that would create better returns. AAA rated bonds backed by real estate provided that product. <br/><br/>In short, the last bubble was a creative invention of smart people in the finance industry who profited enormously from it. <br/><br/>There has always been a disconnect between the housing market and the rental market.

A music student in a Faulkner class of mine had asked if he could work-up an opera for Absalom for his term paper, and I agreed.  He felt it was very tough going, but through his exercise, I saw that the kernel story of Absalom -- the half-brothers who discover during the War  Between the States that one of them has black blood -- is a magnificent tale and as operatic as a story can be.<br/>        This novel is regarded as Faulkner's greatest work.  I drafted a libretto of my own, learning from the trials of my student, just because I wanted to imagine how this tale would look and sound on stage.

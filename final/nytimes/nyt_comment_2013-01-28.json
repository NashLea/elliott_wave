The latest round of proposals to subject presidential elections to congressional-district gerrymandering is one example of how dangerous they are.  And the gerrymandered House and right-wing Supreme Court still have the all the monkey wrenches they need to stop the government from functioning, even though they've now lost the debt limit tool, which Obama never should have let them have in the first place.<br/><br/>Sorry, but there's a long way to go before we achieve progressive nirvana -- I'm not sure the recent election can even be considered the step before the step before the beginning of the end of plutocratic rule of America.

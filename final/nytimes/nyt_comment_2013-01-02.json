I tend to interpret the reviews that I read based on the price and apparent level of the establishment.  If I'm looking for a 3 star hotel, I don't expect the same level of services and amenities that I'd expect at a 5 star hotel and I try to be clear about those distinctions in my reviews.  I've stayed at and eaten at some of the top places in the world, but I typically eat and stay at much more modest establishments.  I rate them according to the their level of excellence within their relative level/cost and I make sure to comment on value, location and other facets.<br/><br/>I also check the Trip Adviser suggestions with other guidebooks and web sites before making final plans.  Overall, we have been extremely pleased with the places that we've chosen using Trip Adviser.<br/><br/>I should also note that there have been a few times (about 3% of my reviews) in which our experience has been quite negative.

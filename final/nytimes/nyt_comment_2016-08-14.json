Universities look for patterns of service and leadership. They look for inventiveness and a point of view.

To the degree possible, let them travel. Keep in mind these things don't have to cost a lot; traveling from Brooklyn to Manhattan can be an inexpensive eye opener and you'd be surprised how many kids have never done it!<br/><br/>Even if they don't get into Harvard, the lessons they'll learn will serve them well for the rest of their lives.

Free Trade and illegal immigration have made it harder for them to find steady, decent paying work.  Working women do not marry the father(s) of their children because the fathers earn so little money that they are seen as just \u201canother mouth to feed\u201d.  Today 40% of babies are being born to parents who are not married.  Even if the unmarried parents are living together when their baby is born, they usually split up by the time the child enters kindergarten.  We have more and more children growing up without their fathers.  Yet, Hillary Clinton and her supporters seem unaware of what ordinary Americans are going through.<br/><br/>Free Trade pacts let companies move many well-paying working class jobs out of the country.  And illegal immigrants have both taken many of the remaining jobs and kept wages low.  Yet, if an unemployed person complains about illegal immigrants, he is labeled a racist and ignored.  <br/><br/>Why do we care more about economic migrants than for our own people?", "recommendationCount": 14}, {"assetID": 3457197, "replies": [], "lft": 538, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-perfect-gop-nominee.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 19482015, "rgt": 539, "userDisplayName": "Schrodinger", "createDate": "1471149085", "userID": 8276026, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1471149129", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Northern California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1471145529", "commentSequence": 19482015, "commentBody": "This annoys me...\"like enabling George W.

Hillary got it wrong, but so did the New York Times editorial board. <br/><br/>What about Ms Dowd herself? Of the four columns she wrote before the vote on October 11th, 2002, only two mentioned the war vote, and one of those was mostly about Hillary. Dowd said of Hillary that, \"Whatever doubts she may have privately about the war, she is not articulating her angst as loudly as some of her Democratic colleagues. She knows that any woman who hopes to be elected president cannot have love beads in her jewelry case.\"<br/><br/>In her column 'Culture war with B-2's', Dowd comes out as mildly anti-war. \"Don't feel bad if you have the uneasy feeling that you're being steamrolled\", Dowd writes, \"You are not alone.\" Fourteen years later that column still looks good, and I link to it at the bottom. However, Dowd could and should have done a lot more. I don't think that anybody who draws a paycheck from the New York Times has a right to get on their high horse and lecture Hillary about her vote. They ignored the antiwar protests just like they ignored Bernie Sanders' large crowds. <br/><br/>The Bush Administration hinted that the anti-war people were traitors and terrorist sympathizers and everybody got steamrolled. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/culture-war-with-b-2-s.html\" title=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/culture-war-with-b-2-s.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/culture-war-with-b-2-s.html</a> ", "recommendationCount": 158}, {"assetID": 3457202, "replies": [], "lft": 1993, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-gop.html", "parentID": 19480509, "commentID": 19481056, "rgt": 1994, "userDisplayName": "Joe", "createDate": "1471141644", "userID": 66421514, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1471149222", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Danville, CA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1471145622", "commentSequence": 19481056, "commentBody": "The good news is that this is a shrinking minority.

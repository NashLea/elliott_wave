In this sense the current trend to limit the definition of genetic modification to mean interspecies exchanges of genetic material is too limited. Most of the more common negative claims about the risks of GMOs have little or no evidence to support them, whereas the risks of inbreeding and crop monocultures have been known for centuries.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting we ignore the risks of GMOs, but to sharon's point about scientific literacy I am suggesting that we take a more comprehensive look at how we have modified our food sources in ways that put us a big risks.

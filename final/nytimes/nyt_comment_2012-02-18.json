Yet all of the activities you cited are only done in order to profit. Profit is nothing less that taking more than you need from a closed system. By taking in more money than you circulate through the system, you crate a deficiency elsewhere in the system. It is no secret that a few people sit on vast fortunes. And those vast fortunes could carry the futures of millions of families to a better condition. But that wealth is kept out of the general system. And so, others are forced to do without. This is what is happening now. And as we can see, it represents a far greater drain on the economy than the total number of welfare recipients combined. TARP swallowed up over 8 trillion dollars. What does an average family cost per year? 50k?<br/><br/>The system is not the problem. The problem is the incorrect application of our interpersonal relationships. If we related to each other correctly, then we would correct the functioning of our social and economic systems to reflect this correction in perception. As it stands we created these systems because we need to cooperate in order to survive. But we corrupt these systems because we relate to each other from hatred. We must learn to correct our relationships by learning to live outside our own personal interests. This is Human work. And without it we won't solve anything. <a href=\"http://www.perceivingreality.com\" title=\"http://www.perceivingreality.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.perceivingreality.com</a><br/><br/>Peace to you and yours.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3306892, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/how-lin-makes-his-teammates-better/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5549798, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "jjllss33", "createDate": "1329533691", "userID": 29023742, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1329541269", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "nj", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1329541269", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Full many a gem of purest trey serene<br/>\nThe dark unfathomed gyms of Harvard bear.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3306872, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/mullin-reflects-on-trade-for-anthony/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5549963, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Mark Kreloff", "createDate": "1329537077", "userID": 63954003, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1329541276", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1329541276", "commentSequence": 2, "commentBody": "Remarkable grasp of the obvious.

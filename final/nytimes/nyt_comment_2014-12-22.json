But I think this is a simplistic interpretation; and perhaps even a cynical one, for it seems to conclude that Santa Claus is basically wishful thinking.<br/><br/>The second, and I think subtler interpretation, is hinted at when Mr. Church says that Santa Claus \"exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist . . .\"  Santa Claus does not exist merely because we wish him to, but because we make him exist.  Mr. Church did not say whether Santa Claus was flesh and blood.  I think that he found that question both unanswerable and irrelevant.

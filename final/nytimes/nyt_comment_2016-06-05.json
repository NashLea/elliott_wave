Each time Obama has tried to compromise they refuse to negotiate in good faith, acting more like kindergartners who've not yet learned to share. <br/><br/>I have no idea what country or state of illusion you have been living in for the last 8 years, but it is decidedly NOT the same one I've been living in. After years of financial starvation under Bush, the VA was a mess. It IS getting better. I know this to be a fact! And it would be a whole lot further along in it's re-haul if  Congress would appropriated the funds needed to do this!!!! But the Republican held congress refuses. They refused to obey the Constitution in doing their JOB to hold confirmation hearings to fill the supreme court vacancy!! As for the economy, Bush trashed it. Obama had to clean it up. He's done a fine job of that. Can you do better? Would it just be more trickle down economics which we ALL know doesn't work? Trump is unfit in every way to be president"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 18741052, "replies": [], "commentID": 18744274, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "EHooey", "createDate": "1465141561", "userID": 10048422, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1465154936", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 3, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Bruce Rozenblit", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Toronto", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1465151336", "commentSequence": 18744274, "commentBody": "John Brown:\"Anyone wanting to see stupidity, hate, race baiting, divisiveness, ignorance, lawlessness, and gross incompetence need look no further than Obama and Hillary. After 8 years of Obama the Obama V.A. is still killing our veterans, and lines to get through airport security are far worse than they have ever been and getting worse, not to mention that Obama has given us the worst economic growth under any President since the Great Depression.\"  You are talking about the wrong period - that was the presidency of George Bush when the economy tanked - do you remember at the end of his presidency when the job market was shrinking by 800,000 jobs?????  President Obama has made heroic efforts, they had to be heroic because of the opposition he faced from the GOP who did not want Americans to recover so that he would not be re-elected.  How did that work out for you?  And you can blame those long lines at TSA on the GOP who hold the purse strings and have cut funding to allow increased staff to service the increased traffic at airports with the improved economy.  So, sure vote for Trump who will just blow up the whole world when he gets ticked off with Putin!!

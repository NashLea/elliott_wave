It's not a clerical job but requires a fair amount of experience and education.  The Social Security rules are complex and, in some cases, byzantine, so it takes awhile to get the hang of it.  I wish it were as simple as using facts, good judgment and common sense when deciding on claims but sadly, it sometimes isn't.  A great deal of weight in allowing or denying claims can come from the Medical Consultants (MCs) and, particularly, from both the Consulting Examiner (the psychiatrist or psychologist who does a consultative exam on the claimant) as well as the MCs (these are docs who work directly for Social Security, reviewing the claim, including medical records).  In addition, decisions can be reversed at appeals level by a judge.  Thus, the system itself can produce results that an individual has a difficult time mitigating -- especially when inaccurate medical advice is given. The system sort of has a life of its own. In some cases, a whole claim can hinge on a report from one psychiatrist. Medical records do play a part, but with lack of evidence the consultative exam can play a large role (thus, the emphasis put on coaching these NYPD schemers to fool the psychiatrists). The \"clerks\" who you refer to -- actual adjudicators who oversee the medical portion of claim from beginning to end -- have their hands tied when an MC overrules their analysis of the claim.

When the government cuts off benefits to one person in an apartment, they affect everyone living with the person--family or not. As a full-time worker, it still put me into debt that took me a year and a half to dig out of, because I was only just barely making ends meet myself, and she obviously couldn't pay her utilities either (which I also covered so I didn't destroy my credit rating--you can't put 3 people on a utility bill, even if 3 unrelated people live in that apartment.) <br/><br/>The ripple effect is harsh, because when you cut someone off from benefits, and they can't get a job, the people around them in their same economic class suffer too--friends, family, roommates. <br/><br/>It wasn't her fault, but her bad financial situation almost took me down too.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3391402, "replies": [], "lft": 1085, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/us/politics/unemployment-benefits.html", "parentID": 10903999, "commentID": 10904403, "rgt": 1086, "userDisplayName": "Kathy in CT", "createDate": "1389157363", "userID": 46565261, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1389157423", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Fairfield County CT", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1389157423", "commentSequence": 10904403, "commentBody": "How to pay for it?

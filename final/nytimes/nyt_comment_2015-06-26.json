This should be stated over and over. <br/><br/>The Affordable Care Act/Obamacare is not a left-wing, liberal, progressive approach to comprehensive health care and insurance. That would be something akin to a single payer system like the National Health Service, or Canada's or France's or Japan's systems, all of which cost FAR LESS per person than US health has and still does. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, Obamacare is still 1,000 times better than the nightmare we had before it was enacted.

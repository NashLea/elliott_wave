As President Obama has repeatedly made clear, the GOP can address the immigration issue by the House taking a vote on an immigration reform bill that has broad majority support in both houses of Congress and among the American people. Immigration reform has already passed the Senate 68-32, with 14 Republic votes. And it could easily pass the House if Boehner would let it come up for a vote. Instead, Boehner refuses and conservatives are having one of their overwrought freak outs over President Obama taking executive action on immigration just as Presidents Reagan and Bush did. <br/><br/>The problem, of course, is that the base of the GOP is so angered by the increasing Latino population in our country that they are virulently opposed to anything short of getting undocumented immigrants to \"self-deport.\" That base is holding the GOP hostage and the GOP, in turn, is threatening to hold our economy and government hostage.

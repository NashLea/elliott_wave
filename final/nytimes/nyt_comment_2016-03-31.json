I was fortunate to hear them when they testified before the US Senate Environment &amp; Public Works Committee, Chaired by Senator Moynihan of NY who rediscovered them &amp; Maglev in 1987 and he requested that they appear and testify.  They did &amp; were asked to lead a study committee of Maglev &amp; transportation experts,  The report made a convincing case that a Maglev transport network capable of carrying both trucks &amp; passengers at an average speed of 300 mph and also capable of electronic switching and operating on conventional railroads on Maglev adapted railroad tracks should be our next surface transport system to add capacity to our aging, costly and congested Interstate Highway System.  This became a bi-partisan RDTE proposal to the Senate and it passed but it failed to get out of Committee in the House because of strong opposition of existing transport interests.

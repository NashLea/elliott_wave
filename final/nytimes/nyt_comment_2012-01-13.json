To me, the scariest part of this data is that some of these head injuries are not severe enough to cause a concussion.  The very act of repetitively hitting one's head (even at sub-concussive levels) may have lasting health consequences!<br/><br/>While the risk of head injury is not limited to football (see men's ice hockey), the fact remains that head impacts are integral to tackle football as we now know it.  The average high school lineman has ~700 head impacts during a season - this cannot be healthy.<br/><br/>Until there is more data available (and the experts who are studying CTE expect to have some significant guidelines in the coming years), I think it is inadvisable to allow young children to play tackle football.  <br/><br/>The human brain is not fully developed until we are in our 20's. Until we know that a younger brain is not more vulnerable than a mature brain, it is our duty as parents to protect our children.  Once children are in high school, they have a better ability to understand risk and should have more of a voice in this decision.  <br/><br/>While I agree with the concept that we cannot raise kids in bubbles and that life is full of risks, some risks are not worth the benefit.  <br/><br/>My vote is for no tackle football prior to high school.", "recommendationCount": 15}, {"assetID": 3300050, "replies": [], "lft": 408, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/business/media/mad-for-downton-publishers-have-a-reading-list.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5256353, "rgt": 409, "userDisplayName": "CIndy Watter", "createDate": "1326431402", "userID": 20013362, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1326431477", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1326431477", "commentSequence": 127, "commentBody": "I am thrilled to see so many people recommending Testament of Youth, which is the first part of a trilogy, by the way.

I'm an attorney with mega-debt like this woman will have and I've regretted going to law school and taking those loans every day of my working life. It is a constant stress, I will probably never own a home, I will never have expendable income. I was young when I made that decision. I believed the false statistics concerning median incomes and the likelihood of good employment. That said, the most troublesome issue is why school prices have outpaced income in America: the private education industry and their lobbyists won legislation that keeps people from reorganizing their student loan debt through bankruptcy. This is a boon to bankers and is straightforward corruption. Giving a young person $200,000  in student loans for most degree types is clearly a bad bet, you don't need to be a banker to know that, yet lenders need not worry about sharing responsibility for the bad loan with the debtor.

So much for the conservative vote being spilt amongst everyone but Romney theory.  And by the way, Ron Paul is a Libertarian,  not a conservative.  BIG difference.  I support Romney because he has executive experience and has specialized in turning bankrupt entities around be it bankrupt companies, the Olympics, or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  His knowledge of economics is head and shoulders above the rest.  Now the Republican candidates are sponsoring TV ads that are against capitalism.  What???  The economy is the only thing that matters in this election for if it continues its downhill spiral, everthing else will be lost.  There will be no money for a strong defense, there will be no money for entitlement programs such as Medicare and social security, etc.  Harvard business school students are required to do a case study of one of Romney's business turnarounds.  On his turnaround of the Utah Olympics, it was widely reported as a miracle at the time.  How soon we forget.  Massachusetts, five years after he left office, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics, economy wise, ranks 17th in the nation.  In his four year tenure as governor, he inherited a 3 billion deficit and turned it into a 600 - 700 million surplus.

The result was that the neighborhoods where the police were shot at for doing their job became more dangerous than ever, businesses and jobs disappeared, the fires (literal fires) were no longer put out, and people stayed destitute for generations if they lived long enough. Drugs and gangs claimed more of the people living in those neighborhoods than jobs and flight to a better life. <br/><br/>The police need to be able to do their job without false accusations of racism and if they don't have the support of the people they're protecting, then those neighborhoods will become a hell on earth as a consequence. Look at Newark New Jersey or Detroit to see what that looks like; London is a wonderful city; lets hope it doesn't continue down that road.

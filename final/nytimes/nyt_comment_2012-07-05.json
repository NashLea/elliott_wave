Even a government appointed Banerjee commission came to the conclusion that the fire in the coach was accidental. Now that might or might not be true. Even if we accept your claim that the train was set on fire by a mob then it was the responsibility of the state to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice. This is what civilized societies do. What happened in Gujarat was state sponsored genocide of minorities. It is a shame for India that a person like Mr. Modi holds high office. It would be like the leader of the Ku  Klux Klan becoming a governor of some state in the USA. And you also go on to assert that state sponsored genocide acted as a deterrence against further violence. You are wrong. Very serious acts violence were committed inside the Akshardham temple and the same repeated in attacks on Ahmedabad in 2008. Even the 26/11 attackers justified their actions by citing Gujarat much like you commend state sponsored terrorism by citing Godhra as the reason. Terrorism in all its form has to be fought and condemned.

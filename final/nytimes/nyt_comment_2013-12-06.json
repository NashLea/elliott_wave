It took Egypt upsetting Italy in the second round of matches, then the US needed to beat Egypt by three clear goals at the same time as Brazil beat Italy by three, without Italy catching up in goals scored. Talk about threading the needle. All I can say is that after watching Italy rake the US 3-1, and Brazil making them look even worse at 3-0, Spain just didn't take the US seriously. The US had one of its best days, but the likelihood of such a group dynamic repeating itself at the coming World Cup is ludicrous, at best. First off, most of the Groups, even with strong seeds, are unlikely to produce a team not only winning all three matches, but in racking up a +7 Goal Difference, as Brazil did, even conceding three against Egypt. Other than a few outliers (Iran, Australia, perhaps Honduras), there is a depth in strength unprecedented in World Football. I think you can count on matches decided on close margins.<br/>There is, however, something to be said for being in a strong group.

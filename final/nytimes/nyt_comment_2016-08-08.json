How I wish the do-nothing Republicans in Congress had been pushed, relentlessly, by Krugman and all of his colleagues, shamed into action, rather than just sit out two congressional terms, allowing for millions of Americans to wither, not thrive.<br/><br/>We've known that we need to invest, stimulate, build, rebuild... We've known that Keynesian economics is our way out of the depression this Great Recession has been. We've not applied what we know. Will we now? The answer is only if that is what Clinton runs on specifically, rather than the lawyerly signalling she's been doing that no one believes. You can't pick Tim Kaine who is known to be a conservative when it comes to a lot of things and then claim to be a progressive. Kaine wants to relax Dodd Frank, was ok with paying less to social security recipients, and a host of other things that aren't progressive. <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2lP\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2lP\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2lP</a><br/><br/>Before we count our chickens, they must hatch. A Clinton win, you say? Maybe. How will such a win look in Congress? If Clinton is elected thanks to anti-Trump Republicans, will they hand her a Democratic Congress? Doubtful. If Clinton finally does the right thing and acknowledges the pain the lower middle and working classes are suffering and tries to rally them to her side, in earnest, will they vote for her and hand her, at least, a Democratic Senate? Without progressives, that calculus changes.

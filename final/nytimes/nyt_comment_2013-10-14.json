I enter into negations as a normal part of conducting business.  These negotiations take the form of either my selling or buying goods and services to or from another party.  Never, ever do these interactions involve threats that can result in actual damages to either party.  If threats of damages are made, then these interactions cease to be negotiations.  They become acts of extortion.  No one in business would voluntarily have anything to do with any party that threatens injury or damage as a part of negotiations.  In fact, such dealings are against the law and are often used in racketeering.<br/><br/>Somehow, in the insane world of politics, extortion is considered legitimate bargaining leverage.  This must not be tolerated under any circumstances.  <br/><br/>The reverse-Dixiecrat solution is weak because these same people are also victims of the extortion they support.  <br/><br/>The way to solve the extortion problem is to remove avenues of extortion from politics.  The power of the extortionists comes from the money that controls the election process.  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court is doing all it can to allow the injection of ever more money into politics from less and less diverse sources.  This concentration of election funds magnifies the power of the extortionists.  As an unintended consequence of treating money as speech, the Court has already corrupted politics with the ability to collapse the economy.

If collected, it would illustrate how many inmates and staff are killed and maimed by convicted killers, every year. The standard thought is to give them life without parole and they disappear off the scene. If it were only that easy. These killers get sent to prison, their lives are spared and they kill/maim again. Many, repeatedly. The medical and legal costs associated with these additional crimes is tremendous. What does a District Attorney do someone already serving a life without sentence for killing again?  <br/><br/>It should be an ongoing annual FBI report of how many serious assaults and deaths are caused by people in prison for any type of homicide. It won't be, but I think the public needs to know the human cost (medical care until they or their inmate victims die) of keeping these inmates alive and living among others.  Naturally, the staff garner no empathy from the public or politicians as they knew what they were getting into when they took the job.

They created conditions of non-cooperation and then blamed Obama because they wouldn't cooperate.<br/><br/>This kind of political tricksterism doesn't bother me. Much. I might in an idle moment imagine or hope that we, as fellow citizens in a cooperative nation, wouldn't play such silly games, but I know that is not realistic in our rancid political climate. What does bother me is, 1. So many people don't know the actual facts of how these things are shaped to gain political advantage and, 2. So many people accept the distorted arguments as ultimate truth and then repeat their these orchestrated conclusions in every available forum.<br/><br/>I used to wallow in daily political battles as a reporter on Capitol Hill, at the White House and elsewhere, but now that I see the stripped down truth from a safer distance, I am appalled.

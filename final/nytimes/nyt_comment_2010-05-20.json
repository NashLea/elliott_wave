This ideology has been around for centuries, since the British convinced Tamils that they were a different \"race\" from their neighbour, and that everyone else \"colonized\" \"their\" lands. However, there is no \"right of self determination,\" and you can't claim a \"homeland.\" We're living in the 21st century now, which means you need to learn to get along with your neighbour. Imagine if Martin Luther King Jr. asked for a separate \"homeland\" for blacks. The result of Tamil Nationalism / Fascisism that there are Tamil Fascist movements in India (DMK and Vaiko's \"race war\" speeches, who hopes for a separate \"homeland\" to be carved out of India for Tamils, but excluding Muslim Tamils), Malaysia (HINDRAF, a banned Tamil extremist party who has similar aims), Singapore, London, UK (Tamil enforcer gangs VVT and AK Kannan which worked with the LTTE), Toronto Canada (where VVT and AK Kannan are also active, and where Tamil extremists get most of the funds) and Australia. Recently, a Tamil newspaper was torched by Tamil extremists who disliked the newspaper's message of reconciliation:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/769117--tamil-newspaper-s-scarborough-office-attacked\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thestar.com...</a><br /><br />Tamils were treated badly in Sri Lanka.

They have no regard for the law so what makes you think they will adhere to any other law in the US?? They are exhausting our social services and taxing our justice system. Enough already. I support AZ law completely. People that choose to boycott AZ for chosing to enforce the law are hypocritical.

The reality, however, was quite the opposite- anyone with a handling of reality knows that the Bush Administration's policies in the Middle East, and in particular the decision to invade Iraq, were not the Fourteen Points risen from the dead, but  cold-hearted realpolitik designed to strengthen the United States' position in the region (for whatever real motive, be it oil, or some other strategic aim, of which we will sadly never know for sure). This is not to say that the U.S. Middle East policy during the Bush years was either good or bad, misguided Wilsonianism/security reality or evil oil executives, but let's not pretend for one second that what Bush spoke of was the White House's actual policy. More importantly, let's not pretend that this revolution is anything less than  the inevitable flourishing of freedom and liberty that is bound to occur in any oppressed state.

You know the one, where we sold arms to the Iranians (our stated enemies) and to take the proceeds and fund the contras in Nicaragua, with the stated aim of replacing one undemocratic regime with another, but one 'friendlier' to our 'interests.' Sorry, Abrams wouldn't recognize democracy if it kneed him in the groin.<br /><br />And then on you go to Charles Krauthammer, who has four points in his 'freedom agenda.'

How's all that working out after a decade (in Afghanistan, whose government could not continue in power without our propping) and eight years in Iraq?<br /><br />The only way that Bush's approach in Afghanistan and in Iraq even vaguely resembles what has happened in Egypt and in Tunisia is that the final effect has been regime change. And, in Egypt, Mubarak is only put out because the military has staged a coup. A military coup? In Egypt? Who could have seen that coming? In 1952, King Farouk was deposed in a military coup led by General Gamel Abdel Nasser. After the disastrous six day war, Nasser was cashiered and replaced by General Anwar El Sadat. After Sadat was assassinated by reactionaries furious about Sadat's attempt to make peace with Israel, Air Force General Hosni Mubarak took power. It is entirely unclear whether the military can be replaced by a democracy. Please read Nick Kristof's work. Could we be seeing a case of, as Pete Townshend put it: \"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\"<br /><br />Yeah, Bush 'accomplished' in a decade or in eight years what the Tunisian and Egyptian people facilitated in weeks, without the expenditure of a trillion dollars and without the loss of thousands of American lives, and without  permanently disabling  over 100000 Americans.

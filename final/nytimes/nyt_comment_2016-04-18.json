Imaginably, even from the dawn of philosophy, there may have been those who've disregarded developed thought,  projected through lengthy, convoluted sentences,  appearing irrelevant  to the here and now.<br/>Though admittedly drawn to philosophy,  at times leaning upon it, the well written article on \"Is That Even a Thing\" aids me in understanding all those whose lips curl up and brows bunch over critical,  when anyone waxes philosophical.<br/>Please take this not as a critique, for I am not nearly in the position of passing criticism on any doctoral candidate in philosophy rather, I would hope, that this thing that we're doing here, this repartee of sorts, would draw attention to the need for the interjection of philosophical thought in our daily lives, our private lives and the way we live as a community, locally and globally.<br/>While at very deep meaningful levels, the understanding of how we have come to use the term \"thing\" might unlock heretofore hidden expanses of neurology and the \"behavior\" of our thought,  there remain other areas of existential relevance that philosophy may  contribute to.<br/>Philosophers,  see the relevance of you're studies. Share it with us lip-curled, bunched-brow skeptics, one sentence at a time, then maybe \"things\" will be a bit nicer for all.

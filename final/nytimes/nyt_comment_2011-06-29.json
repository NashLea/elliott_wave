In fact, we are not.<br/>\nAs with many other phenomena, the time between diagnosis and death for each of the different known end-of-life conditions (end-stage heart failure, advanced dementia, metastatic/terminal cancer, etc) occurs on its own normal curve or some close variant thereof.  It is appropriate, rather than appalling, that 19% of people placed on hospice outlive their six-month \u201clife expectancy.\u201d  Statistically, these folks encapsulate the tail of their disease\u2019s bell curve.  And individually, they often represent victories for the hospice modality of care.  Aside from the small number of cases of frank Medicare fraud out there, hospice six-month-survivors are anything but \"mistakes.\"  Just ask them.<br/>\nIf our society considered it a waste of resources to have wrongly placed some folks on hospice who ultimately make it past six months, and thereby increased the \u201cseverity-of-illness\u201d threshold we use for offering hospice care benefits, then many people in desperate need of this modality of care would miss out.  Though our ability as physicians to predict remaining time for individuals is limited, what we CAN bring to the table is a reasonable approximation of the point after which further interventions (even the act of hospitalization itself) will no longer be of help to the patient.

Sounds just like today's mark inflation at university.  Any surprise that most DC public school teachers evaluated now get worse marks than before, when administrators feared looking bad?<br/><br/>My high school over 50 years ago, was nothing like the average inner-city zoo that so many now attend.  We had weekly tests in every subject.  Tests were marked on a 100-point scale.  An monthly average of 60 was pass.  No marking on a curve.  Those who did not work flunked out.  We graduated 230 after starting 700 in 7th grade plus sizeable new in-take in 9th grade.  The school was designed solely to get student performance.  Work or loaf, students whose performance on tested content was under 60% left. The good part was it was real-world. <br/><br/>As for teachers, few were really good, most were average, but covered the assigned curriculum without deviating.  Maybe 20% to 25% were a lot less good than they might have been.  Those 20% or 25% usually mistook showing us how much they knew for actually teaching us something.  This was especially common among math teachers.  A few students followed and got really high marks (90% or better), but most were right at 60% or less.  ( From one less good teacher's class to another, the few making 90% or better were not over 3 out of 36.)  <br/><br/>University had very few really good profs.  Most, however, were good.  But again 20% to 25% mistook showing us how much they knew for actual teaching.  <br/><br/>So there is lots of room for improved teaching in public primary and secondary schools.  Then with improved teaching, it is only fair to flunk students who for whatever reason cannot keep up .  Passing should signify subject mastery, not a meaningless, social promotion for just holding on year after year.  The US economy is less self-contained than in 1958.  Now import duties do not protect unskilled US workers from competition by unskilled foreign workers.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2906806, "replies": [], "lft": 44, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-emphasizes-aim-to-close-indian-point-plant.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4071586, "rgt": 45, "userDisplayName": "baseballbill730", "createDate": "1309320949", "userID": 56167562, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1309321518", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Matthews, NC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1309317918", "commentSequence": 21, "commentBody": "A perfect example of why America is spiraling downward.

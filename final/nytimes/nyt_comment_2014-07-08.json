It is simply an elevated vacuum pipe that allows Maglev to propel the payload at fantastic speeds by riding the AC wave until it leaves the tube.  There are thermal problems, even at very high altitudes but we believe we have those conquered.  The satellites have been designed and the microwave transmission has been tested.  We don't want to detract from solar and wind, in fact I am all for solar roof tops, but the problem is the sun doesn't always shine and there are many days that clouds prevent full efficiency.  There may be breakthroughs in Thorium power, which would also work but I think this century the entire planet should make an effort to curtail global warming gasses.  The US could use this challenge to create more jobs.  We are coming along with electric transport but the real issue is highway freight trucks, the Maglev network project target.

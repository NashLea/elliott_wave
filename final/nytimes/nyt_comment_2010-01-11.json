It will focus on stimulating international support for Yemen\u2019s\u2019 effort in the fight against terrorism, and to gain support for a comprehensive reform. The task has become more difficult because problems are so deep and huge. The attendees are representatives from forty-three nations and should discuss the causes young Yemenis to join extremist militant organizations. They should focus on the factors that make Yemen a new base for these extremist movements and make tribes provide protection for them. These causes and factors are:<br /><br />1.\tPeople are angry at the government for many reasons. There is a gap between the living standard in Yemen and the neighbor Arab Gulf countries; the unemployment rate is more than 37%; half the population is living in poverty; the economy is collapsing without a specific strategy to lift the country out of crises; corrupted justice system; corrupted military and security systems; the absence of security services in many areas across the country; no plan to secure the short supply of water, no alternative plan for the oil revenue which expect to run out in a decade; the concentration of power in the hands of relatives.<br />2.\tTribes live in permanent wars with each other and with authority. Therefore tribesmen are well trained as soldiers and represent a valuable source for recruiters.<br />3.\tWeapons trade is everywhere.<br />4.\tYemen is the ancestral home of Osama Bin Laden and some leaders of Al-Qaeda belong to big tribes.<br />5.\tAl-Houthi rebels are battling government forces in Saada governorate since 2004. This extremist group gets support from Iran and from Shiite groups across the region such as Hezbollah.<br />6.\tMany Yemenis have lived in Saudi Arabia for many years. Most of these people have experienced humiliation with no human rights. This situation has created a fertile ground for terrorist\u2019s recruiters.<br />7.\tMany Yemenis in the south were trained ideology by the Soviet Union as militants and special service agents. After the reunification of the north and south in 1990, these experts lost their jobs and interests. Their experiences and expertise are valuable now for terrorist organizations.<br />8.\tEven though everybody around the world has seen some of Al-Qaeda leaders in front of the television cameras with tribesmen around them, government is still sensitive about declaring a real war.<br />9.\tThe opposition groups leading by the Islamic Brotherhood (Islah), the Socialist party and others (Coalition for Reform) are trying to make the situation worse and worse.<br />10.\t Separatist campaign in the south with absence of local authority.<br />11.\tCorruption and instability which prevent Arab Gulf States and others to invest in Yemen makes the economical crises so huge.<br />12.\tThe strategic location in the Bab al-Mandab strait and in the south corner of the Gulf countries.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1040405, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/afc-divisional-playoff-matchups/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1394748, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "mivogo", "createDate": "1263189738", "userID": 37234670, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1263190287", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new york city", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1263190287", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "The Chargers have not scored less than 20 points in a game all year.

The Bloomberg administration should go away and mind its own business taking care of New York City, not go on a nationwide prohibitionist campaign against salt.<br /><br />Personally, I like salt.  I cook with basic ingredients -- fresh vegetables and meats -- and control the amount of salt I use to my taste and to what I consider healthy.  I am aware of the health issues.  If you don't like salt or think it's unhealthly, don't use it! And packaged foods already are labeled with their sodium content.  Read the labels before you buy them.  There is a hazy continuum between well-meaning encouragement to coersion to opression.  We've gone down that road as a nation before with other things.  Treat us like adults.

I choose my bread for its low-salt content, usually 100 - 115 milligrams of salt per slice. I note that bread products with fruit in them (raisin bread, raisin or blueberry bagels) contain less salt.<br /><br />I welcome the effect of New York's program on foods available elsewhere, It would be nice to see more choice in reduced-salt foods, and perhaps fewer will be withdrawn from grocery shelves.

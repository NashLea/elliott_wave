As one of the architects of the disastrous Bush tax cuts, your tax policy has caused our deficits to balloon. It was unwise policy.<br/><br/>Deficit spending during times of recession is necessary. The stimulus of 2009-10 help save or create millions of jobs, but prominent economists like Joseph Stiglitz pointed out the stimulus was too small. That\u2019s why we are limping along in this economy. Stiglitz made the case for more stimulus in a 2010 interview with Democracy Now:<br/><br/>\u201cIf we don\u2019t stimulate the economy, the economy is going to get WEAKER. When the economy gets weaker, tax revenues go down and expenditures go up. Already, more than 40 million Americans are on food stamps. The number of people on Medicaid is reaching record levels. So, revenues go down, expenditures go up, deficits get worse. If you stimulate the economy, then people get jobs, they spend money, tax revenues go up.<br/><br/>\u201cIf we spend the money on investments in education, technology, infrastructure, you GROW the economy in the short run from the stimulus, you GROW the economy in the long term because of the returns that you get on these investments. Think about this from the point of view of a firm. If you are a firm and you could borrow at 0 to 2/12 percent, which is what the government can borrow, and you have investment opportunities that yield 10, 15, 20 percent, you would be irresponsible, you would be foolish, not to undertake those investments.\u201d", "recommendationCount": 354}, {"assetID": 3379320, "replies": [], "lft": 81, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/booming/lessons-learned-when-its-all-over.html", "parentID": 9693566, "commentID": 9704714, "rgt": 84, "userDisplayName": "Concerned Citizen", "createDate": "1376278231", "userID": 11228992, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1376280051", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Anywheresville", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1376276451", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "@Mike Winerip: you are exploiting other people's pain here -- plain and simple.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3379320, "replies": [], "lft": 82, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/booming/lessons-learned-when-its-all-over.html", "parentID": 9704714, "commentID": 9704833, "rgt": 83, "userDisplayName": "Mike Winerip", "createDate": "1376280051", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": null, "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1376280051", "userTitle": "Booming", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": null, "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1376276451", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "The only people we write about are people willing to be interviewed and only cases where both members of the relationship are comfortable using their names.

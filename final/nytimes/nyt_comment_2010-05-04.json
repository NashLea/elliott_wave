Reading the bill (as many who have posted on this topic for and against it surely have) will not magically tell you everything you need to know about how a law will be enforced.<br /><br />\"Reasonable suspicion\" is not an undefinable term, but it IS based on context.

This is true, but there is absolutely NO guidance as to what other \"reasonable\" criteria may be used.  And the fact that the bill allows race to be taken into account means exactly what it sounds like for those who are \"reading the bill\": race can be a factor in developing reasonable suspicion.<br /><br />Thus, if I am a local officer and I think that most illegals I have encountered wear cheap looking jeans, this, combined with the fact that the person is Latino, could be the basis for the officer to ask for a person's papers.  I will have to justify my suspicion in court, but if a (also local, and probably up for reelection by a mostly white electorate) judge who is also concerned about illegal immigration defers to my judgment as a local officer, I will have passed the reasonable suspicion test.<br /><br />Take this example and combine it with any number of factors including type of car being driven, type of hairstyle, certain smell, place where \"illegals\" typically hang out, and you have the makings of a race based police state.<br /><br />This is what people are concerned about.<br /><br />If your response is, well, most illegal immigrants are Latino, why yes, that is true, but another thing that is true is that even in Arizona, the VAST MAJORITY of Latinos are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants.

I also find it scary writing about this personal problem, but addiction is a public health problem that needs to transform into public policy, because there are millions of addicted people out there and more millions who have been directly or indirectly affected -- and there is no way all of us are bad parents who caused this awful disease.<br /><br />I support you in every way. I hope that you and I and all the other millions of us can shed a light on this terrible problem that is taking too many of a whole generation of young people.<br /><br />My public story is at <a href=\"http://spittingrits.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">spittingrits.blogspot.com</a>.

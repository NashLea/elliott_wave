It seems to refer to an esthetic or psychological experience. Yes, there are aspects of the religious experience that everyone can identify with--the need for atonement; a quest for absolutes; a desire to find personal meaning within a purposeful, larger framework; a need for some ultimate caring in the universe. But within religion, all these experiences seem short-circuited by the knowledge dimension. Answers are given,  not just in creeds but in devotion to religious mystery. For the unbeliever, there is never a clear answer. To my mind, the most satisfying psychological and esthetic experiences are independent of this \"knowledge\" or belief base, and they entertain doubt and ambiguity.

John Stott was one of the authors who explained my faith to me when I first became a Christian. Perhaps it's because I subscribed to his brand of evangelicalism that I find myself so disappointed and disillusioned in my fellow Christians these days. Evangelicals are now known more for their negative stances on homosexuality and abortion and their Republican politics than they are for helping the poor. The very definition of evangelical pre-supposes a belief in the Bible as the inerrant Word of God, and yet many proponents appear to be able to ignore the repeated instructions of Jesus regarding social justice in their holy book. How do they interpret a verse like: \"Whatever you do unto the least of these, you do unto me,\" I wonder?

Mr. Stott has many brilliant peers that carry on his tradition of scholarship mixed with practical application of the Christian faith. To anyone interested I would recommend the works of Tim Keller, Dallas Willard, Ravi Zacharias and N.T. Wright. Jesus remains the most dominant figure in history for a reason. Those of us attempting to follow Him continually fall short of the bar he set but we won't stop trying to put his teachings into practice.

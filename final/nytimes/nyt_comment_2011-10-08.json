During the late Middle Ages and Early Modern period, Slovakia - located on the north bank of the Danube - was directly in the path of whatever Asian army attempting to invade Europe. It is undeniably a poor country (or at least it was), thanks largely to the fact that it has been a pawn among the \"Great Powers\" for centuries. The Hungarians and Austrians exploited and deprived the Slovakians of most political rights for several centuries, and then in the 20th Century union of Czechoslvakia, they were regarded as the poor, ignorant cousins of the ethnic Czechs and Moravians. During the Soviet era, they were designated as a supplier of raw materials and cheap labor to their Communist neighbors.  Despite the pain and dislocation it caused, the split from what is now the Czech Republic has allowed the ethnic Slovaks to develop their national character and their own institutions for the first time in over a thousand years.  It is really difficult for any people to be truly \"international\" or \"transnational\" if they are not comfortable in their \"national\" skins.<br/><br/>Give 'em some time.  They've done wonders in the past 17-18 years and will continue to do so.

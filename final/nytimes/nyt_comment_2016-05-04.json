Obama's  8 years of over reaching executive power, profligate spending, and apologizing for America at every turn has weakened us on the national stage and unleashed a new revolution amongst the angry, the unemployed, and the hopeless youth of our nation.  Hence, the birth of the likes of the populist Trump.<br/>    I find myself in the unfortunate position of having to hold my nose and vote for this reality show candidate not because I like or agree with his policies  but because he is a better choice than Mrs. Clinton who is on the verge of federal indictment and possible incarceration.

It is what has been broadcast as such, but ground troops are the ones who coined this term. Our troops have to fight the same enemy combatants over &amp; over again.  Please search for my husband's name on the web to find out more. CNN uncovered that in the Iraq War, 87,000 were detained, but 77,000 were released.<br /><br />I have heard of this movie and would like to see it, but my time is consumed with campaigning for support....for the release of 3 American Soldiers now imprisoned at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Perhaps this movie does not represent everything Iraq Veterans think it should, but I certainly hope someone will represent the FLAWS of this war at some point.  Now that, is certainly worthy of the making of a movie.  Please Americans, don't forget that March 16th was the anniversary of the Iraq war.  It's not a monumental day for me, since I live, breath and eat this war, every day since April 17, 2009.  Defend our soldiers.<br /><br />How many of the fallen soldiers in the Iraq War, were taken by \"second chancers\"?  Just how many IED's or VBIED's can be planted and detonated by just one.............just one, second chancer?  Think about this.  Think about the number of fallen soldiers.  Also, think about the ones in Afghanistan, where over 75% of deaths are caused by IED's.  See the \"96th Hour Rule\" covered by CNN and the fact that General Petraeus just the other day, admitted to the Senate Arms Committee that \"it is yet another flawed policy and simply does not work\".  General Petraues a day later, mentions again that another policy is flawed and does not work and is being overhauled in Afghanistan, regarding the training and utilization of Iraqi' police.  When I am able to gain the release of all 3 of our soldiers, which one is my husband \"John Hatley\", then I'll sit down to watch this movie.<br /><br />KimHatley (3/20/2010)<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 6}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

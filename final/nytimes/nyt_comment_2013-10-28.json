The indication that this is true is contained in this very article, in the caption of the photograph \"Mr. Capa called 'the last man to die' in the war.\" If Mr. Capa meant this literally then it cannot possibly be true, as the German forces surrendered piecemeal well into May, including units on the Western Front. It can't be possible that the soldier pictured, killed in mid-April,  was in fact the last man to die in the war.

The odds of winning the PowerBall lottery are probably better. <br/><br/>I take Capa's statement about \"the last man\" to mean that the photo is a representation, an interpretation, of the idea of the last man killed in the war. He is alone, no other signs of war around him. It is quiet, peaceful, and then he is struck and falls and as he lies dying on the floor he hears the shot that killed him, fired by an unseen foe who will melt away and the war will be over. Whether \"Death of a ...Militiaman\" was \"real\" or posed or a photo of a man who simply fell while running downhill, it still represents the idea of a man at the instant of death in battle. <br/><br/>I think it was Hemingway who said that the best fiction is more true than the facts.

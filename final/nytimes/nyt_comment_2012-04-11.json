Listen, I;m no fan of Santorum or his ideology.   I'm just analyzing it purely from a political perspective.  <br/><br/>Frankly, Santorum chose an opportune moment to call it quits.  Let's be honest.  His political career was over after he lost his Senate re-election bid badly in 2006.  No one expected Santorum to do as well as he did running for president this year - he surprised a lot of people by doing much better than anticipated (winning I beleive 11 states).<br/><br/>I remember the early debates when he was placed at the end of the stage and hardly had any questions directed at him.  By the last debate, Santorum was standing right next to Willard Mittford \"4-Car Garage\" Romney.<br/><br/>If Romney loses the general election to President Obama, Santorum would be regarded as one of the front-runners for 2016 - together with Romney's VP choice.<br/><br/>So Santorum's political career has been revived and has a future.<br/><br/>But if Santorum had proceeded with his campaign, and then lost the Pennsylvania primary, he would have squandered all the goodwill and everything else gained to date.  <br/><br/>A loss in his home state would have once again ended his politcal career.  <br/><br/>So it appears Bella's illness gave him an opportunity to leave the race gracefully, with dignity and preserve a significant upside for a political future.

I think that Yahoo signed its death certificate with their lawsuit against Facebook for infringing patents.

This seems like a move of desperation on Yahoo's part because this type of act really damages Yahoo's perception in the tech community, which is already quite low. I think that a lot of people will even perceive this type of move as jealousy on Yahoo's part. Facebook is quite successf, is heading towards a monster IPO, and has received so much hype amongst businesses that there's dozens of companies listed at <a href=\"http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com\" title=\"http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com</a> that do nothing but promote Facebook business pages. Nothing that Yahoo has done in years has inspired any kind of similar passion and Yahoo is filled with some really horrible product managers that have squandered big-time opportunities with their key properties. Yahoo really does feel like a rudderless ship right now and I think this was a big mistake.

I believe the special forces now employ a similar tactic when they are engaged by superior numbers. It involves a reflex type assault with a huge burst of automatic weapons. If Marines employ similar tactics it is because all assault type troops know they are safest when they are mobile and attacking in many situations. If Airborne troops could use this tactic against trained German soldiers with accurate rifles it could be used against Taliban militia. The real issue is U.S. troops would be more at risk from Taliban with rifles on auto closer in but U.S. troops should still prevail in closer shot out because of superior auto fire training. Would the advantage be worth the extra casualties? In the long term yes because the best way to counter insurgents is not to do predictable things on any level over the long term.<br /><br />In the Pacific the Japanese used a similar reflex assault tactic on patrol and suffered high casualties because U.S. troops would set up machine gun ambushes initiated by rifle fire to lure the charging Japanese in. So such a tactic should just be one of many that a commander can call on and not be used all the time.<br /><br />I agree with you about Motors. The only issue that need to be dealt with is the huge amount of supply and protective gear our troops now have to hump around with.

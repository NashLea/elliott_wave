My personal experience has been with one company, The Sprout People, who have been in business for many years.\r<br/><br/>After reading many of the negative comments that followed I contacted the company &amp; asked them to weigh in.\r<br/><br/>I heard from them immediately--and here's what they had to say about home sprouting with THEIR TESTED CERTIFIED SEEDS.   Everyone can decide for themselves, but I'm going to continue to sprout at home--which are the ONLY sprouts I eat.\r<br/><br/>\"In light of the recent pathogenic outbreak in Germany, that has been Inked to Mung Bean sprouts, we want to advise our customers that the safest food is that which you prepare in your own home. \r<br/><br/>As long as your Sprouter is clean, your hands are clean and you are using a clean water source such as tap water, you can be assured of the highest level of safety. \r<br/><br/>Some people may wish to take THE added precaution of adding to the soak water one quarter cup of white vinegar per quart of water or a few drops  of Grapefruit Seed Extract (<a href=\"http://sproutpeople.org/supply/odds/gse.html)\" title=\"http://sproutpeople.org/supply/odds/gse.html)\" target=\"_blank\">http://sproutpeople.org/supply/odds/gse.html)</a>.  Either of these two sanitizers can be added to the soak water and will clean the seed's outer coat. \r<br/><br/>We want to remind you that buying seed from an organic source also increases your safety, since organic seeds are required to be handled in a much safer way than conventionally grown seed.  \r<br/><br/>None of the tests conducted on the German bean sprouts showed contamination. However, after erroneously accusing Spanish cucumbers,  the German authorities focused their attention on Mung Bean sprouts.   \r<br/><br/>As is the case with epidemiological analysis, even if the lab tests don't prove conclusive, circumstantial evidence is used to determine the answer.  \r<br/><br/>In this case, as in too many that have preceded it, sprouts were blamed, based solely on information collected about where and what people ate, regardless of the tests coming back clean.  They will probably never know for certain what food was involved.\r<br/><br/>All of our seeds have been tested and are free of pathogenic bacteria.  We eat sprouts grown from the same seeds we sell to you, as we always have and as our children and pets always have.  We continue to eat them without fear, and always will.\r<br/><br/>Be well and happy.\r<br/><br/>Gil and Lori<br/>\nSproutpeople", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2839887, "replies": [], "lft": 58, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/blaming-sprouts-again/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3989192, "rgt": 59, "userDisplayName": "anna", "createDate": "1307998172", "userID": 63489523, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1308024089", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "new york", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1308020489", "commentSequence": 25, "commentBody": "\"Healthy Librarian is incorrect\"#19<br/>\nNo, no, no.

Too bad for all the regular citizens of this country. Those two Presidents took on the Wall Street insiders and bankers. They stood up for working class citizens against the Republicans and their banking interest supporters. Just one example: President Roosevelt put in place programs that actually worked to save homes and farms from foreclosure including my grandfather's house on the Southside of Chicago.  Our family will never forget that. And millions of families who have now lost their homes to foreclosure will never forget that President Obama did little or nothing to help them.  If Roosevelt could find a way to do it, why can't Obama? Because the banks opposed it and still oppose it, the very same banks which precipitated the financial collapse, the very same banks whose financial support Obama now seems to think he needs to get reelected. Finally, please don't tell me Obama needed to restore the banks to financial health, for God's sake. His highest priority should have been to save the homeowners.

Caproni, has ignored the power given to the President's Foreign Intelligence Board (PFIAB) and their subcommittee; The Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB).  Presidential Executive Order #12863 was first signed by President Ford in 1975. This Presidential Order established an independent oversight committee to monitor and report directly to the President if the intelligence community breaks any laws or does not adhere to Presidential Orders or Directives.<br/>\n   Presidential Executive Order 12863 has been modified by Presidents following his term. For example, President Clinton modified EO #12863 in 1993. Then in 2005, President Bush, amended Executive Order #12863 and the number changed from Executive Order #12683 to Executive Order #13376. However, in 2008, President Bush again amended the Executive Order #13376 and renamed it for a second time to President Executive Order #13462.<br/>\n  In conclusion, President Bush Executive Order #13462 of Feb. 29, 2008 re-establishing the Presidents Intelligence Advisory Board and Intelligence Oversight Board allows the IOB to investigate the F.B.I, C.I.A., N.S.A. and others insuring that our United States Constitution is being followed.  In the United States Archives, <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov\" title=\"www.archives.gov\" target=\"_blank\">www.archives.gov</a>, Volume 73, No. 43, March 4, 2008 is where the Presidential Executive Order #13462 amended by President Bush is stored.  Under the official section of the IOB powers, I quote the Executive order, \"(b) inform the President of Intelligence activities that the IOB believes:<br/>\n(i)(A) may be unlawful or contrary to Executive Order or Presidential Directive;\"<br/>\nThe F.B.I. by enacting and giving F.B.I. agents complete authority to do what ever they want clearly violates \"Presidential Executive Order #13462 signed into law by President Bush\" and that violation is punishable by law. The F.B.I. has directly disobeyed direct orders enacted by the President.

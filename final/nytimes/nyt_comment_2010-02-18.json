I got pounded on this blog by the Walsh/D'Antoni supporters for saying they were wrong in both their treatment of Nate Robinson, and for the direction in which they were taking the team.  Now the naked emperor, Walsh has been revealed.  There simply was no excuse for passing on point guards such as Brandon Jennings and Ty Lawson.  Even if they considered Jennings a project... Jordan Hill over Ty Lawson??????  Look, I like Hill and I like Toney Douglas.  I saw Douglas play (really for the first time) in the ACC tourney a year ago and fell in love with his game.  Maybe he'll pan out... maybe Hill will too, but right not he looks an awful lot like Reynaldo Balkman all over again... except Balkman actually got on the court to vindicate Isaiah from time to time.  Hill, bless his heart is a very rough diamond.<br /><br />Walt (Bennett #4), I think you better make right with The Lord because I actually 'recommended' something you posted.  I totally agree with you and GKR (#15)... and I pray that this move falls thru.  I can't possibly see what \"boost\" McGrady could give the Knicks and I refuse to cheer them putting a Band-Aid where a tourniquet is needed.  Even if this is a salary dump (Robert #24, you're not the only one following this courtship of McGrady) it's still a bad move because of the draft picks.  McGrady will never again play for the Rockets... why are they even in position to demand anything??  Deep down inside they'll be happy to get whatever they can in return for McGrady... who (not wishing him ill) could very well turn out to be another Anfernee Hardaway or Grant Hill... once great players whose trajectories were interrupted by injuries.<br /><br />Then the kicker... ESPN is reporting that a trade of Nate Robinson to the Celtics for Eddie House and some other warm body is in the works....

I am grateful that we are able to do this because I am lucky enough to make enough to support the whole family, and he is much better at being a stay-at-home parent than I am. To all you commenters who say that men aren't as nurturing and they just will never be as good as women at taking care of the kids, I couldn't disagree with you more.  I think that there are cultural stigmas that force men (and women) to act in certain ways, but on a case by case basis, sometimes the man of a couple might be the better caregiver and sometimes the woman. In our case, my husband is more patient, more able to ham it up and have a good time with the kids and more able to deal with the routine that the children need. I love my kids more than I can explain, but when I am the primary caregiver on the weekends, I am so ready to go back to work on Monday.  And the thing is, my husband is a totally macho, handy-man, guy's guy. So, my point here is that our biology allows us a lot more flexibility than Mr. Brooks or many commenters would suggest. I think what we should be aiming for is a culture in which we support and accept that the best person for the job of primary caregiver may be a man or a woman. That doesn't mean that I think that this is the solution for the devastation that many men are experiencing in the current economy. If they would be miserable and resentful staying home with the kids, they shouldn't do it unless there aren't other options. But any man wants to be the primary caretaker of his children, has the support of his partner and thinks that he would be good at it, let's support that man in doing the most important job there is (raising the kids, that is).", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1173107, "replies": [], "lft": 448, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/why-househusbands-are-the-future/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1582941, "rgt": 449, "userDisplayName": "Jennifer", "createDate": "1266455036", "userID": 56647448, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266471950", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Wayland MA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266471950", "commentSequence": 205, "commentBody": "How about;  people do worthwhile work that they're good at, and make time for raising their kids and running the household . . . together?<br /><br />And businesses recognize that people have lives outside of the workplace.

How do we then explain years of feminist opposition to the stay at home lifestyle? You mean it's okay to have no career of your own? That's emphatically not what feminists have been saying for the past 50 years. Feminists have insisted that the entire concept of a stay at home parent was outdated. Are we now saying they were wrong?<br /><br />Gloria Steinem said: \" a decent job is a basic human right for everybody\"<br /><br />By \"everybody\" did she mean only females?<br /><br />The book, The Two Career Couple, asserted: \"Women who hold jobs by choice, even blue-collar routine jobs, are more satisfied with their lives than are full-time housewives.\"<br /><br />This was quoted by Ms. Steinem by means of illustrating how important it was to work outside the home. How can you now tell men that they should not work outside the home?<br /><br />She also wrote, in stressing the value of working outside the home, \"In addition to personal satisfaction, there is also society's need for ALL it's members' talents\"<br /><br />She and all feminists have stressed how working outside the home was essential for both personal fulfillment and essential for society to get the best use of all it's citizens talents. I think ALL means both men and women.<br /><br />In her essay, \"The Importance of Work\" she wrote of the Full Employment Act of 1946: \"Full employment was officially defined as 'the employment of those who want to work, without regard to whether their employment is, by some definition, necessary. This goal applies equally to men and women.\"<br /><br />So now after years of insisting on the importance, the necessity of work outside the home, the same feminists are telling men to totally forget everything they've been telling women about how essential it is to have a career.

However, with the advent of the Pill (more precise control) and the dawn of an era where societies finally appreciate the contribution of half of their population, women now have even more opportunity to be selective. And they are selecting men who are more willing to be nurturing, to be involved parents and to do chores.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious if you look at people under 40 all around NYC. I am not sure how that's working in the rest of the country, but I suspect that this phenomenon is irreversible. Thank god. It's better for everyone to be able to express all of their sides, be egalitarian and raise children who receive support from as many places as they can get it!

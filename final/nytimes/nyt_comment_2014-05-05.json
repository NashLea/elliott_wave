The similarities are remarkable.  When I was 17 years old, I killed a newlywed motorcyclist in front of his wife by making a swift left-land turn in front of him.  I was not speeding, drunk, or texting, but I was distracted by searching for a building on the left side of the road.  I \"got away with it\" by only being charged with minor traffic violations (\"failure to yield\"), but I spent  years in treatment for PTSD, and, like the author, I also used EMDR in my recovery. The crash defined me for a long time. I still wake up with weights in my chest. I think of his wife and parents constantly.  <br/><br/>It's tough to read all the comments about how the punishments for these drivers should be much harsher, to serve as a deterrent  against distraction. I don't know that this is useful. The people I relate to most are the parents who have left babies in hot cars (recall Gene Weingarten's Pulizter prize-winning piece \"Fatal Distraction\").  If I had been drunk or texting, it would be easy for me to pinpoint something in myself that I could fix, that I could adequately punish. I realize this offends our sense of justice, that if I kill someone and only get a small fine, I've \"gotten away\" with it. But what else is there? I've spent a long time proving to myself that I will never, ever get away with it, but I'm left unsatisfied and heavyhearted.

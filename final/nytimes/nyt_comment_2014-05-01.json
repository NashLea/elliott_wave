Some decades ago, it seemed that corporations, at least many of them, were willing to abide by some degree of regulation, but now it seems that any regulation whatever is to be fought tooth-and-nail. <br/><br/>Why the difference? Perhaps it's because union power, now practically non-existent, helped keep corporations in line and made them responsible partners in American industry. Or perhaps it was that Americans were better informed about the role of government vis a vis capitalism. And also Congress was not so beholden to corporate largesse to win elections then.

The one issue of concern to me, where money should not talk, is the ability of the wealthy to go more quickly through government-mandated security, i.e., the metals detectors and luggage scanners.  The long lines exist because we refuse to devote sufficient resurces such that there are no  lines.   How difficult would it be to add more machines and employees during the rush?  But we don't, and thus, the demand is created, and the ability for someone to make money by selling access to a shorter line.  They call those shorter lines different names, usually by some precious metal or exclusive membership status.

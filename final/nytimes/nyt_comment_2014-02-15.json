Employers, such as the US military, can institute rules that place reasonable limits on speech, and private individuals can make rules banning lots of kinds of speech in their home.

Doubtless, you will get flak for this one statement, since the homophobic culture that privileges heterosexual males, cannot abide the idea that emotional and sexual energy are related, especially in same-sex groups.  More and more the sexuality of any individual is being seen not only as generalized attraction, but as the expression of one's romantic aspirations.  To the extent that straight men, whatever their intensely homosocial bonding behavior is in the locker room, can also define their sexuality as an aspiration for the person each of them loves, the acceptance of gays in traditionally straight male bonding groups might help women get more respect, too.  \"Straight\" might come to mean the desire for an opposite-sex special someone, rather than a proclivity to objectify and demean women as a whole group.", "recommendationCount": 31}, {"assetID": 3394570, "replies": [], "lft": 335, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/sports/football/investigation-finds-pattern-of-harassment-in-dolphins-locker-room.html", "parentID": 11167512, "commentID": 11167623, "rgt": 336, "userDisplayName": "Allen Roth", "createDate": "1392440642", "userID": 25010688, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1392441902", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1392441902", "commentSequence": 11167623, "commentBody": "El wrongo.

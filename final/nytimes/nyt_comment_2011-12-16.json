Regardless of domestic concerns, the US shouldn't wash its hands off the region. Af-Pak region has to be stabilized.

If a nations military is intended to protect its borders, shouldn't border emplacements be some of the best equipped? Unfortunately, for them, these poor soldiers were nothing but poorly paid pawns of their national elite. Not much different than US troops in that regard. And, now, that the Pakistani elite has sacrificed some pawns, they seek to cry foul. If they cared about their troops, they'd have equipped them with SAMs and positioned them in a network in which support was a minute away. They didn't, because they don't care about protecting their borders. They think that have bigger fish to fry. And thus, they have no point.<br/><br/>Any national elite, including ours, that places any interest above protecting the welfare of its national population, has no point!", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3295585, "replies": [], "lft": 557, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/magazine/bill-keller-pakistan.html", "parentID": 5071104, "commentID": 5076521, "rgt": 558, "userDisplayName": "Sid", "createDate": "1323979014", "userID": 57613450, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1324012845", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Toronto", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1324012846", "commentSequence": 163, "commentBody": "So what exactly is your point?

Fencing the border will remove all the objections you Americans and Afghans have against Pakistan.

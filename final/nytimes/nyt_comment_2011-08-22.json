Your policies, collectively, are anathema to this nation's success; your actions (including the over-regulating of industry, embedding your Party with corrupt Unions, your meme-speak that demonizes Corporations as 'not even people' and demonizes the 'rich' as 'not paying their fair share') are plain-spoken enough: Leftists who now control the once-proud Democratic party desire only to buy votes and support from community-organized Moochers using Other People's Money.

It has to do with how men and women are defined as \"leaders\" or exemplary business people worthy of high salaries. There is a tight, impenetrable group think that has developed over the years that has a mind of its own and the operatives have become simply incapable of taking a deep breath, standing back, and asking if everything they think they stand for does not, in fact, have a foundation of sand. This group think feels dangerous to me, where anyone who comes close to making a credible case that the emperor has no clothes will suffer the equivalent of, to varying degrees, being taken out in the dark of night and shot. <br/><br/>I think in some degree this group think mindset is related to unexamined compromises that had to be made long ago, at the beginning of boomers' careers, when they found they had to \"get with the program\" or they would not be allowed to be problem-solving, contributing members of society that could earn a credible standard of living for themselves and their families. The only way those compromises can be made is if they are buried, without a real examination of what has taken place. The result is truncated problem solving, where one can feel they are doing the right thing because it benefits their company or their family or some small part of their world but in fact often contributes to the worsening of the global condition. They give in to broad generalizations about \"free market economy\" without really thinking through how what they are participating in is really affecting the \"free market.\" Warren Buffet is a breath of fresh air but I lack the information to know if he isn't also part of the problem, ultimately. One could only hope the market crash of a few years ago would facilitate a deeper examination of this but it hasn't. In its irrationality in terms of obstructing true problem solving it has become the last, impenetrable line of defense of the corporate mindset.", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

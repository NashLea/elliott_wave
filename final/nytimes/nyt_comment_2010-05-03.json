Americans, they seem to believe, have a constitutionally guaranteed right to drive SUVs, pay far less than the real price for gas and live a heavily-subsidized suburban existence at the expense of unfortunate urban dwellers, people unable to own cars, public transit, the rest of the planet and other miscellaneous godless commies. And if some country far away inconveniently populated by brown skinned non-Christians has the nerve to be located over America's oil, then by God we will do whatever is necessary to secure it, even start wars of aggression and recklessly endanger the lives and livelihoods of all Americans - especially American soldiers - for generations.<br /><br />How has this policy worked out for ya America? the last 40 years or so? Apparently quite pretty well for some.<br /><br />There are reasons the visible pollution has diminished, one positive reason being improved technology to monitor and clean the offensive pollutants. However, along with decent middle class wage earning jobs, many of the offending industries have simply been exported to nations with lax environmental and labor laws. And putting messy environmental and labor protections into trade agreements is vorboten lest we offend the gods of free markets. Thus we have an environmental catastrophes looming in China and elsewhere. Yet another American policy that might have enormous unforeseen costs to the planet and nation. Blowback anyone?<br /><br />Indeed it does depend on leadership, the type of leadership that has been absent from the US for generations, not just in government and politics, but in every large social institution, business, religion, academia, what have you. I would love to be proven wrong, but prevailing circumstances in modern American allow an exceptionally wealthy and powerful minority to control public policy to their own benefit, the rest of humanity be damned. Until this changes, there will be more environmental disasters, perhaps in the case of human generated global warming, a catastrophe that engulfs the planet.<br /><br />On behalf of my irresponsible baby boomer generation, I'd like to sincerely apologize for the mess we bequeath to progeny.

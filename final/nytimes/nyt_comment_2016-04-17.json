Benson, 15 April post<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Benson, <br/><br/>Interesting information; thanks for sharing it with us. <br/><br/>There is a massive array of wind turbines southeast of Kingfisher, Oklahoma. I go by there now and then. <br/><br/>On Christmas Day, about 10:30a.m., I cruised by and saw that none of the turbine blades were turning.<br/><br/> Not enough wind. <br/><br/>I went by yesterday, again about 10:30 a.m. That day there was a lot of wind, probably 15-20 mph, gusting 25 perhaps. Not unusual for an April day in Oklahoma. The \"wind comes sweepin' down the plains\", as the song says, quite a bit in these parts. <br/><br/>None of the turbine blades were turning. They were feathered. <br/><br/>Too much wind. <br/><br/>So I guess wind turbines will make power but there mustn't be too much wind, and there mustn't be too little.<br/><br/>Sort of a Goldilocks technology. <br/><br/>Makes me wonder if wind power is really ready to serve as the primary motive force for an advanced industrial civilization.

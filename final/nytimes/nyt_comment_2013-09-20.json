I think Assad's use of chemical weapons was a last gambit before he had to knuckle under to international pressure.  First with getting rid of his chemical weapons and next recognizing that his efforts have ended up destroying Syria as it once was constituted.  These calls for arming the rebels are understandable but ultimately create more problems than they solve.  Now with Iran trying to end sanctions and participate in the world order where the US is the most powerful entity we see that President Obama may be on the verge of a major breakthrough.  The UN weapons inspectors, with Israel, the US and other powers tried moving the goal posts in their condemnation of Iran on issues which they could not prove and went counter to the fact that Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

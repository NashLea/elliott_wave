This is my IQ test for energy and environment experts and spokes persons.  If they understand the reason we don't want to refine tar sands (or oil sands) is that in the end, the gallon of refined fuel will generate almost twice as much carbon dioxide as conventional oil.  The process currently used is antique and water hungry and there are no good ways known to make fuel more efficiently with Tarsands.  It would be utterly stupid in terms of reducing climate change to use oil sands.  My chemical engineering colleagues say that they can pump hydrogen in the field and do better.<br/><br/>We have to move to electric transport and solar electric power generations.  We can do it.  Capturing sun power in space, converting it to microwaves, beaming to Earth, and connecting to the grid is the future.  It will take a while but it is feasible if we launch the components using Maglev in a vacuum launch tube, invented by my colleague James Powell and George Maise a great aerospace engineer/scientist.

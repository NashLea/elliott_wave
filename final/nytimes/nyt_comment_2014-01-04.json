Yield:12 bushels per acre,  right on average for all of Oklahoma that year. <br/><br/>And the land was so intensively used that buffalo, white-tailed deer, cougar, beaver, bald eagles and a long list of wildlife had basically been wiped off the face of the state. <br/><br/>One hundred years later, in 2012, Oklahoma's wheat harvest averaged 36 bushels per acre. Exactly triple what Caroline Henderson managed in 1912. <br/><br/>And 2012 was a drought year. In good years I hear reports of 50 to 56 bushels per acre. <br/><br/>And  this astonishing productivity means that much farmland can be allowed to return to nature. My family has three such parcels of fallow farmland totalling 330 acres. <br/><br/>So now the deer are back, in greater numbers even than before white settlement in 1889. The cougar are back, too, chasing the deer. The beaver are back (to my sorrow, since they are cutting down the trees on my Osage County acreage). <br/><br/>And the bald eagles are back. Last weekend  my family was thrilled to sight five bald eagles (FIVE!!!) in one tree 100 yards south of Highway 60 near Shidler, OK. <br/><br/>I should point out that the greatest threat to those eagles is now the projected wind farm planned for installation  within sight of the tree upon which those eagles were perched.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3391188, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10873884, "replies": [], "commentID": 10875252, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "HT", "createDate": "1388843560", "userID": 18463741, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1388843585", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 3, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Mika G", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Ohio", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1388843585", "commentSequence": 10875252, "commentBody": "The Laffer curve is a hill, not a monotonic slope.

Nobody knows for sure. <br/><br/>But one thing is certain: Easter Island's climate has not changed for better or worse but it  has never been forested. So the islanders who settled there could not build new ships when the ones that carried them to the island succumbed to age and ship-worm. <br/><br/>An island people who loses the  ability to make sea-going shipping becomes, in effect, prisoners on that island.

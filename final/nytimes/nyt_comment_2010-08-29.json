However, my issue is for someone who claims to be such a history buff and is always doing some historical (yet often revisionist) piece on his show, how could he not know the date's importance? Despite his selective memory he still has the right to do what he wants to do today. My issue is that he and the rest of Tea Party claim that they want to reclaim their civil rights that have been taken away by the government. Are we in the Twilight Zone?<br />Under the Patriot Act, passed by the last administration, many civil liberties can be in affect taken away when it is pleasing to the Feds. American citizens had phones tapped, internet access recorded and a host of other liberties infringed upon. Hmmmmm, where was Beck and the rest of the conservative right when this was going on? Where were they when became mired in another \"Vietnam\" over in Iraq and Afghanistan? Where were they when the Republican administration under Mr. Bush basically destroyed the balanced budget left by Mr. Clinton? Where were they when the excess and abuse of laws and the good will of the American people by the \"robber barons\" of Wall Street put not only America but the entire global economy near the point of collapse?<br /><br />Beck and other like him were on their shows talking about everything else but those issues.<br />Yet know when the present administration is trying to correct the abuses that were allowed to fester for 8 years now they suddenly want to return to ignore federal government and basically abolish many programs that help those who need help?<br /><br />The fact is Beck,Palin, and others like them will never understand the plight of most Americans. They get paid millions of dollars to show and to speak ad to spread they vitriol  and rantings. They go home richer. The rest of us still have to wake up Monday morning and wonder if we have enough money to make it through the month.<br />They can claim that the conservative right is not racist. I would really love to believe that but actions speak louder than words. Since Pres. Obama had entered the White House suddenly ( if you believe the conservative right) all is wrong in America. Yet, the fact is that things were much worse when Mr. Obama first began than now.  The fact is what happened in the economy was disastrous on an epic scale. Things were made much worse by the many thieves like Madoff who fleeced many hand working people. However, when Congress tried to put regulate the financial sector the Republicans said no. Beck and those of his ilk then claim Obama is a socialist, communist, Muslim who loves Hitler who needs to go back to Kenya. Those type of statements just show their ignorance. I am a history major and I hear those type of phrases they make my ears cringe. When it comes down to it it looks like the Republicans have a severe case of being a sore loser or they are racist or at the very least only want someone from the \"old boys\" club in the White House.<br /><br />I am not stating that everything the present administration has done is perfect but doing is better than just talking and making noise. Always voting no against bills does not help the public. Making all immigrants look un-American is distasteful. Showing all Muslims as terrorists and stirring up anti-Islamic feelings is reprehensible. Claiming that when the Republicans are back in power that they can simply repeal all the laws passed just shows a lack of common sense since repeals of federal law do not work that way.<br /><br />Beck, Palin, and the rest can all claim to be wanting the best for America. The best thing for this nation is stop fear mongering, stop saying \"no\" and bring some real ideas to the table. They need to stop with this whole \"going back to the good old days and a return to the foundation of the Constitution\". Look the Constitution was not perfect hence the amendments. They want to do away with the 13,14, and 15th amendments? Well, the day that happens is the day I leave this country ( and I am born citizen). That kind of vitriol leave a bad taste in a listener's mouth. This nation was built on the back's of immigrants. Without immigration the USA would not be what it is. Yes, immigration reform is needed but there is no need to label all immigrants as criminals.<br /><br />The conservative right is not welcoming to people who are of a different color or religion. Oh yeah they make have their \"token\" minority but the rest really only speak for the rich whites.<br />Meanwhile so many Tea Party members soak up their nonsense. Yet while they are struggling to put food on the table or to pay for health care, the Becks and Palins ( and their ilk) are fine with their large bank accounts.<br /><br />The Conservative right...in touch with the American public?

It had old-fashioned elevators that had to be run by operators.  The elevator operators added an extra layer of security for the young struggling professionals, young families and elderly people who lived in my building.

I just moved to NY in January due to the long commute from Philadelphia to college in NY, and although I may be a student, I am no stranger to living in wealthier communities. I grew up in a fairly wealthy area outside of Philadelphia, and I was for lack of better words \"spoiled\". Moving to NY was difficult for me because I didn't have a lot of money and I had to make large adjustments (i.e.- moving out of the suburbs, and carrying out many tasks that were done for me at home with my parents). I have always valued hard work, and I have worked for everything that I have now, but regardless of how much these people work and earn their \"penthouse\" apartments, this is the definition of pathetic. I am 21 years old, I live in Harlem, I'm slowly becoming accustomed to the loud atmosphere at night, but I live on my own, and I do everything for myself. It makes me angry that people would actually complain about having to take out their own trash, do you pay someone to dress you in the morning also? I understand that elderly citizens and people with disabilities may really rely on these services, but if you are living in a building where you can afford to have a doorman, I'm sure you can afford to find a caretaker or \"helper\" during the strike. I wonder what these people would do if they had to switch places with some of us that don't have the luxury of an elevator, or someone to take out their trash, or someone to clean their hallways. I hope these people realize how ridiculous they sound. MOST of the population has to do these things for themselves every day. I am grateful just to be able to live here, and have an apartment to live in and have a 20 minute subway ride to school instead of a 2 hour commute. This is the melting pot. This city is full of diversity, but this is not the kind of diversity that is good for a community. Learn to do things for yourself, and try to sound a little less stuck up and a little more capable. I think these are the people that never got the \"I walked five miles, uphill, barefoot, in the snow to school when I was your age\" speech. If I were a doorman, I'd probably go on strike for the sole fact that I would get a couple of days off from watching these people moan and groan about how hard it is to actually do something for yourself.

Unions also can help establish minimal standards for worker competencies through training and testing, as well as quality standards, worker ethics, etc.<br /><br />Yet unions also can act as bullying, intimidating and strong arming/threatening organizations when they use strikes and picket lines to block vital goods and services, especially to dependent people, like the occupants of residential housing.  Many of these people are elderly and disabled.  Many of these people are barely managing to pay their rents or maintenance payments along with their other expenses, including health care, drugs, food, utilities.  Many of these folks are the elderly, retirees, chronically unemployed, including former union members and other workers who have lost jobs in this and other recessions and industrial downsizings.<br /><br />So I come back to the issue of fairness.  I think it is fair for union workers to receive periodic cost of living increases in tune with inflation.  On the other hand, demanding increases simply because the union seeks higher wages for workers over and above inflation is not fair, especially in these challenging conditions.  It also is unfair for the union to fight to prevent improvements or corrections in shortfalls in worker productivity or competence.  Both sides should negotiate in good faith with the fairness principle in mind.  Both sides should be open to reasonable compromises.<br /><br />Residential buildings from the perspective of the residents are not businesses--they are the life support, the shelter for these people.  It is one thing for unions to press profit making businesses that have the power to increase prices to consumers or increase productivity by introducting better procedures or technologies/machines.

These workers protect you and your home, keep everything clean (so you don't have to shovel 4 feet of snow), have seen you at your best and worst, don't be surprised but know more about you than you think, helped you even if it isn't part of their job, and yet they want to take away benefits, cut pay, remove pensions, and seniority. I truely wonder if this was occuring at the jobs of these tenants where their companies decided to cut their pay,take away their benefits, their seniority, and remove their pensions all together if they would be accepting of such an idea?

I've been a doorman for 10 yrs so far. Let me explain a<br />few things. If the average salary for a doorman, porter, concierge, is<br />40,500 dollars (before taxes), and the pay out per worker for benefits<br />is $12,300 (roughly). How does that add up to $70,000? Well, I guess that's<br />why I'm a doorman, \"my math ain't so good\". Now it's not only about<br />money. We have 10 sick days, RAB wants to cut those in half. On<br />top of that, we have to pay $100 a month towards our benefits. On<br />top of that, they wanna keep maximum pay unattainable for 5 yrs for<br />new hires. And they wouldn't get a pension, or full benefits. Now<br />taking that into consideration, they would like to remove seniority<br />(considering layoffs and new hires), so that means they can layoff<br />whom ever they choose when times are \"tough\". And afterwards hire<br />someone off the street to work there, for less pay for 5 yrs. What<br />says they can't fire that kid just before he hits full pay maturity?<br />Bottom line is we want a fair deal. We aren't asking for anyones<br />blood, We just want to be able to support our families (financially<br />and health insurance wise) and be able to continue living in this<br />expensive city.

Many go to school for 4 years (college degree)and cannot even get a job offer for 35,000. A social worker studies for 6 years and only earns 35,000 at first job. A teacher in New York has to study for 6 years and beginning salary is 41,000. But a doorman needs No Education and still earns 40,500 plus tips and benefits.\"<br /><br />It is the  issue regarding the additional income that building workers earn from tips. Tip-based income may be down due to the harsh economic climate and the fact that many residents are stretched to the limit right now.  But the good news for the union members is that as the economy recovers, these tips should begin to recover as well.<br /><br />Of course, tips may vary widely from neighborhood/building and worker roles, but I suspect that in some cases this income may be substantial. There is also the issue of how much of this supplemental income is subject to taxes, as a dollar of untaxed income is worth far more than one dollar of taxable income, especially at the marginal rates when it is added on to the base salaries, and also, in dual income households, to the combined joint returns.<br /><br />I think the attacks on the residents of doorman buildings based on the delusion that people who live in doorman buildings are affluent is mean spirited and frankly dumb.  Many people who live in doorman buildings live there because the only housing available in the area for them happened to be in doorman buildings.  Many people who live in doorman buildings do so because they physically need to live in buildings with elevators because they are elderly or disabled.  Others chose to rent or buy in doorman buildings while they were in their working years and earned much more money, but now are retired and barely get along on Social Security or pensions, or whatever nest egg they were able to accumulate over time.  Many women feel the need to live in doorman buildings for reasons of safety and security.  Those who criticize the residents of doorman buildings for seeking to keep their rents and maintenance expenses under control on the grounds that these people are affluent are totally out of line.  The only issue is what is fair and appropriate on the salary, benefit and work rule area.", "recommendationCount": 38}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

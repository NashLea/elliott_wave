And this is not only in New York but everywhere. It will take more than a plan to build new \"affordable\" housing, it will take a nationwide effort on the part of administrations both at the federal and local levels to make this happen. Unaffordable housing is only a part of the demise of the middle class, and of the poor. Without having read the plan I can only suspect that it cannot possibly preserve affordable housing. I lived in New York for over 20 years and I could barely afford the rent. I did buy a house eventually but got divorced and turned the house over to my ex-spouse, a fair way to proceed. But I could never afford the rent then and certainly not now. Again, this is not happening only in New York City but everywhere. With stagnant wages, increasing demand for housing, this all spells the end for much of our way of life. I just read through the public review process and it is ridiculous. <br/><br/>\"To many in East Harlem and other parts of the city where the working class and poor scrape by, construction means disruption, which inevitably means gentrification and dislocation. The rent always goes up, but they fear that the zoning changes will only make it rise faster and higher, inevitably making them exiles from their own city.' This says a lot. Yes, the poor and the working class scrape by.

I pulled my car over and shut off an email telling them that if they are going to bring up the video which had nothing to do with what was going on in Texas then as responsible journalist they need to also say that Planned Parenthood was vindicated and the video was shown to have been heavily edited and skewed buy an antiabortion group.

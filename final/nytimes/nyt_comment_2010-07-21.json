True, perhaps the hutongs don't have modern amenities that many associate with modern living. However, I echo the sentiment of one reader that these courtyards are full of history and lifelong memories. I grew up in a hutong with my grandparents, aunt and uncle, and cousin. Though I often reluctantly shared our outhouse with spiders (and other bugs) and the kitchen was black with coal at times, there were many things in that hutong not found in modern high-rises, like the easy feeling of summer as we sat on our porches eating watermelon with our neighbors. I can still see our living room, the place of countless grandchildren's birthdays, family reunions, big dumpling dinners for Chinese New Year. I remember my grandma's \"little dark room\", so named because it occupied the place indoors directly behind our outdoor kitchen, which blocked the sun. It was where she and I took naps every afternoon while listening to Chinese comedians on the radio. There are memories in these places, and while it may seem that I'm waxing poetic, these images are what come to my mind when I think of hutongs. Bulldozing them for the malling of China seems like such a tactless, disrespectful gesture to those who lived there. How can money ever buy back memories? Perhaps the government should focus their attention on renovating these places to improve the quality of life for the residents, but keep the inherent spirit of the place alive.

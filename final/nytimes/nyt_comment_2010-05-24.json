The so-called \"populist\" events are often funded by Republican front groups. For some reason, none of these front groups seems to have funded any pitchforks-to-Wall-Street events. None has funded \"Save Our Shores\" bus trips to the Louisiana wetlands. What they have funded instead are ANTI-POPULIST issues -- principally the oppo to health care, laced with \"We Want Our Country Back\" & \"No New Taxes\" slogans. That would be, take our country back to the genteel days of the Old South, & no new taxes for rich people. A poll of Tea Partiers found that the majority believed Obama & the Democratic Congress had raised taxes when in fact they had lowered them for most Americans. These foolish Tea Partiers remain dupes of the cynical Republican machine, a machine that has found new gears to turn Beltway protests.<br /><br />The most obvious new gear runs the \"fear of a foreign-born socialist black president\" meme. But that's not working too well with the slightly rational or with the younger wingers. So one of the most clever ways Rove, Armey et al. have tapped into the \"small government\" mantra is to oppose regulation of any kind. There's a reason the NRA gets its way that has nothing to do with guns -- Republicans have linked gun control (2nd Amendment) to regulation of any kind. The liberal elites are going to take away your guns & as proof, they're already pushing through regulations to curb our capitalist economy. The opposition to health care follows the same script: the Democrats are infringing on states' rights (10th Amendment), they're forcing you to get health insurance even if you're healthy AND they're telling \"small\" businesses they have to provide coverage.<br /><br />As for the deficit (ruining the lives of the grandkids), that suddenly became all the Democrats' fault, too. So did those \"government handouts\" to GM & Chrysler, etc. Buying into clever Republican talking points about pandering to unions, Tea Partiers give Democrats no credit for saving a major American industry. What happened to \"Buy America\"?<br /><br />All this and more. Yet weirdly, weirdly, no mention of the Patriot Act, which really DOES infringe on personal privacy. No mention of new restrictions on habeas corpus. No mention of Citizens United v. FEC.<br /><br />No use crying about it, Democrats & other rational people. We need to find our own talking points, points that tell the truth. We've been a little smug, we've forced the President -- that suspicious socialist foreigner -- to do our jobs for us. Hey, we've got pitchforks, too. (I use mine to turn the mulch for my garden.) Let's get 'em out, shine 'em up & sharpen the tines.

The idea that a corporation is a person was a useful and probably necessary legal fiction that allows, among other things that corporations can be sued in civil courts.

It is important for our good journalists to allow their anger to spill over into their careful reporting to give impetus for possible change.<br /><br />When President Obama was campaigning for the presidency, some of we liberal -progressives were puzzled by your lukewarm, even occasional put downs of his rhetoric and exciting plans for the future. I wonder if you saw his weaknesses at the time and could predict the failures of productive action to come. It is obvious that the structure of our political parties along with the ties to corporate power by the right wingers of our nation has not changed over the decades, but has grown more stubborn and dangerous with time and opportunity.<br /><br />Our President is unhealthily involved  with the financial and political power structure of our nation and too frightened to move strongly in other directions during a time of extreme crisis in many areas of our nation's business.<br /><br />I am tired of hearing from many progressive and liberal friends that Obama can't do much  with what he was handed to deal with from the past.  But he could do SOMETHING and when he did have choices, he took the wrong turn in the road. A perfect example is his decision to escalate our presence in Afghanistan despite opposition from a majority of Americans. I could cite many other opportunities for bold action to move out of the present morass, which were sidestepped.<br /><br />I for one, will not vote for him for a second term, although in November  will absentee vote for the lawmakers who tried to move our nation forward, of whom there are precious few.  If the Republicans and right wing Independents win, so be it.  I refuse to support members of my Democratic party who have betrayed the promises made more than a year ago and been mostly silent on issues of vital importance. We can do better, but it may have to get worse before reality strikes and all the options for hope disappear.<br /><br />Thank you for your column - we all need more belly fire and anger to incite civil action.<br />", "recommendationCount": 162}, {"assetID": 1487816, "replies": [], "lft": 44, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/opinion/24krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2025244, "rgt": 45, "userDisplayName": "JG", "createDate": "1274671924", "userID": 55610270, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1274674234", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Caesarea", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1274721025", "commentSequence": 21, "commentBody": "According to Krugman, \"Roosevelt turned corporate opposition into a badge of honor: 'I welcome their hatred,' he declared.

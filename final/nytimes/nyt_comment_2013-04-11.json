Based on these knowledge, we can then deduce how neurons, neuronal ensembles, and neural networks interact to produce certain types of brain function. But would that be enough to make us understand the physiological processes underlying sensory perception, memory, emotions, cognition, and other complex neural processes? I certainly doubt it. As a matter of fact, we already know a lot- not everything, but a lot - about neural architectonics and connectivity. We actually have many tools at our disposal for \"imaging\" the distribution of specific molecules such as transmitter receptors. For example, receptors can be targeted using ultraspecific monocloclonal antibodies or radiotracers and \"imaged\" using PET, optical imaging, etc. These \"in-vivo\" techniques are definitely more superior for studying brain function compared to the clarity method which can only be applied to dead brains.

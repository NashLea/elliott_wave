Thank you for your reply. I will answer both questions.<br/><br/>Wheeler - The reason why it is difficult to contact people via cell phones is The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) (47 U.S.C. 227 , 47 CFR 64.1200) prohibits the use of an \u201cautomatic telephone dialing system\u201d to contact \u201cany telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service\u201d without \u201cexpress prior consent\u201d from the party being called. Based upon this federal law, the only way you can legally poll someone with a cell phone is if they have provided prior consent via the Do Not Call registry system. It is widely estimated that less than 30% of Americans with cell phones only have given their consent to be contacted for polling and other solicitations via their cell phones. Consent is not granted when one opens a cell phone account. The owner has to initiate the consent. <br/><br/>Froggy - We use extensive election statistical that is complied by municipal and county clerks. the Qualified voter file contains demographic stats on each registered voter. We work with the clerks to compile their individual statistics over a number of elections that fit our model profile. For the Michigan 2012 general election, we are using 15 elections in our model. Using the 2008 exit polls to project the 2012 electoral universe is extremely limited for construct a detailed model for state turnout. In Michigan, African American seniors ages 66 and older and middle aged voters get missed in exit polling samples.

Surely a philosopher who has considered Mormonism couldn't have missed the female component of God, Heavenly Mother. Women in Mormonism are indeed priests, or priestesses, and God cannot be God without Goddess. Divinity is not masculine (or feminine), but absolutely and explicitly both.

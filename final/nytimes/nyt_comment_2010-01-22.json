He's only offering up another publicity stunt (remember \"mortgage refinancing,\"  \"consumer finance regulation\")  in order to \"act\" like he's really reforming Wall Street.

No Mr. Smiths will get to Washington as long as this law stands because they won't have the money to prevail against corporate-funded candidates. As for Congress, it's already done for. Since neither party has or is likely to get a supermajority of 60 votes, nothing good for us will pass the senate again because all one party has to do is stonewall to prevent the other party from claiming success at something. It would take 67 senate votes to change this evil senate rule concerning filibuster and cloture. What's the likelihood of that, now? Zero.

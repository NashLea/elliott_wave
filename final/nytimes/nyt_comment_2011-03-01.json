Of course you have memories when you are long in the tooth.  Is it the theme?  My Dad always drank tea and never coffee.  Is it RABBIT EARS because those were the only antennas for the early TVs?  Is it the LEM because I remember what I was doing when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon?  Is it those DELIS in Shaker Heights where my wife would order a Reuben?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />It\u2019s the Greyhound BUS.  When many kids would go off to camp for the summer, I would travel to Paducah to stay with my grandmothers, aunts and uncles and cousins for most of the summer.  I actually had a group of kids who were my summer playmates in Paducah.  As a kid I traveled to Paducah and back to Chicago on the Greyhound BUS.  Those were the days before air conditioning.  The ride was long, by way of US 45, not Interstate 57.  The ride from Chicago to Paducah was 400 miles, with almost nothing but cornfields to watch out the window.  The time was invariably 8 long, boring, hot hours.  I used to imagine that the driver was driving around the same cornfield for 8 hours band then we were magically there.<br /><br />It was also a time of segregation, with separate restrooms in the bus station.  Once, on the way to Paducah, the bus stopped at the old Irvin S. Cobb Bridge that crossed the Ohio River so that African-Americans would go to the rear, as required by Kentucky law.

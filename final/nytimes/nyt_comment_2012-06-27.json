Imagine for a moment a person at the bottom of a deep squat, with their feet flat. Now imagine them moving up onto their toes; what happens to their knee and hip angle? <br/><br/>You may have to do this yourself to see it.  What will happen is that the knee angle will shorten, and then the hip angle will open. This roughly corresponds to increased use of the quads, and decreased use of the ham strings and glutes, and more stretch on the connective tissues of the knee. The fact that the hamstrings are shortened in this position can also lead to a net anterior shear on the knee, as the quad pulls the tibia forward.  If the feet are flat, forces are more evenly distributed between the knee and hip joint.<br/><br/>So, since we (presumably) want to train our ham strings and glutes, and do not want to injure our knees, having one's heals on the ground is probably a good idea. Also, add the fact that you are just more stable with feet flat on the ground, and you probably want to be stable when you have a big heavy thing on your shoulders.<br/><br/>Now, there are lots of other activities where you do want to be on your toes. And if we are talking about unweighted squats, it is probably fine to be on your toes since the forces involved are not so high.

Take it for what it's worth, which is a very great deal. ;)<br/><br/>********<br/>\nIt's good that people are discovering the superb virtues of basic barbell moves like the squat and deadlift, but this has led to an epidemic of bad form.  If there is any single thing I would advise the beginning lifter, or the strong young buck who thinks he's anything else, it's this:<br/><br/>When you squat or deadlift, remember that *both* of these movements target the massive musculature of the lower body, esp. your hamstrings and your glutes.  Knowing this, make sure as you do these movements to keep your spine straight with a slight arch at the base of the back; and always *think of your heels* as you squat or deadlift.  <br/><br/>Thinking of your heels when you squat will help prevent you from coming forward and putting immense pressure on your knees; the same thing is true when you pull a deadlift -- you should always be thinking about driving your heels into the ground.<br/><br/>Never rush these exercises; never \"explode\" up.  Just move at a comfortable place, allowing your hamstrings, glutes and quads to engage and lift the weight.  Remember: you do not pull a deadlift up with your arms -- your arms are simply attached to the barbell.  <br/><br/>When I say \"think of your heels,\" I mean exactly that: think about your heels as you squat and deadlift.  That trains your brain and locks in your form.<br/><br/>See next post for more advice.

This is a *severely underrated* exercise which can have *seemingly miraculous* positive effects for those with chronic lower-back pain and lumbar disc issues.  <br/><br/>Start slowly and learn the correct form: do not place your hands behind your neck; do not cross your arms in from of your chest.  Simply allow your arms to hang down freely.  Slowly, thinking at all times about the muscles in your lower-back, raise yourself to a comfortable height; then allow your body to go all the way down, essentially folding in half.  Slowly raise again.  As you grow stronger you will find yourself extending your range of motion quite a bit; once this occurs, consider adding weight.  You will hold this weight with your arms extended and your elbows locked.  Remember: the muscles of your lower-back are lifting the weight, whether it's the weight of your body or your body plus additional weight.  Always think of the lower-back as you do these.  It's an enormously useful exercise, and inexplicably neglected. <br/><br/>Finally. Learn how to do a full pullup.  If you can't do one, do machine-assisted pullups until you're able to execute one perfect, high pullup.  Ideally use a straight-bar, with your palms facing away from you, a little more than shoulder width.  Do not yank yourself up; think about your the large muscles of your back, your lats, and pull up at an even pace, as high as you can.

Because both decisions overruled validly passed campaign finance laws that were designed to protect our democracy from turning into an open system of bribery. <br/><br/>Does that mean you will object if the Court overturns health care reform? As two leading conservative judges, Jeffrey Sutton and Laurence Silberman, both found in upholding health care reform, the shared responsibility (\"individual mandate\") provision that is the focus of attacks on health care reform easily fits within nearly 80 years of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, that today's Court would have to wipe out to invalidate the legislatively enacted health care reform. <br/><br/>The simple reality is that both sides engage in judicial activism. The difference is that progressive justices do so to protect our civil liberties and equality, while conservatives do so in order to further the interests of corporate interests and conservative politicians. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 476}, {"assetID": 3327349, "replies": [], "lft": 173, "assetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/combating-acid-reflux-may-bring-host-of-ills/", "parentID": 6501876, "commentID": 6502224, "rgt": 174, "userDisplayName": "molly", "createDate": "1340750944", "userID": 44395940, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1340770425", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "san diego", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1340766825", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Nope.

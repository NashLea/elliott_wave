Any nation can apply that analysis to determine whether a program of austerity is viable and, if so, the time and costs involved.  And so it is not just Greece but Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, or any nation that accepted a bailout program which can apply Krugman's textbook analysis to evaluate its austerity program and determine whether the euro is worth it.  <br/><br/>And they shall, with the result that the Eurozone will face calls, which have already begun, to renegotiate their respective austerity programs.

It is astounding that 43% of black children live below the poverty line in this country, and I'm sure that the percentage of white and Hispanic children is no less acceptable. And I'd bet that the percentage of Native American children is worse.  <br/><br/>The phenomenon of so many children living in poverty is not only a moral outrage and tragedy, it's the seed of greater societal problems in the future. Can our leaders not see that assisting these children through their growth to adulthood and productive, positive citizenship will be less of a burden than not assisting them?  <br/><br/>And, in addition, there needs to be a greater focus on job production for these children, and everyone. The actions of our Congress have been counter to job production, with government spending at a record low as a percentage of GDP, the inadequate stimulus, the sequester, the shutdown, etc. All of these have been solid blows to economic growth and job production, and all of them sacrificial offerings to the gods of austerity and class warfare. <br/><br/>Am I wrong in fearing that there's a subconscious, at least, motive of repression in failing to address these human needs properly?"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10582182, "replies": [], "commentID": 10583402, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Carol Benedict Russell", "createDate": "1385123418", "userID": 64375336, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1385144927", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Bill Benton", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Shelter Island, New York", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1385144927", "commentSequence": 10583402, "commentBody": "You should promote the 'six/sixty plan'.....and say emphatically why...<br/>such a plan would benefit the entire nation.<br/><br/>A stimulus is thereby given to USA ...because<br/><br/>Healthy people who are nourished ; healthy children: healthy seniors ...<br/>actually will grow our nation to prosperity.<br/><br/>Stumbling blocks of under supported children and seniors only cripple<br/>our nation...and I cannot see why the short sighted do not understand this."}]}, "lft": 206, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/opinion/krugman-expanding-social-security.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 10582182, "rgt": 211, "userDisplayName": "Bill Benton", "createDate": "1385096740", "userID": 27988722, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1385096765", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "San Francisco", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1385096765", "commentSequence": 10582182, "commentBody": "We should be doing everything we can to help children up to the age of six, and seniors over sixty.

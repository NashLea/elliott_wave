I have been involved in various efforts to respond to dire situations both here and in other parts of the world, starting with Hurricane Huge in 1989 and continuing with the civil war  in Somalia in the '90s, etc. (All very modest efforts.) The biggest problem is that the response is always too slow. It takes too long to wake up the world to a problem, get the needed goods and personnel into the affected area and to make a significant difference. All too frequently, when the most could be accomplished, resources are lacking.<br/><br/>This is the case now, by all appearances, with Ebola in west Africa. It has taken far too long for the wealthy world to wake up to the seriousness of the problem in the deprived world. Once awakened, it has taken too long to respond. Those individual or small groups that have responded, like those who sent two container loads of medical supplies to Liberia have been met with official resistance from the local govt., blocking the supplies at the shipping terminal, according to reports. <br/><br/>Where is leadership? Where is someone with the authority and the audacity to get things done? After the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, people were having limbs removed with ordinary home saws, yet across the water in Jamaica, there were surgical supplies that went nowhere.

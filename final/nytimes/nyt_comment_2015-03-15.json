The industry receives massive govt subsidies in the form of corn subsidies, grazing permits (on public land!), etc., so it's economically unsustainable.

The crowds were already in the stadium, and minutes later they were informed Venus pulled out due to injury.  There were rumors that the sisters father orchestrated this, so that the sisters wouldn't have to play one another; a rumor exarcerbated by magazine rumors, and other jealous tennis players.  The crowd was mightily unhappy.<br/><br/>The next day, Serena is into the finals with Kim Clijsters. When she, Venus, and father entered the stadium, they were booed viciously. The boo continued throughout the match for hours; with the crowds cheering for Serena's errors, her double faults, and booing her when she won the match. Her Father claimed racial epithets were thrown against him; some say unfounded, but Billie Jean King and other attendants confirmed this indeed happened.<br/><br/>Serena and Venus then boycotted the tournament since that day in 2001.  This tournament is not a small one. This is the largest tournament besides the 4 Grandslams, often called the 5th Grand Slam, a mandatory event.  The sisters continued to boycott, also bcs of fear of returning. Serena was also 19 at that time, as a teenager at the beginning of her career, couldn't understand why this happened.<br/><br/>14 years, 18 grand slam wins later, and at the twilight of her career, Serena, at age 34, decided she wanted to rewrite this horrible chapter by returning to Indian wells, forgiving the tournament, and let go all of her feelings and move on.

If we wanted to reimpose segregation in parts of the country, we could do it and it would be ugly, sort of like what the Nazis did to Germany.  <br/><br/>Imposing traditional morality would take the same sort of effort.  Decent people would not let their kids associate with illegitimate children, and women who became pregnant outside of wedlock would be objects of scorn and experience job discrimination.  Young women who did not protect their virginity by avoiding parties or going out after dark alone or dressing modestly would be blamed for anything that happened.  Those who did not reinforce the right moral lessons would find themselves in trouble.  Group pressure would once more stifle individual freedom.<br/><br/>If sermons could restore traditional morality, it would have happened already.

I do not believe most people really care about it or they have never considered it. These animals feel pain exactly the same way that you and I do. I buy beef and chicken at Whole Foods because they claim that the animals are raised and slaughtered humanely, but I don't know for sure. It may be hypocritical, but I believe a quick, painless death for an animal is ethical way to get protein. In terms of evolution, humans could not have grown the brains we have if we did not consume animal protein - the brain just uses too much energy. Nowadays of course, there are alternatives and it is much easier to obtain food.", "recommendationCount": 19}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

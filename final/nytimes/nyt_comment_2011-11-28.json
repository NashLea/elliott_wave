In fact, we had just left the War Museum and were heading across the street towards the bus station to look over schedules, when the man, perhaps 50 yards away from us, began shooting. We ran off into a nearby shopping mall and observed the proceedings from there as the local police shot the man, who never sought cover, in the legs. I think for us, and virtually everyone there, the incident was surreal, and wholly unrelated to the pleasure of visiting Bosnia in general. The comparison of Sarajevo to NYC seems appropriate; we encountered nothing but sincere warmth on the part of everyone we met. We thoroughly enjoyed Croatia as well, but Sarajevo and Mostar occupy particularly special places in our hearts. We hope to return very soon.

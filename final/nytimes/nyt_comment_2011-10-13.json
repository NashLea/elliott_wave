As the wife and caregiver of an ALS patient, and the daughter-in-law of woman who has had Parkinson's for 10 years (his mother,) I am living the ravages of serious terminal illness all around me.  Although you might not agree, I would rather my husband had Parkinson's.  At least we'd have had more time to eat a meal together, have a conversation that isn't with a letter board, or still be invited to a friend's house that doesn't have a wheelchair access.  <br/><br/>And before you knock this doctor, who was raising money for Parkinson's research when he observed this effect, you should be thankful that he took his observations to the lab.  There are clues in these quirks about the disease process.  Something a pharmaceutical company would never \"happen upon\".  Because it belongs in the category of Basic Research, which also helps all diseases universally.  Unfortunately the handful of saintly neurologists who \"see\" (there is no treatment) ALS patients have so little time to offer their patients mostly because ALS patients go broke and have to use Medicaid and the hospital MBAs don't want them to waste their time on poor patients, that what the neurologist/clinicians can report to the poorly funded ALS researchers is minimal.<br/><br/>Yes, we are a first world nation, but I think with a terminal illness like ALS or Parkinson's we might as well be Greece.  It's down to hoping the saints will want to dedicate their education, experience,intellectual curiosity and time to helping us.

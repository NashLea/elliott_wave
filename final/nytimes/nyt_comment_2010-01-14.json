In addition to the Physical Fitness Test, consisting of the traditional pullups, crunches, and a 3 mile timed run, the Combat Fitness Test was recently introduced as a way to measure the fitness of Marines in a combat like scenario. A 880 yard sprint in boots is followed by 30-35 lb ammo can lifts and ending in a \"maneuver under fire\" where the individual Marine is forced to sprint, crawl, pickup up a wounded comrade and carry him or her a certain distance and still be expected to have the strength to carry two ammo cans to the end of the course and back. The PFT and CFT scores are factored in evaluations and promotions and those not seen as up to par are quickly dealt with. Physical appearance is also seen as important to the image the Marine Corps. Those Marines that do not meet the height/weight standards or consistently under-perform physically, are assigned to the Body Composition Program and Military Appearance Program. The BCP was designed to get Marines back to an acceptable physical fitness level and appearance or separate them from the Corps. Commanders have the authority to assign Marines to the program even if they meet the height/weight standards if they simply look out of shape. So do I think Marines are more out of shape now than they were in the past? No. Careful oversight by unit commanders and solid guidance from the Commandant on issues of appearance and fitness ensures that the vast majority of the Marine Corps remains more than capable of both joining the fight and looking sharp in a set of Dress Blues.

I remember a staff NCO who did duty with the Royal Marines, and he said that they ran him into the ground as he developed knee problems. Friends who were in Reconnaissance said that they were humping fools, as did a neighbor who was in the Special Forces. They're a much smaller force so they can have more stringent training requirements.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines</a><br /><br />....The Royal Marines have one of the longest basic infantry training courses in the world..... all Royal Marines, except those in the Royal Marines Band Service, complete the Commando course as part of their training (see below). Key aspects of the course include climbing and ropework techniques, patrolling, and amphibious warfare operations.<br /><br />This intense phase ends with a series of tests which have remained virtually unchanged since World War II. Again, these tests are done in full fighting order of 32 lb (14.5 kg) of equipment.<br /><br />The Commando Tests are taken on consecutive days and all four tests must be successfully completed within a seven day period; they include;<br /><br />A nine mile (14.5 km) speed march, carrying full fighting order, to be completed in 90 minutes; the pace is thus 10 minutes per mile (6 min/km or 6 mph).<br /><br />The Endurance course is a six mile (9.65 km) course across rough moorland and woodland terrain at Woodbury Common near Lympstone, which includes tunnels, pipes, wading pools, and an underwater culvert. The course ends with a four mile (6 km) run back to CTCRM. Followed by a marksmanship test, where the recruit must hit 6 out of 10 shots at a 25m target simulating 200 m. To be completed in 73 minutes (71 minutes for Royal Marine officers). Originally 72 minutes, these times were recently increased by one minute as the route of the course was altered.<br /><br />The Tarzan Assault Course. This is an assault course combined with an aerial confidence test. It starts with a death slide (now known as The Commando Slide) and ends with a rope climb up a thirty foot near-vertical wall. It must be completed with full fighting order in 13 minutes, 12 minutes for officers. The Potential Officers Course also includes confidence tests from the Tarzan Assault Course, although not with equipment.<br /><br />The 30 miler. This is a 30 mile (48 km) march across upland Dartmoor, wearing full fighting order, and additional safety equipment carried by the recruit in a daysack. It must be completed in eight hours for recruits and seven hours for Royal Marine officers, who must also navigate the route themselves, rather than following a DS (a trained Royal Marine) with the rest of a syndicate and carry their own equipment.<br /><br />....Completing the Commando course successfully entitles the recruit or officer to wear the coveted green beret but does not mean that the Royal Marine has finished his training. That decision will be made by the troop or batch training team and will depend on the recruit's or young officer's overall performance. Furthermore, officer training still consists of many more months.<br /><br />Training to be a Royal Marine takes 32 weeks. The last week is spent mainly on administration and preparing for the pass out parade. Recruits in their final week of training are known as the King's Squad and have their own section of the recruits' galley at Lympstone.<br />", "recommendationCount": 2}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

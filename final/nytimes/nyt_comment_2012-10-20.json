The northern opposition to slavery was often the only difference separating their views, and most northerners who opposed slavery did not do so for humanitarian reasons, or at least not primarily.  The Free Soil movement of the Western territories (a precursor to the Republican party), for example, grew out of a desire to keep slavery out of them because, in slave states, slaveowners (roughly 5% of the population) held the lion's share of the power.

Although the author of this article is quite correct that many praised the black troops' bravery, for some there was an element of condescension in their praise, rather like a chauvinist complementing a woman as being \"brave, for a woman.\"  Support for black inclusion often came from the simple desire for blacks to provide their share of the effort in this war that increasingly came to be against slavery.

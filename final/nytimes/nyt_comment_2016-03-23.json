So I telephoned the major paper. I asked the person on the other end whether she would be able to transmit info to the editor.

Some ovens have a proofing mode, where the temperature is around 80 degrees.  You can also build a proofing box by using a low wattage light bulb with a dimmer switch and thermometer in a styrofoam container, and trying to proof at higher temperatures- experiment from 75-90 degrees.  When I made my own local sourdough starter in Brazil the temperature was probably in the 80s or higher which is one reason it did so well.  A room temperature of 68 or even 72 is too low to really get cultures fully activated.  When you activate your culture you should see it rise \"exponentially\" as it rises and bubbles up and peaks then starts shrinking down as it starts to run out of the sugar needed for growing with the shortest doubling time."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 17975637, "replies": [], "commentID": 18142103, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "JanCBell", "createDate": "1460056302", "userID": 49644353, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1460056327", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "truthyone", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Santa Barbara", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1460052727", "commentSequence": 18142103, "commentBody": "I was wondering if that guy was still around (at Sourdoughs International)! <br/><br/>I bought, via mail order in the late '80s, three of the packaged starters as offered by Sourdoughs International.

This is a sourdough which is not very sour.

One thing I learned from him is that activating your culture before you use it gives the best results- so take a cup out of your mother culture from the refrigerator, add a cup of flour and a half cup of spring or distilled (NOT city tap water), mix it and let it rise at room temperature (or a little higher if possible - 75-80 degrees) until it rises and froths (and it may overflow your bowl)- at that point the culture is maximally active, and if you use it to make dough it will cause it to rise very briskly and make great bread.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 3449378, "replies": [], "lft": 80, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/travel/oregon-standoff-bird-watching.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 17975538, "rgt": 81, "userDisplayName": "Andrew Ralph Block", "createDate": "1458705380", "userID": 64502587, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1458707052", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Oakland, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1458703452", "commentSequence": 17975538, "commentBody": "Find the Malheur near you!

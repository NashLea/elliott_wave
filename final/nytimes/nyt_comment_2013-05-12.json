They are sighted regularly off the coast of Kauai because it is closest (other than Niihau) to the largest population.

Also, NW pups are consistently weaned underweight because their mothers can't put on enough fat to nurse them long enough to allow them to survive their weaning and learning period.  Monk seals nurse young for only a maximum of 7 weeks, far less than that in the NW, and they get no training from their mother in how to hunt or what to hunt.  They have to figure all that out on their own while living off their nursing fat gained after birth.<br/><br/>Add to that the competition from other predators for the pups and very few make it to adulthood.

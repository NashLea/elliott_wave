Appreciate the note.<br/><br/>The goodwill factor does get overlooked sometimes, I think because it's less quantifiable. But as someone who has traveled and lived abroad for a good number of years, I can attest (at least anecdotally) that American goodwill still very much exists.  For all the angry protests over Koran burnings, the detentions of aid workers and the occasional attacks on McDonald's and KFC franchises, the United States is widely admired. This is purely my personal impression after having traveled to 102 countries. <br/><br/>One quick example: I lived in Hanoi, Vietnam, for four years and traveled the country top to bottom. Even in areas that were devastated during the war I never encountered a single episode of hatred or animosity. Quite the opposite: I was welcomed with an astounding level of goodwill and hospitality, whether in gleaming offices, cement-block houses or bamboo shacks. The Vietnamese, even former Viet Cong fighters and people who were deeply affected by the war, notably from Agent Orange, have moved on. I never heard a harsh word or had an uneasy moment. <br/><br/>Sorry for the digression, but it's my personal belief that a little goodwill and a certain amount of soft power still go a long way overseas. Sacks of wheat in a drought in Chad, cans of cooking oil in Armenia, deliveries of cement in post-tsunami Aceh, pup tents and jugs of clean water after a hurricane in Burma --- despite America's current economic challenges, we can still well afford this stuff.

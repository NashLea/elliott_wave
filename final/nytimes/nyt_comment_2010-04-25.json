I too am heartbroken about the demise of the Tibetan nomad culture and the Tibetan culture in general.  I have witnessed the same horrible predicament facing what i consider to be the most spiritual culture on earth.  I also travel regularly through the Amdo and Kham regions helping to rebuild monasteries and medical clinics.  Similarly I am brought to tears every year because of the Chinese constructed fences - effectively killing the nomad lifestyle, because of the forced migration of vast numbers of innocent, harmless nomad families into cramped, stacked government housing, and because the children are being forced into Chinese schools and forced to speak only Chinese.  There are many more reasons to mourn the death of a culture that overall represents the highest spiritual standards on our planet.  It is a very deliberate, calculated effort by the Chinese government to destroy the Tibetan culture as quickly as possible.  We should be ashamed if we don't do something about it.  We should be ashamed for NOT going there.<br />So for me... anyone who has the tenacity, the guts to go there because it is not an easy journey on many levels... to actually go there and expose this, to document the last of a rare and beautiful culture is quite admirable.  It is very easy to criticize, to have an opinion, but who actually does good things for the world?  How many of us dare to bring this or other fiascos to evidence?<br />Thankfully the Tibetan language and culture is being preserved in India, Bhutan, Nepal and even here in the U.S., although the Chinese government is now applying much pressure on the Nepalese government to expel and marginalize the culture there.  The Tibetan nomad culture in Tibet is however on its deathbed.<br />Thank you very much Alison for your incredible photos.  Your compassionate nature is evident in your work.

My argument is with Pakistani culture itself<br />wherein the dead body of a beautiful animal is a suitable gift. It is an appropriate allegory for the country itself and the peculiarities of  arranged marriage. On the other hand a fur coat would be equally heinous.

We all knew what was going too happen from the Option ARM and 1 and 2 year fixed loans. It's simple math. Let's say someone wanted to refinance and couldn't afford the payment for an adjustable mortgage amortized for 30 years (full amount amount divided over 30 years), the loan would be amortized for 45 or 50 years but at a fixed rate for 1 or 2. That was just the beginning, when all of the banks and brokers in our industry started to see how bad the monthly adjustable Option ARMs (negative amortization loans) were, they created the fixed rate Option ARM. This was where the fully indexed rate was locked for three or five years. We were also given incentives for giving higher fully indexed rates. If you were could qualify for an Option ARM at 7% and I gave one to you at 8%, I was given what it called rebate from the bank. Rebate is a certain small percentage of the loan. It works like this. Your loan is $400,000. Your par rate (which means the rate which is best for you at minimal cost to you and no money to me) is 7%. If we gave you an Option ARM at 7.5% we would get from the bank 1.5% of your loan in rebate from the bank. So we would get $6,000 from the bank for giving you a higher fully indexed rate. If we gave you 8%, we would get 3% or sometimes more from the bank in rebate. The rebate was bigger if you were given a \"hard prepayment penalty\". A hard prepay is where if you refinance or sell your house within 1-3 years, you had to pay usually a large penalty fine. Banks and investors like those loans because this prevented you from refinancing because you were scared of this penalty. The investor bought the loans because of the high fully indexed rates you paid and that's why they gave us rebate, because what they paid out was minimal to what they would get. These loans would get sold off to other investors and that how some banks appeared \"clean\". They would set up the loan and give it to you and then sell it off to a servicing company like Litton. This rebate allowed us to cover any hits that the bank would charge which would normally increase your rate (i.e. you have a second home, you had stated income because income could not be proven or lived in a condo or conversion). But if you had no \"hits\" as they are called, We would make $12,000 from the bank which you did not pay and then we would charge you 1-2% for origination fee or even less if competing against other brokers. They also did the last minute switch which confused people. They would tell you that your rate was 5% so if other people called, no one could \"beat the rate\", then when it came close to signing your loan documents, your rate magically changed. They did this a lot or would tell you your loan was already being processed when you only signed the disclosures(which are basic documents that do not obligate you to work with a broker or bank anyway and just outlines your loan and the cost) and those disclosures are just sitting on a desk for a week or two. So someone like me could call with an actual lower rate and you would think you were locked into a loan already. A lot of the banks did this too, Ditech, Bank of America, Washington Mutual, IndyMac, MIT, Countrywide etc.... The banks you already had accounts with would give you a specific interest rate but had different penalties or fees and appeared cheaper than others. All they did was wrap up the fees in the rebate and made money off the higher rates. The 5 year fixed rate Option ARMs were still being offered in 2007 and 2008. It is far from over because as the fixed rates expire, the interest rates with adjust rapidly. Bear Stearns did a lot of these subprime loans and purchased companies that did these loans. It was inevitable that Bear Stearns would fail. Countrywide would have probably created an economic collapse if it was not purchased by Bank of America.

The US had one in 1986 when they naturalized about 3 million illegals, now they have a problem with over 11 million illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>If the US allows legislation like the dream act how many illegal immigrants will they have to deal with in 2050, 50 million?<br/><br/>This is not out of the question.  Anybody who knows what is happening in the rest of the world knows that with the worlds population approaching about 9 Billion by 2030, up from 7 Billion people today, the pressure to immigrate to a developed country, from the developing world is going to increase dramatically.  The approximate 2 Billion people are all going to be added in the developing world.  With the increasing mobility of people and also the dramatic rise of automation and robotics that is massively reducing the demand for unskilled/low skilled workers no country is going to want the expensive burden of these people, people who aren't their citizens.  <br/><br/>It is now the developed world who is starting to take a strong stance against illegal immigrants, but some countries in the developing world are also working out that if they want to improve the lives of their people they also need to control their immigration.  Why would a country do all the hard work of going through the demographic transition, of reducing its birth rates so it can improve their citizens lives, only to be swamped by people from other countries who are not taking the tough decisions to limit population growth and force themselves through the demographic transition.

I can only imagine that immigrants who entered this country legally and spent years wading through bureaucratic red tape (not to mention tens of thousands of dollars) to gain legal citizenship must feel like fools.  They could have saved a lot of time and money if only they had entered the country illegally!<br/><br/>As a former resident of New York State, I am baffled by the decision to extend financial aid to illegal immigrants.  The community in which I used to live had a hospital that was on the verge of bankruptcy in part (probably large part) due to illegals using the ER as their primary care physician and never paying the bill.  It had one school district in dire financial straits due to illegals having three families living in a single family home so that the property taxes did not cover the extra children going to school.  Not to mention the bilingual teachers the schools had to hire and the translators that the courts had to employ, due to the large non-English speaking population.  The voting ballot was even translated into Spanish!<br/><br/>In an age when states cannot afford to pay for social services for their LEGAL citizens, it is nothing more than insanity to spend state resources (which are coming from where?) to further assist and enable those living in this country illegally.

Some of the incentives now: free k-12 education, in Spanish at many schools. Free or reduced price school lunches and breakfasts. Menial jobs, but still at a higher pay than in the country of origin. In state tuition at a state school, and now financial aid because even in state tuition is too high.  Why wouldn't someone come here illegally?<br/><br/>Why should illegal immigrants (they are not \"children of illegals\". Unless they were born in the US, they are illegal) have access to state run colleges? Have we reached the point where every legal NY citizen can easily afford college?  How about this?  In May of each year, after colleges have received replies from all students that they have offered admission to, they will determine if there is space available. If there is space available, let illegal immigrants apply and pay international student rates. If there are excess funds available after all citizen students have had their demonstrated financial need met, then let the illegal students use that too. Anything else is a slap in the face to the many NY families who are struggling to pay tuition or did not get into the state school of their choice.

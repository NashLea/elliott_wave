And another three cheers for taking responsibility for your own willingness to have let the religious hierarchy of your church off the hook.<br /><br />The New Testament does have a few strong women characters -- Mary Magdalene, Martha &amp; Mary -- the sisters of Lazarus -- &amp; most importantly, Mark's Syrophoenician woman who taught Jesus not to be such a bigot. Moreover, Luke &amp; John especially base aspects of Jesus himself on the wisdom goddess Sophia. John says the Holy Spirit is feminine. But the Roman church decided early on to create the cult of Mary, the mother of Jesus -- not the strong Mary who ordered folks around at the wedding at Cana or the gutsy Mary who showed up at the crucifixion when all the male disciples fled -- but the humble Mary of the birth stories whose main purpose was to serve as a vessel for the Lord. The Cult of the Virgin is part &amp; parcel of the insidious but effective plot to diminish women's strengths &amp; their sexuality.<br /><br />Men in skirts, afraid &amp; ashamed of their own sexuality, just can't deal with the parishioners who make up well more than half of their supporters. Those supporters, from the brides of Christ to the once-a-year Catholics should boycott the old boys. Mothers should not allow their young children near the Roman Church. Power is the only thing the creeps who run \"the Universal Church\" understand. If women quit the Church en masse, the Church hierarchy would reinvent itself pretty quickly (by Church time, anyway). If the Church survives in its present form, it will do so with the complicity of female parishioners. It's up to you, ladies.

Raised a Catholic and now Muslim over 20 years I agree with you there is no difference between the two religions when one becomes unbalanced and extremist.  The right balance for Catholic priests would be to REQUIRE marriage as only then can one sympathize and understand the problems of those one would deign to guide.  As for Islam I was in Pakistan when the Taliban was in its infancy and I have no doubt that their extremism comes not just from the radical Imams they encountered but rather from the total lack of women in their upbringing in the Saudi funded madrasas.<br />The change in the church wont ever come from Rome, it will have to come from its victims seeking justice and transparency from the church, as well as from women becoming more involved in its hierarchy and on Sunday.  Until reform comes women will have to step up and do what they can to prevent abuse in their own parishes.  This means mandatory reporting of all abuse to the police.

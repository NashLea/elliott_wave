Is it not the prospect of making profits what is behind the years of research, clinical trials, regulatory compliance, and investment of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to develop new pharmaceuticals? As we speak, pharmaceutical companies are spending huge amounts of money, and have been doing so for decades, to develop treatments for such vexing diseases as cancer, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes.

The Tea Party and its adherents, although representing a tiny but very active and dedicated minority, i.e. Bolshevik, has been extremely successful in organizing at a grass roots level; e.g. school boards, state legislatures etc. by running a story of how the pointy headed liberal \"elite\" are the ones responsible for the desperate lives that so many folks lead.  It doesn't matter whether that desperation is due to economic disparity and/or simple fear of change. The ideologues that promote this story know well how to ride the fierce energy of desperation.

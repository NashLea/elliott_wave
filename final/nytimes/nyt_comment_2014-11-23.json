Yes there were the occasional heartbeats but never again would the United States America be a nation that led the Western democracies into the 21st century.<br/>The wealth and military power would continue but the six year attack on a president who twice won office playing by the rules seems a clear indication that the mightiest nation that has ever existed is dysfunctional both within and outside its border.<br/>Today's story about Texas history books certainly echoes the prophetic words of George Orwell's 1984. Many of us were alive when Ronald Wilson Reagan proved his paucity of courage when as head of the Screen Actors Guild he went before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and the head of the FBI and proceeded to name names of his guild members who were engaged in a nonexistent plot to subvert the US government. Tomorrow Texas history books will demand Reagan's face on Mount Rushmore.<br/>The claim of President Obama wanting to become an Imperial president is simply absurd when his white hair clearly indicates the Empire and certainly the country's main concern is survival not empire.

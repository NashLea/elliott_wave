If you look at Afghanistan, it was not always a war ravaged mess.  The Soviet invasion certainly altered (literally and figuratively) the landscape of Afghanistan.  However before this, Afghanistan was a country of religious tolerance, relative peace, and beginning a trend towards modernity.  The policies of King Amanullah and later Zahir Shah helped mold Afghanistan into a nation with a modern constitution, parliament, universal suffrage, etc.  If the Soviets never invaded, who knows how Afghanistan might have turned out. However, it's useless to speculate.  Given the many changes Afghanistan has undergone in the 20th century, it's not out of the realm of possibility for a \"Western Style Democracy\" to exist.<br /><br />Furthermore, it's incorrect for to say that we are trying to remake Afghanistan in our own image. While Afghanistan does have a bicameral legislature and a president, if you examine it's judicial branch and its laws, it certainly does not resemble anything that you'd see in the United States, Great Britain, or anywhere in the Western world.  While there is a civil law code, the code can best be described as Shariah Law (of which there are several schools of jurisprudence...too complicated for a forum post).  Furthermore, I believe a great deal of governance is convened through a \"Loya Jirga\" which essentially is a mass \"tribal\" counsel.  That being said, Afghanistan's government is a combination of Islamic, Western and Tribal governance.<br /><br />The premise of \"government in a box\" seems absurd to you and many others.  However, it is necessary in such an operation.  The government needs to be on the ground providing services for its people to maintain its legitimacy.  While in practice it may not work, its essential for the Karzai government to be on the ground providing services and governance to achieve or maintain the loyalty of Afghans.<br /><br />Your last comment is an irrelevant observation given our discussion.  Afghanistan has been ravaged by 30 years of devastating warfare.  After the Taliban were removed from power in 2001, the rebuilding process started from scratch.  In essence, there were no institutions other than Islam to build upon. Because of this, you do not a massive widespread insurrection.  The forces we face in Afghanistan are primarily Islamist groups such as the Taliban/Haqqani Network, Hezb-i-Islami (Gulbuddin) and al-Qaeda who are vying to recapture power in Afghanistan.  America on the other hand has institutions and governance in place which have existed for over 200 years.  To compare the two is apples and oranges my friend.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1180759, "replies": [], "lft": 108, "assetURL": "http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/just-who-are-we-fighting-in-marja/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1596557, "rgt": 109, "userDisplayName": "a", "createDate": "1266714249", "userID": 2509526, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266735527", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266735527", "commentSequence": 57, "commentBody": "Tony, from 'The South' wrote, \"Hmmm, i wonder if all the anti-US commenters on this blog would have a comfortable time inviting the Taliban to their house for dinner and some convivial political conversations.\"<br /><br />No, Tony, I wouldn't be confortable inviting the Taliban to my house.

What I want to know is why should such a huge percentage of my hard-earned tax dollars is being spent on useless military adventurism that has little to no chance of long-term success.  I want people in my neighborhood to get a decent education and a decent job, so that they can have a decent life and not rob or kill me out of desperation.  All the billions we spend on these useless adventures overseas may provide jobs to the military and defense contractors, but they do nothing about the infrastructural problems we have right here at home - problems we need to solve quickly if our society is going to stay even remotely healthy and competitive into the 21st century.  It is not ANTI-USA to ask that teenagers and early 20-somethings in the prime of their life not DIE for some ill-defined mission of NATION-BUILDING in one of the poorest countries on earth.

Because of  the power of 9/11 in the American psyche, trying to change anybody's perspective is virtually impossible.

Actions as consequential as shutting down the government and not paying our bills should require a Constitutional majority, that is, a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, and approval by the President (or larger majorities in the House and Senate if the President vetoes).  That's what majority rule in our democracy requires.  The current situation is the opposite of majority rule, because of a simple flaw: routine government operations (including borrowing to pay our bills) terminate by default, allowing a minority to block historically routine continuing resolutions and raising the debt ceiling.  Congress never intended to \"sunset\" these routine operations of government.  There is a simple fix for this flaw: reverse the default and undo the implicit \"sunset\".  For these routine operations of government (upon which world confidence in the United States depends), the law should be that these operations continue absent a Constitutional majority to the contrary.  Of course, no Constitutional majority (House, Senate, and President) would be so foolish as to shutdown the routine operations of government or stop paying our bills, but that's the point.

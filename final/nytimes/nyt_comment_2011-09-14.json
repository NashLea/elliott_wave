We're getting so top heavy the bottom is going to fall out soon; I wonder where that will leave our economy then? I'm not a communist or anything- but unless we find some way to redistribute the wealth the capitalist system will break. Capitalism works on the assumption people have purchasing power- but a large majority of people in the US no longer do. <br/><br/>The reality is that the poor do manage to \"scrape\" by with the little they have- but they're forced to live from check to check paying off essential bills, rent, and buying food and gas. There is no money there to to buy consumer goods or save- and many live in constant credit card debt. I know my own mother- when her husband couldn't find a job for 9 months, managed to get a job (paying 1/10 what he made). Only one of them can work at a time since child care is too expensive. It helps that they own their house so they aren't paying rent or a mortgage, but at the end of the month, even after all cuts, they're sunk under credit card payments from essentials they needed to purchase while neither of them had a job. <br/><br/>It shouldn't be an issue of \"Class warfare,\" its an issue of whats best for the United States. The poor don't want to steal money from the rich, they want the opportunity to work and be paid fairly for their work. The poor don't want charity, they want to be independent, but its impossible to live off \"Walmart Wages.\" The rich should realize that if things continue as they are, they will suffer as well. Rather than let it get to a point of no return, we should agree as Americans to restructure our economic and government system that benefits greater equality between income groups. <br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying communism is the answer, but if corporations aren't willing to change themselves, the last choice is government intervention. <br/><br/>1. $10-$12 minimum wage<br/>\n2.

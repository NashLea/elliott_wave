This teacher is in absolute full control of her words, her demeanor, her  approach, and her intended outcome. She is smart, thoughtful, and is using a particular approach to educating her students. I, for one, disagree with it, but I see that it is studied and carefully planned. The student who was berated was not alarmed or surprised, and knew EXACTLY where to go and why. The other students were also fully cognizant of the level of fear they were intended to feel and why. How on earth could this be called a \"momentary lapse\" when the teacher articulates her \"deep disappointment\" with such complete control. We can choose controlling, patriarchal, nearly violent and abusive methods to teach our students, which are common in some other large, rival countries, or we can choose otherwise. The difference is whether we are trying to educate students to live in a future despotic regime, or in what we used to think of as a democracy. And if you think I'm joking about \"abusive,\" what on earth kind of person thinks that using language like that with sensitive children could possibly be appropriate or lead to the development of the kinds of people we hope will live in our society in the future?

Now, when I get the 10K form, which is the yearly report from those companies, the great majority of them show certain funds as having significant holdings. Among them are Black Rock, KKR, and Vanguard. So basically I have the same stocks they bought, and charge you to manage on a continuing basis. I bought them for $8.95, so a 100 share purchase cost me $.085 a share or less depending on how many I bought, and I only pay that fee once.<br/><br/>You can go to the companies websites look at their statement, and see who owns 5% or more of stock in the company. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway has 360,000,000 shares of Wells Fargo, and Buffett personally has 3,000,000 shares. <br/><br/>So you pay some fee to people who buy what you can buy, and they also get to profit with your money. But worse yet, even if the fund loses, they still get paid, and you can end up paying a capital gains tax if they sell, in order to give their holders money back.<br/><br/>Of course if a fund does not perform, people will go to another one, but that does not help those who lost with that fund. Worse yet, when the market falls, people panic and sell, so the fund sells to get cash to pay its investors.

The German population (as well as that of many other eurozone countries) do not want to introduce such a system of  permanent subsidies (it is also against the rules that all countries of the Eurozone have agree upon). So Schaeuble - presumably in accordance with many of the other Eurozone finance minsters -  has offered Greece debt relief in exchange for Greece leaving the Euro.

Roger, thank you for some of the most euphoric moments in my life over the last few years. Since Roger's form dropped, I lost a part of my life which I have not been able to replace - he is the most beautiful player I have ever seen.

Nole is an incredibly good sport.  All of his opponents say the same including....Federer, Nadal, Wawranka, Sock, Isner.  But clearly, during your time on tour, you have evidenced otherwise.  If he wants to eat a piece of grass after his win or raise his hand up as a religious gesture this somehow offends you.  And you will also hold him responsible for the draw.  Really?  Who here is being a sore loser?", "recommendationCount": 4}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

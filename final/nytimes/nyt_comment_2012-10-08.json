The Constitutional provision quoted above indeed explicitly defines the essence of a \"patent\" and a \"copyright.,\" as understood in 1787 or 2012. Whether those specific words are used, or some other word, has no substantive significance. In any event, the one example given above of an alternative \"sui generis\" form of intellectual property -- \"plant variety protection\" -- is also called a \"patent.\" (See 35 USC 161, \"Patents for plants.\") But it just as well may be called something else, and still be a \"patent.\"<br/><br/>2. It is true, however, that the Constitution does not define the specific terms and conditions for obtaining a patent or a copyright. That was left to Congress. And one of the very first acts that Congress passed pursuant to the Constitution was the 1790 Patent Act (which says something about the importance that the Founding Fathers and Congress placed on patents). Since then, the terms and conditions have changed from time to time. <br/><br/>3. To talk about radically and unilaterally changing, if not eliminating, the U.S. patent system in some of the extreme ways suggested here -- although PERHAPS Constitutional -- is impractical and unrealizable in today's global economy and society. There are now numerous international treaties and agreements that bind the signatories to all sorts of intellectual-property protections and conditions.

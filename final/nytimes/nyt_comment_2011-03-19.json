I'm not objective.  I love Barack Obama.  And if you believe that Obama will not stay firm on his word you're wrong.  Obama offered the terms that Western and Arab nations expect.  You will see a quick action if Libya fails to respond.  The American Presidency is bigger than Barack Obama and he knows that it also is riding on this.  America must follow through with declarations.  Ultimately though we must remember that this is Barack Obama.  He has a pattern of action.  He always tends to wait a little longer than everybody wants him too and then he thrusts himself in to a decision.  He considers things extensively and waits for them to play out - sometimes longer than people would like.  But ultimately when he commits he's in.  This decision is not a no brainer and Obama wants the Arab world to keep determining its own fate.  But Gaddafi has introduced a new approach to dealing with protesters - which is to use violence.  And in some way, Western powers must support the rebels in this case.  Its the moral thing to do.  And it aligns very closely with the goals of Western nations which is primarily a spreading of open markets and open societies.  For countries that want this for themselves, Western nations must support them.  Where would the U.S. be without the support of France in the 18th century in its own revolution?  Supporting new democracies is the job of established democracies, and Obama - as expected - is making the right choice for the good of this country.

Rick's echo, in comment # 65 can't put it better but I'll try.<br /><br />To me, Seattle is just like an abusive, clinically-depressed but unmedicated, beautiful, intense Nordic woman with hidden class issues and an education complex who's single parent worked for Boeing. Poor beginnings, some hard work and cosmetic improvements helped her get lucky and noticed. As a city, she meant well, but she was too cool, too emotionally distant, at times boosted by an artificial sense of self-esteem. My experience of Seattle as that she asked for more than she gave, and gave less than she was worth. She's nice to look at, but the terrible infrastructure made it impossible to get around and being earthquake prone - she is far to resistant to change.<br /><br />After a 6 week road trip camping cross country, I \"lived\" in Seattle with my fatal attraction for about a month in November 2008 just before committing to our original desperate plan to move together to Hawaii. My lover was a genuine Seattleite and introduced me to her version of the city with pride and gusto. To quote mike Tyson: Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.<br /><br />What a remarkable and deceptively appealing introduction it was to the jewel of the Continental Pacific Northwest! To be in love and old enough to know better as the economy plunged lower each day makes all the difference when discovering the nuances of a new city. Indeed, I was shocked at the raw beauty, the cleanliness, the surface friendliness - we must have had 2 consecutive weeks without rain in November.<br /><br />In retrospect, I think I got to experience the best and worst of Seattle as a city through her (and our disintegrating relationship). In my mind, Seattle truly had it all but the weather - great companies, great people, great scenery, great real estate (at the time!) - it was everything I thought I wanted, and yes, everything I thought needed in a city. Hell, for that for a fabulously miserable month I was actually convinced i could make babies and grow old there!<br /><br />Heading back home to NYC, driving east on I-90 after picking up my trusty Jeep from her mom's garage in March 09, completely broke and broken hearted following three glorious and brutal months all alone in Hawaii I finally realized it was all an elaborate dream.<br /><br />Seattle was was killing me and I could never really live there.<br /><br />Of course, every now and then I think maybe, just maybe... i could go to school there.<br /><br />But actually live in Seattle?

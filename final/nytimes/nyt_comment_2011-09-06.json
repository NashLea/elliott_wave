The post office is still really an arm of the U.S. Government and we all know it.

There are many areas in the USA that only receive mail through the USPS.<br/>\nCurrently the USPS works with commercial carriers to take over where the commercial carriers leave off.

The problem is the public worker unions have created pay scales and retirement benefits that are unsustainable through the post offices revenue from stamps and shipping fees alone. Thus for years they need tax payer subsidies to balance their books.<br/>\nAdditionally as a bureaucracy they have inherent waste that is normal for any bureaucracy VS a private sector for profit company that can\u2019t survive year after year in the red.\r<br/><br/>The worst liability the USPS faces is they are prevented by the unions from laying off thousands of unneeded employees. As people use email more, and a bad economy slows commerce and shipping, the post office is forced by big labor unions to pay for thousands of employees it doesn\u2019t need.\r<br/><br/>Get rid of the corrupt unions, and the USPS could return to the respected institution it was originally designed to be. At very least, limit unreasonable union terms that result in continual deficits at every level of government in pretty much every state in the country.\r<br/><br/>Civil service means you work at the behest of the tax payer.

The 3rd guy exited the vehicle after many minutes and started touching up a fire hydrant with yellow paint. Eventually the job was done, (about an hour) and they left.\r<br/><br/>A few days later I saw a similar truck at another fire hydrant. This time 2 guys were there. One was resting in the passenger seat while another was painting another fire hydrant.\r<br/><br/>Maybe they were on their mandatory union break or something, but this is an example of too many people sent to do a tiny job.

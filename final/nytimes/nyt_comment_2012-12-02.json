EMR systems don't communicate with each other. ergo the only people benefitting from EMR's are hospitals and EMR software companies and their techs.<br/>\n5.)

That can be an eye opener.  <br/><br/>HMO good care may be given for ordinary circumstances; have a very complicated and potentially expensive condition and patient treatment options may change considerably.  <br/><br/>There is constant inside pressure on HMO medical providers to keep costs down and \"good statistics\" on patient care up.  Good statistics can include things such as how many patients are seen in an hour, how many hours a week are expected to be filled with returning clinical patients, how many hours were given to new patients, whether or not any patients were seen more times than generally dictated by the employer HMO.  These are just some.  There are definite consequences to the professional employee for failure to adhere to corporate expectations.  <br/><br/>HMO's are corporations.

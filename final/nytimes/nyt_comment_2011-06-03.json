However, I started kindergarten at 6 (after one year of preschool). Even with my September 1 birthday, I was by no means the oldest in my class. That's just when kids started school in that district back in the mid 1980s. I really don't think that my mom thought of it as giving me some kind of academic advantage.<br/><br/>My grades were close to perfect until middle school (at which time I dropped back to the \"regular gifted\" classes), but I was never bored in school. And I certainly was not bored at home for the first five years of my life before starting preschool! We read a lot and didn't watch much TV. To this day, my three siblings and I (with varying degrees of success in school) love to read, are intellectually curious, and enjoy music and other creative endeavors. None of my siblings went to preschool.<br/><br/>My daughter, almost two, has a late August birthday. She is quite tall but pretty average, so far, in terms of social and intellectual development. I had been wondering, until I read this post and all the comments, \"Will I send her to kindergarten at 5 or 6?\" Imagine my surprise, then, to learn that kids are now starting kindergarten at FOUR. Sending her when she's turning 5 is now practically redshirting!<br/><br/>Childhood seems to be falling by the wayside. A world in which a four-year-old has to sit still and do homework is tragic. Studies have, time and again, shown that kids learn best by playing. Parents who cannot afford childcare should not have to worry that, by putting their kids in school at 4, they are subjecting them to homework and routines they are not ready for. Let 'em play!<br/><br/>As parents, instilling a love of learning in our children is vitally important. Teaching them to conjure a (legal and safe) way out of boredom is equally important. If we do that, our kids are that much closer to being successful in school. Putting four year olds in kindergarten is not the solution.<br/><br/>Of course, since some of the recent comments are all about the blame game, I'll just cut to the chase: the reason why there are so many problems in the public schools is because moms work outside the home, myself included. Shame on me.

Farmers value self reliance, independence, creativity, industriousness, financial integrity, frugality, responsible behavior, and hard work (sun up to sun down, 10-12 months per year); mostly traits incompatible with the gradual but clear socialist path the US is taking.\"<br/><br/>I would say that these are values that are not unique to conservatives. Nor are all rural families conservative. Growing up amongst both hippie organic farmers and old-time New Englanders in Maine - both socially liberal (on average) groups - these are values that I was raised with. Especially frugality, out of necessity.<br/><br/>I escaped the country as farming was in its last dying throes in my area. But as I've become, more or less, a self-made member of the coastal elite, I still value these values. They've made me a good student at a fancy university, and a good worker in various office jobs. One day, I hope, they'll make me a good professor - the antithesis of the rural farmworker of popular mythology. Assuming that industriousness, frugality, and self-reliance are unique to farm families, and correlate with conservative politics, is not true. In my own experience, these are values that will be as applicable as I attempt to become a professor in the social sciences as they would be if I decided to be a farmer in the rural area where I grew up.<br/><br/>This assumption that good values correlate with rural living is, I believe, part of what people in this conversation may be reacting to when they express scorn for the rural areas of the country. In the myth of America, the countryside is industrious and supports the lazy city folk. We all know that's not true, but it still comes up again and again. It's annoying to everyone, in some way or another. Having lived on \"both sides\", it's clear that people are people everywhere, under many socioeconomic conditions. Some are hard-working, some aren't; some do great things for their communities, and some are selfish jerks.

This year is especially bad as i have one kid going off to middle school and one in k who will be retained, for a variety of reasons. LOTS of activities requiring a parent to be present, and to donate time, and money, and flowers and food and tablecloths and etc. Even the 12 year old thinks it's a bit much, \"some of it's kinda stupid, mom\" but still, I try to step up. \r<br/><br/>And then there's the collections for 'teacher appreciation' gifts. Alas, that's the culture here-each family is encouraged to give 20$ per teacher. With 25 kids in a class, that's a tidy sum!  This places me in a bit of a dilemma as my older kids teacher is stellar and I'm more than happy to donate, but the younger one's teacher has been unresponsive to my concerns at best, and defensive at worst, so i'm NOT appreciative and don't want to give that teacher a frickin' dime,  and i'm not going to either!\r<br/><br/>  I'll proctor the dance, Ill take the day off (out of my hardwon vacation time) to attend the \"promotion ceremony'and i'll cook and clean and generally be present as i always am, as will my husband,  but with a little hard kernel of resentment towards the littler kids teacher who is thankfully taking the leave of absence next year that should have been taken this year.  at least we as a family won't have that inflicted on us again.

She takes over at such a pivotal time in journalism's history.  With all the competition for spin I hope she will be vigilant in resisting the temptation to manipulate events with propaganda posing as news.  I was very disappointed with the NYT's collaboration with the Republicans and right-wing media in the 2-year-long, incessant campaign to present the 2010 \"Republican Resurgence\" as a foregone conclusion. The reporting was biased, inaccurate, and misleading. I hope that  Ms. Abramson will be strict and steadfast in maintaining a higher level of real journalism than that.

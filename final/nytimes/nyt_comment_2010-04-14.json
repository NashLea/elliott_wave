In fact, in theory, you are right.<br /><br />But we live in a country where the votes of 5 Justices, each one voting against his or her stated principles regarding states' rights, ended a valid recount ordered by the state's supreme court, thus throwing the election to their favored candidate. We live in a country where election shenanigans are de rigueur; in fact, the Ohio election that gave the next federal election to that same candidate, was full of irregularities. And in Oklahoma, state legislators are now proposing to raise an armed militia to fight off the federal government. And an army lieutenant colonel who is a doctor has refused to be deployed because he doesn't believe the current Commander in Chief -- who was elected by a wide margin -- is legitimate.<br /><br />In other words, we don't provide a great moral example of free &amp; fair elections or respect for legitimate election results.<br /><br />If there is some way to get rid of Karzai &amp; Al-Malaki, the citizens of their countries must do that, not NATO forces or the U.S. Hey, how about impeachment? We can show them how to do that, too!

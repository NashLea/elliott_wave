Since I mow live in Portland, I frequently visit, often with my family. Parc 55 is an extremely comfortable hotel with lovely rooms and views. pilots were checking in the same -- to our delight -- they know where to get the best night's sleep. Triton you want to love, but the rooms are very small and the attitude heavy. Attentiveness by the young, restless staff is spotty. The best part about Triton is the Cafe Des La Press adjacent. Delightful, white table, French bistro, wonderful morning coffee with newspapers galore. Wouldn't chose a hotel at civic center, so recommendations above for $100 a night seem off. Don't overlook chain hotels like Marriott, either. I just booked a Courtyard by Marriott on 2nd street, a stylish room with pillow rolls on the beds, 42 inch plazma, a comfortable desk, views and free wi-fi for $102 dollars. It has an indoor pool/hot soak tub. We're driving with kids -- ideal. The Clift gives the locals a little chuckle with it's pretentious giant, top-lit chair off the lobby. Man's serch for meaning? Chic Paul Bunyon? We checked in once to find a bland, slightly worn room and young kids splayed across duffel bags at check in -- We checked out and into the Nikko hotel nearby. They were running a promotion, and we had a lovely breakfast with lattes made to order at the Concierge Level every am, with views of the Bay Bridge and city bustle from the 22nd floor. The server was the most thoughtful,  polite person -- I wrote a note to the hotel, pointing out his contributions. television screen imbeded in the bathroom mirror is up for discussion, but we enjoyed the futuristic, Japonesque indulgence. One small complaint -- our room smelled mildly of curry through our stay. The Personality Hotel chain is one we've experienced, too. Our stay at the Diva was memorable and the room was big enough to entertain our close friends in a separate seating area. It had an \"urban warehouse made comfy feel,\" modern and artsy, but with a small bathroom. Famous David's Deli was just up the street. Personality Hotels do do lots of fun promotions as Joie de Vive. While young hipsters want an experience around the mainstream, I have to say that assurance of a good nights' sleep and privacy in a hub location has moved me past any hipster test or snobbery mode and embrace the 4th street Marriot, too. Our family got another deal online. I was skeptical if I could love it: the views were fabulous, room clean and fashionable and beds were majorly sleep-worthy! Large marble bathroom a plus.. great location: SSMOMA, Zeum, Cartoon Museum, all nearby. A Christopher Wren style church that stands elbow to elbow with the Lanky Mariott pealed it's bell daily, embuing our views of the sparkling waters and reflected cars crossing the Bridge with Von Trapp sentimentality! The lobby is busy, boring and cold. There is a Starbucks, but the Mission is just a few blocks away, filled with glorious bakeries and eateries.

But the main deterrent to me bringing a dedicated camera along at all is that it's to much of a hassle keeping all the stuff pertaining to the camera organized.<br /><br />I use my iPhone for most photographs that actually get taken, rather than my expensive Nikon SLR or my rather nice Sony compact camera.<br /><br />Would I have the pocket space for a dedicated higher quality camera? Sure.<br /><br />So why don't I - ever - bring my nice cameras along? They rest permanently in my equipment closet, together with a couple of RC helicopters, a handfull of RC cars, my high-quality flatbed scanner, my stationary computer, my various GPS-equipment, and my collection of high-powered flashlights.<br /><br />Quality is secondary when it comes to consumer level electronics. Ease of use is really the only thing that matters.<br /><br />I don't mind having single-purpose gear, as long as it is immediately useful out of the box. For example, I use my high precision laser distance measuring device plenty - even though all it does is measure distances. If I would have to upgrade the firmware of the distance measuring device - even just the once - or ever bring it out of its dedicated space without being able to use it immediately, it would go straight to the \"unusable technology closet\".<br /><br />A piece of gear needs to do it's job with a great degree of predictability and a reasonable degree of elegance in order for it to defend it's space in the consciousness of the user.<br /><br />So:<br />Separate battery charger - Straight to the \"unusable technology closet\".<br />More than one physical entity to keep track of - Straight to the closet.<br />Even a half-inch larger than anything else that does almost the same thing - Straight to the closet.<br />Not beautiful - Straight to the closet.<br /><br />Now, whilst some of the gear in my \"unusable technology closet\" was really nice to buy, and maybe even defended its space in my consciousness for a while, I stopped using it for the same reason: It takes to much conscious thought to keep working.<br /><br />The best camera is the one that you have on your person when cool stuff happens. The best phone is the one that makes it possible to order pizza to your friends house at 1 am. The best toy is the one that is immediately accessible when you have your unexpected 2-minute break from everyday chores.<br /><br />It goes further than this: The best bullet shooting rifle is the one that is available when you happen upon a bunch of deer outside buckshot distance whilst hunting for geese. The best coffee is the cup that you can get within one minute of thinking of it.<br /><br />Ease of use, small footprint, low degree of direct-access-downtime, and immediate utility are all good things. Removable batteries are a hindrance to all these good things.<br /><br />In my work as a physician, it's practical to have easy access to radiological imaging techniques, blood analyses, and a large staff of highly specialized colleagues. I wouldn't regularly bring any of these resources with me on my vacation though.<br /><br />Similarly, if I were a professional photographer, I'd draw great utility from the ability to shoot several thousand high-quality stills on a work field trip. But I still wouldn't bring the SLR Nikon on my summer vacation, I'd just use my iPhone.<br /><br />Best,<br />Erik Nilsson", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1247141, "replies": [], "lft": 94, "assetURL": "http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/microsofts-free-sync-service/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1690493, "rgt": 95, "userDisplayName": "roadrunnerstall", "createDate": "1268446835", "userID": 15502069, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268549594", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Michigan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268549594", "commentSequence": 46, "commentBody": "I believe some of you missed the point of the article.

However, SugarSync, like Dropbox or Live Mesh, does provide cloud storage. I personally don't share David's excitement about Live Sync because it clearly does NOT  \"keeping the latest versions of everything accessible at all times.\" Now way to get at that spreadsheet on your office computer from home when the former is turned off.

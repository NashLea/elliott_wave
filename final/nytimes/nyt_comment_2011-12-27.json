Medicaid eligibility is automatically established for people who are SSI eligible, but that is not a cash program.   The old much-reviled Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program was eliminated in 1996 and replaced with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, which allows very low income parents to get cash assistance to support their families.  The TANF program requires parents to look for work or engage in job training programs, and there is a five year limitation on receipt of these benefits.  It is very difficult to find housing and pay for the necessities of life on a TANF allotment, but a still popular belief has parents choosing not to work and get paid by the government to crank out babies.

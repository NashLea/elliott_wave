Can we really not get a helmet for all of our allied soldiers? I know four-year-olds riding bikes on suburban streets who take more safety precautions. (There must be some explanation for the lack of helmets, but it is hard to imagine that it is sensible.)<br/>2. The U.S. damn well better stand by the Kurds in their struggle for independence because they have been our toughest allies for a long, long time in extremely dirty conflict. We abandoned them under Reagan, and again under Bush the First. It's time we did right by these people and helped them achieve independent nation status so they are not subjected to nationalistic tyranny again! P.S.

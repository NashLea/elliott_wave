Having grown up in the suburbs and finishing high school in Upstate New York, I found the smaller school environment (a K-12 student body of not even 900) a better fit than a suburban school. But each individual with AS is different, and that should be accounted for.<br/><br/>Riley-Hall's article was a phenomenal read, especially as her author's page has her from New York, so it's comfort knowing that. I've spoken on behalf of a professor of special education (at my college, which is known for it's teaching programs) about what it is like having Asperger's. I tell these future teachers to not have the students feel excluded from regular classroom activities, and for parents to let their special needs child take on a challenging endeavor. If a teen with AS wants to enroll in an AP class in high school, and if they are mature enough to handle it, then by all means let them. Given the right encouragement, assistance and environment, a teen with AS can flourish.

The New Yorker Magazine did a piece a couple of years back which stated that an extraordinarily high percentage of the adults living in Florida hold real estate licenses. This shows, among other things, that there isn't much else to do there besides sell houses to newcomers and sell services to tourists. It is a state built on dreams, illusions and sunny days rather than substance and industrial productivity of any sort. The housing bubble started in Florida and when it burst, the results hit the state with a very hard thud. <br/><br/>Virtually none of our states could stand on their own if they were modest size independent nations. Texas? Highly dependent on the federal govt. for agricultural subsides, defense expenditures and favorable tax treatment for the oil business. States like Pennsylvania and Ohio might have a fighting chance, because they still have a good deal of manufacturing. California, because of the size of its economy, might also be a candidate to survive on its own. <br/><br/>Those who complain constantly about the role of the federal govt. should remember that the amelioration of state and regional differences (conflicts) is part of what makes us successful.

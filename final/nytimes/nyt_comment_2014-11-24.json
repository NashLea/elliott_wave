Frankfurt recently joined Europe's other major financial center, London, in establishing a mechanism for settling commercial transactions in renminbi.  Russia, hounded by Western sanctions, is moving towards direct trade with China unmediated by dollars.  OPEC will be tempted to do the same as indigenous American fossil fuels-production reduces our country's significance as an import destination.  Both Democratic and Republican administrations have depended on third parties to soak up the massive amounts of dollars printed for decades by the Federal Reserve to amortize the ever-growing federal debt.  Third party-demand for dollars will decrease, as Hemingway said in a disturbingly similar context, first gradually, than all of a sudden.  As that demand decreases, inflation will inevitably increase; both Republican weapons systems and Democratic social welfare programs will become harder to finance without massively increasing taxes.

Why is it that the people who actually know the most about how the economy functions support the right? Why is it that most of the great economists of the 20th Century (Milton Friedman, F.A. Hayek, etc.) were right wingers?<br/>\nCould you please explain why if you go to any college or university or community college in this country, almost all of the economics professors are right-wingers? Hmmmm???\u201d<br/><br/>Perhaps this could explain your inquiry:<br/><br/>It is likely that these economics professors you are referring to have lucrative consulting arrangements with Wall Street. What is significant is that they rarely disclose such conflicts of interest in scholarly papers, media appearances, to their students, or when they testify before Congress.  For example, economists do not have to abide by a professional code of ethics as lawyers and psychologists are required to. <br/><br/>\u201cEpstein, a professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst, recently released a paper that \u201cscrutinized the behavior of 19 economists who made policy pronouncements about financial reform after the 2008 [banking] crisis. Thirteen of them, it turned out, worked as consultants, as directors, or in other capacities for banks, rating agencies and investment firms ... And only two of those 13 economists routinely disclosed those financial ties in their academic papers and in their news-media appearances.\u201d (Potter, 2011, The Daily Princeton). <br/><br/>Below is a more detailed description:<br/>\n\u201cThey found that, of the 19 scholars studied, 13 did some work for private financial institutions. Two were co-founders and held key positions in such firms. Another economist worked for two banks -- as president of one and as director of another. Eight served on the boards of directors of private financial firms, while two were identified as consultants or affiliated experts for firms. Epstein and Carrick-Hagenbarth determined these affiliations mostly through the economists\u2019 curriculums vitae.<br/>\nIn their public statements and scholarly writings, very few of the economists acknowledged their private affiliations -- even though they might opine on policies that could have an impact on the firms that paid them, Epstein and Carrick-Hagenbarth found. Typically, the economists identified themselves by their academic position or their membership in the National Bureau for Economic Research; sometimes it was by their appointment to prestigious public or international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund.<br/>\nSeven of the economists -- including a president, several trustees and those who served on the boards of directors of private financial firms -- failed to mention their relationship to these firms during nearly 80 media appearances. While one economist divulged his or her dealings in all 25 appearances, three others did so only occasionally -- in one-third of 63 op-eds and interviews.<br/>\n (Chronicle of Higher Education, Jan. 7, 2011.)", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 2702800, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/haley-to-g-o-p-candidates-its-go-time/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3787281, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "Mark", "createDate": "1304644928", "userID": 39024359, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304654836", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Tucson,Az", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304651236", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "The Republican dwarfs compared to President Obama!", "recommendationCount": 13}, {"assetID": 2703251, "replies": [], "lft": 12, "assetURL": "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/republicans-debate-in-south-carolina/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3787468, "rgt": 13, "userDisplayName": "Rachel", "createDate": "1304647842", "userID": 36865300, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1304654836", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1304651236", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "Laughable.

That's why I call you fake skeptics.  True science is based on skepticism, but you guys hew to the denialist canon without deviation.<br/><br/>Of course, you'd regard five separate investigations of the email theft and careful selective publication which have completely cleared anyone of anything but indiscretion and anger at the total disconnect between truth, observation, reality and the inflation of false information from the fake skeptic movement (and you guys are really angry when you make these blanket statement, about which it is hard not to use the L word (\"lies\")).<br/><br/>Kevin Trenberth:<br/>\n B.Sc.

You know what they say, a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words. It also holds up as evidence in a court of law as opposed to heresay.  I also thought I made it clear I wasn\u2019t discussing the cause of glacial retreat, and for the record an ice flow is not the same thing.

It appears to me that very few are willing to talk about either human population dynamics or the unscientific foundation of demographic transition theory. The former is assiduously ignored, even though it appears to explain why human population numbers have been skyrocketing in our time, while the latter has been broadcast during my lifetime, even though the theory of demographic transition could be misleading all of us by giving rise to a false promise that human population growth is somehow about to come benignly to an end soon. The silence with regard to human population science as well as the broadcasts of preternatural pseudoscientific thought regarding the demographic transition theory are significant forces with which we have to reckon, I suppose.\r", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

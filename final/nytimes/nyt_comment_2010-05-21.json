It doesn't tell us anything about any other cohort.  It may be an interesting bit of historical evidence about the effects of differences in the 60s and 70s, but it is not probative of what families starting out today can reasonably expect to experience.<br /><br />The study excludes home equity, meaning it probably captures wealth in the form of financial assets.  But it is my understanding that many African Americans have historically been distrustful of large financial institutions so that preference may have been a factor in the different returns over the years.<br /><br />There is the issue of compounding.  Discriminatory effects earlier on can compound over time even if the amount of discrimination in our society has declined since then.<br /><br />It is impossible to identify causality / allocate responsibility for differences in performance for the outcomes in this study.

Greece needs tax reform and so does the US but for different reasons.  In Greece no one pays tax because of corruption.  In the US so few pay tax because of the system.  With so few paying tax only those paying their fair share of tax should be allowed to complain.  A much more liberal / fair and perhaps slightly socialist viewpoint, would be to make everyone pay their fair share of taxes.  1 way of doing this would be to enforce the tax regime / rules (in the Greek case) and for the US to introduce a VAT - or some other similar broad based low-rate consumption tax.<br />A good example of how to do this might be Canada with its GST model.

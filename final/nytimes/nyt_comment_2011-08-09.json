It struck me as extremely sensible and conservative, and I graduated in 1959 with great admiration for Keynes' good sense. Only later did I realize that in the real world, where economics is subordinate to politics, Keynes' teachings are routinely and shamelessly misused to justify the running of deficits in both bad and good times. This is not Keynes' fault; in a better world than this, his prescription would undoubtedly work.

Another reason for the numerical decline of American doctors is the fact that the profession is so much more difficult and frustrating to practice properly due to a host of non medical factors, such as our dysfunctional delivery system. I base this solely on my experience of 33 years in practice. I am not sophisticated enough to know how to improve medicine in the US. I leave that to people like Dr. Andrew Patterson who is not only a leading educator here, but also brings talented teams of surgeons and anesthesiologists from his Stanford University to Gitwe Hospital each year, the African home of our medical school. I do feel I can help make a difference in Rwanda, however. Africa has 25% of the world's medical needs and 3% of health care providers, percentages reflected in Rwanda. A private medical school is going up to help address this problem directly, and contributions to the Kigali Medical University Foundation (KMUF.org) go 100% to aid this cause in a highly efficient manner.<br/>\nI would like to embarrassedly thank my friend Guy Mastrion for his words. Guy and his firm, Palio (<a href=\"http://www.Palio.com)\" title=\"www.Palio.com)\" target=\"_blank\">www.Palio.com)</a>, have been very generous to KMUF.

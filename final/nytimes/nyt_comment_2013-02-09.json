Do not read this if you cry easily. 38A reminded me of this and now the only way I can shed my grief is to share it. We once owned a home in Connecticut with a pond in the rear.  The house had a deck in the rear facing the pond.  One spring a new family of Mallard ducks came to our pond.  As the mother was swimming around the pond with her ducklings, one got pulled under.  Alas, the duckling had been attacked by the resident snapping turtle which had bitten off the duckling\u2019s foot.  He survived. He would spend the evenings under a small tree along the pond while the rest of the family went to a more secure nest for the night. He grew up, despite the dangers of the raccoons and foxes that lurked in the surrounding forest. We named the footless duck Peggy, short for Pegleg. Peggy grew into an adult and took Gwendolyn as his bride. They made a cute couple. They would even come onto the deck for their cracked corn and even feed out of our hands. Peggy and Gwendolyn had a family of their own. They would arrive to our pond in the morning and spend the day but return to their nest across the road. Sadly, one evening as they were crossing the highway Gwendolyn, protecting her young, unsuccessfully fended off an oncoming car. Peggy continued raising the family without Gwendolyn. One does not think of a duck as road kill. I still don\u2019t think of Gwendolyn in that light. But, such is the way of nature.

But there are other ways. I would mention the adulation of the US military which reminds me of the veneration of \"His Imperial Majesty's Soldiers and Sailors\" in Japan during the Pacific War, which is the very antithesis of the role of the armed forces in a democratic society. Nowadays, anyone who dares criticize the military in any way is likely to be called a traitor, shouted down, mostly on the right but also sometimes by liberals. This is a very unhealthy situation.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I watched \"You'll never get rich\" on TV, with Phil Silvers playing the larcenous Sgt. Bilko. Back in the 1950s, so many men had served in our old democratic armies, fighting in World War II and Korea, that audiences could easily identify with the antics of the Sergeant and his slapstick motor pool. But today, anything like \"You'll never get rich\" would be condemned as a slur on our \"heroes.\" <br/><br/>On top of the tendency to venerate the military is the view of war as a kind of spectator sport, eagerly exploited by Hollywood. With computer graphics, blowing away terrorists can be fun. It's sad to me to see kids in my suburban neighborhood running around in camouflage, carrying plastic M-16 replicas.

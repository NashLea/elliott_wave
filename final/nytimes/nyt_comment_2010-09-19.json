A wave of political correctness (enforced by death threats from the radical fringe of Islam, and dutifully relayed by the highest echelons of our government) has stifled free speech where it relates to that religion, working to insulate it from the insults to which Christianity and Judaism have long been subject in this country.<br /><br />For as long as I can recall, Christians and Jews have had to take gut punches from seemingly every quarter, including Hollywood, the artistic community, outspoken atheists, and the news media -- all in the interest of \"artistic license,\" intellectual fashion and, of course, general free speech.  Suffer these we surely have, sometimes under protest, but always peacefully and with an understanding of the benefits and burdens of free speech.  The Last Temptation of Christ, Salieri's fireplace burning of a crucifix in Amadeus, and  Serrano's \"P*ss Christ\" come immediately to mind, and there are countless other examples as I'm sure you well know.  The disparate treatment of Christianity and Judaism on the one hand, and Islam on the other, is at least partially accounted for by the fact that Hollywood has never been threatened with obliteration by a Christian mob, and no \"blasphemer\" against Christianity has ever had to go into FBI protective custody under threat of fatwa.  Nor should they be.<br /><br />As one of this nation's core values, the constitutional right to free speech, and perhaps especially to offensive free speech (since inoffensive speech needs no constitutional protection), must be defended at all costs.  Constitutionally protected free speech includes the right to express hatred, as long as the expression does not include or imply a threat.  On the other hand, there is no constitutional right not to have your feelings hurt.  This means that, in the United States, one is legally permitted to demean Islam, burn Korans, draw Mohammed, and so on, without fear of violent retribution.

I myself would not do these things, but in this country even the hateful and the offensive have a right to speak.

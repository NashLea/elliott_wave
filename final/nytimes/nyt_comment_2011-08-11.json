There were several (unintentionally, I'm sure) funny bits. The movie shows that Adria considers his creations more art than food (he does tell an interviewer that taste comes last), so we don't really need to taste or smell his dishes or even watch restaurant patrons eat. That, and who Adria really is, is for another movie. Meanwhile, if you're curious about molecular gastronomy and want to watch its practitioners at work, don't miss this film.

For a brightly lit office, kitchen, or bathroom, the best lighting is cool white or daylight (4100K-6500K).  For a dimly lit dining room, the best lighting is very warm 2200K-2700K.<br/><br/>2) Most LED lamps have a very efficient blue-violet LED source covered by a phosphor cap that converts some of the blue to other colors.  The cheapest LED lamps have an orange phosphor.  More expensive lamps have better phosphors to give a more balanced spectrum.  The choice of phosphors is the biggest cause for poor color rendering.  Companies are developing quantum-dot phosphors which will soon (mid 2012) make really nice phosphors.  Some premium LED lamps you can buy today have RGB sources inside which give perfect color rendering.<br/><br/>3) A better way for government to promote LED technology would be to push it on businesses first.  In particular, it ought to be pushed on restaurants.  It's hard to find a restaurant today that doesn't use arrays of wasteful incandescent lamps.  These are ideal places to retrofit with high-quality CFL and LED lamps.  Restaurants are usually air-conditioned, have several identical fixtures, are lit 12 hours a day, and are high-profile locations.  They are perfect places to showcase LED lighting.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 1106010, "replies": [], "lft": 42, "assetURL": "http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/460792/Catfish/overview", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4327809, "rgt": 43, "userDisplayName": "mk", "createDate": "1313033161", "userID": 16010210, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "compelling", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1313036478", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "florida", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1313032878", "commentSequence": 21, "commentBody": ".. a compelling documentary about a compelling person; too much nev; not enough angela.    the dvd has an interesting interview with the directors at the end, which supports much of the above critiques.   still, i was thoroughly interested in this.  i just wish the focus was less on the compelling draw of flattery and flirtation, and instead the motivations, and especially the afterthoughts (no where included) of the disturbed and sympathetic artist at the film's core.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3086774, "replies": [], "lft": 422, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/us/11housing.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4327918, "rgt": 423, "userDisplayName": "T.", "createDate": "1313035946", "userID": 42326024, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1313036598", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1313032998", "commentSequence": 178, "commentBody": "There apparently are some people who use Section 8 vouchers appropriately (disabled persons) but my personal experience with it is as described in most posts:  loud, foul music; garbage; lots of kids unsupervised; abusive and negligent parents; animal neglect; drugs; pure squalor and laziness. I am completely opposed to Section 8 because of my experiences.  Aside from a permanently disabled person, who could possibly be in need for 10 consecutive years - long enough to wait on the waiting list?  I met one woman who has been in subsidized housing for 13 years but her kids were 10 and 8.  This means she CHOSE to have two MORE kids knowing full well that she wasn't supporting herself.  I have no sympathy for these free-loaders.  As far as domestic violence victims, I feel for them.  However my experience in Legal Aid is that most women just go from one abusive relationship to another and they bring those crazy neanderthals with them wherever they go.  I had more sympathy for the women until I got to know their stories intimately.  Very often the women have some pretty big problems themselves (alcohol, drugs) that distort their decision-making process.  We must screen Section 8 to protect the disabled and rid ourselves of people who put themselves in hell with horrible choices.  All they do is drag you down to hell with them.

It's saddening that housing advocates choose to sue cities, instead of addressing the serious problems within the Section 8 program.<br/>\n.<br/>\nSection 8 has no requirements for habitability, beyond simply meeting local building codes.  As a result, slum lords often view the vouchers as free money.  They don't screen tenants the way they should, so not only is the housing substandard, it's crime ridden.<br/>\n.<br/>\nIn fact, in 1986 the Federal Government saw these problems and created Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC).  LIHTC landlords get tax breaks in return for setting aside a percentage of their units for low-income tenants.  They are required to accept Section 8 vouchers, but they also have to meet very strict requirements for habitability and safety.  LIHTC housing tends to be good quality, and relatively crime free; in marked contrast to housing that just gets Section 8 vouchers.<br/>\n.<br/>\nIf housing advocates really wanted quality housing for the poor, they'd do something about the inherent problems in the Section 8 program.

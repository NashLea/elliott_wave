Finally, he noticed the word OVERLORD and concluded these were no coincidences but maybe a way of signaling the Germans of the planned invasion. British Intelligence interviewed the professor responsible for the crossword puzzles. He taught at a school where much of the staging for the invasion was located. The professor denied any knowledge or being a German spy. It turned out that he had given grids to his students and asked them to create crossword puzzles. Later it was learned that the young student who created the crossword puzzles had heard these three words and decided to include them, not knowing their significance.

Of course Trump is only a symptom, but of what? The political parties are reflections of the soul of a democracy's electorate. That is what needs to be examined.

What has Republican leadership wrought since 2008 and then 2012?--especially 2012. Or, indeed, where does it begin, because I think you are spot on when you say, \"...the primary vibe from the G.O.P. has become one of indiscriminate, unthinking, all-consuming anger.\" That's a little crude. For accuracy's sake you could say 'The soul of the G.O.P. has become one of indiscriminate, unthinking, all-consuming anger:'<br/>\"the soul\" as in, the unifying force that drives the Republican Party. Can that be in the Republican electorate, but not the in leadership? Paul Ryan, for example, whom you admire, does that characterize him?<br/><br/>No, but something is very wrong with Mr. Ryan and all the others in a similar position in the Republican leadership, that is, if you are right about Trump and the Republican Party. Because they all support Trump for president. What's wrong with them Mr. Boot? You're the conservative intellectual, you and George Will and others. What is it?<br/><br/>What is going on?

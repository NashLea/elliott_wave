(Considering how many powerful, rich alumni tend to have been 'Greeks', that would probably do their career prospects almost as much good as a murder rap.) So the frats got away with everything, as long as they could prevent pledges from winding up in the ER or the morgue, until this one got caught out at some very 'politically incorrect' (not to mention just plain nauseatingly racist) behaviour.<br/>Don't expect radical changes from this little episode. One frat's out and another one will eventually come in, perhaps a 'minority' one (Complete with all the traditional hazing, money-grubbing conformity and enforced groupthink typical of the lot of them, members' skin pigmentation variations notwithstanding.)

Let's just look at economics to see why inequality is bad.<br/><br/>Experiments are hard to come by in economics, but we have a couple in the US to look at since WWI. There have been two medium long periods of very high inequality (Gini about 0.5), the 1920's and the 2000's. Both led to periods of disastrous economics, On the other hand, there was the long period of 1946 - 1973 (Gini about 0.25) which was a period of great prosperity. Since I do not place much faith in any economic theory, this evidence makes me believe that high inequality is very bad for the country.<br/><br/>But I know people like explanations. The want to know why. So I'll give it a shot.<br/><br/>1. Inequality depresses demand. A non-rich person must spend a greater percentage of his income to live than a Rich one. When many people are out of work, or are underpaid, when inequality is high, the non-rich do not have enough money to buy the stuff they need or want. They may want a new car, but they cannot afford it. This means businesses are not expanding because they do not have enough customers. You cannot create demand out of thin air. It requires getting money to people to spend it.<br/><br/>2. Inequality encourages financial speculation. What do the Rich do when they have so much money they cannot remember how many houses they own? They speculate with it.

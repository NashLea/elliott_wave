As a single mom by choice, it was a very easy call for me to be open about the use of a donor, and my son has been told this story from the time he was an infant.  Although I won't predict the future, at 6, he is comfortable with the knowledge that he has a donor rather than a dad, and has not expressed any interest in finding out more about the donor.   At age 18, he will have that opportunity as the donor \"open identity\" which means he has agreed to keep the sperm bank aware of his whereabouts, and he has agreed that his information can be released to the children conceived with his sperm, once they turn 18.<br /><br />I personally find it repugnant that a parent who conceived with the use of donor gametes would keep that fact hidden from their children.  However, despite my eternal gratitude towards my son's donor, I do not consider him my son's father in any other sense than genetic, and I do not feel that the egg donor here is acting appropriately in her desire to initiate contact and create some form of \"mother-child relationship.\"  I am obviously less threatened as a mother than a mother via egg donation would be, but beyond that, I subscribe to the idea that a parent is the person who raises the child, who is there for the milestone both large and small, and all the tears and smiles.  However, I am also prepared to respect the decisions of my son and if he ultimately makes contact with his donor and assigns some type of fatherhood to him, I will come to terms with that decision.  But the big difference to me is that it would be my son's decision to seek out the donor, and his own opinions that will factor in to the nature of any relationship they may have.  I am concerned that despite my personal feelings about the choice the donee mother may have made to keep this hidden from the twins, I don't feel that the donor should initiate contact, particularly not with some pre-conceived idea in her mind that it would be in furtherance of a \"mother-child relationship.\"<br /><br />However, I also believe that just as adoption used to often be kept hidden in the past, until adoptive children demanded and fought for the ability to make contact with their biological parents, I firmly feel that donor conceived children will make that same journey and fight that same battle and reach the same outcome.  And I think that will be better for all involved - the donors, the donee parents and most importantly, the donor conceived children.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2279081, "replies": [], "lft": 54, "assetURL": "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/an-egg-donors-tale/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3209859, "rgt": 55, "userDisplayName": "MB", "createDate": "1294722497", "userID": 47511968, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294722608", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "St. Paul, MN", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294722608", "commentSequence": 25, "commentBody": "Thank you for a beautiful, reflective post -- certainly not one that aims to speak for egg donors as a group but a necessary addition to the discussion.<br /><br />The first person to respond mentioned a study by a conservative group on offspring of donor gametes.  There's also a post by lesbian mom blogger extraordinaire, Mombian, which cite more objective studies on the same topic (in the journal Human Reproduction); see <a href=\"http://www.mombian.com/2011/01/06/known-or-unknown-donors-the-kids-are-all-right-either-way-study-shows/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mombian.com...</a>.<br /><br />Like some others who wrote in, I find the secrecy of the intended parents in the above story a pity (for the children, who deserve not to have this information be kept from them).  As a lesbian mom, I also see this desire as rooted in the matrix of the parents' \"straight privilege.\"  I don't have the option of passing off my kids as the biological product solely of my partner and me , and I wonder why intended (straight) parents would feel such an urgent need to cover up the existence of third or fourth parties in their story.  I found this one aspect of Thernstrom's article very lovely (perhaps a little utopian):  the understanding that unassisted reproduction is not metaphysically \"better\" than assisted reproduction (though it's definitely cheaper, and more straightforward).<br /><br />All this having been said, I also agree that although the donee couple are misguided to lie about their kids' biological origins, the donor should not spring this information on the kids.  Hopefully the donees will have done some reflecting or will at least think the medical information is pertinent.

I'm unaware of any actual act of violence this person ever committed (beyond slamming an office door in my face so hard it nearly ripped it off its hinges), but his behavior toward me and several others made it absolutely clear that placing a deadly weapon in his hands would be a recipe for disaster. NRA persists in the fantasy that official criminal convictions and official admissions to psychiatric confinement can serve as standards for weeding out lunatics who apply for approval of gun purchases or carry permits. This is the height of naive nonsense.<br /><br />Considering Columbine, Virginia Tech, and now this latest sorrowful episode of \"legitimate\" gun owners gone berserk, we desperately need a contact point where persons observing bizarre behavior in a potential mass-murder perpetrator can alert law enforcement authorities and set in motion an investigation that can stave off a looming tragedy.<br /><br />There need to be safeguards to prevent the usual big-city politicians, police officials or others with a blatant anti-gun agenda from abusing such legal apparatus to prevent sane and properly qualified individuals from acquiring and keeping small arms for personal protection, but these aren't inconsistent with reasonable measures to minimize threats to prominent figures and the public at large.<br /><br />We put deadly weapons in the hands of peace officers and licensed private citizens every day, almost always with good results that enhance public safety.

I blame the post columbine rule which installed a zero tolerance policy on perceived threats/dangers posed by students on themselves and others. In my daughters case, in 7th grade, she was overheard to have said 'suicide' by someone. This someone reported the incident to her teacher who immediately sent her to nurses office and called me, to pick her up and gave me notice that she will not be accepted back unless with a letter from a mental health professional certifying that she is not a danger to herself and/or others.<br /><br />If it sounds familiar, this is the same notice, the assassin received from the community college. As for me, I immediately took my daughter to ER where the 1st thing I was made to do, was to agree on the mental health professional's fee, $500/hour. I agreed and got a letter and my daughter was back at school the next day. Not before warning her to be careful with her words.<br /><br />The assassin was not that lucky. He did not get a clearance letter, I do not know why.

Since they knew this danger, shouldn't they be held accountable for their inaction ?<br /><br />The problem with the zero-tolerance policy is its a zero-sum game that can be self-fulfilling in its outcome. There is no opportunity to question the accuser. Context does not matter ! What matters is a red-flag was raised by someone/anyone and action needs to be taken on the accused.

They sadly were there, possibly only to watch a \"news\" event.  Instead they became news.<br />   And that may point a finger to the problem.  Events -- rallies, protests, press conferences, etc. -- can be attractive morsels on the menu.  Media assignment editors, particularly television, can fill in a spot on a newscast with something that combines people, placards, and occasionally substance.  Politicians love the event because they get their faces on the screen or front page, and typically there isn't much cost expended to accomplish it.<br />    In most cases, however, there is no real news that results from such events.  But it fills a spot, keeps the media in a politicians mind when campaign ad budgets are appropriated, and generally causes no more harm than it does good.  Such events rarely inform the populace, but then most don't vote so what does it matter.<br />    I believe the over-covering of typical events weakens the news.  It substitutes quantity for quality, and it becomes show business.  That's right, the business of the people -- its government -- becomes entertainment.<br />    I frankly wonder why network news organizations had to dispatch teams of celebrity reporters and anchors to Tucson to report on a story that could be as effectively reported from New York or Washington with  feeds from local/regional sources.  I think it has been grandstanding.<br />    Those bent on going down in history in a hail of police bullets or in satisfying their twisted appetites through a horrendous orgy of violence aren't too much different than politicians.  Both want news coverage, and they will do anything to get it.<br />     The argument goes that the people need to have access to their political leaders, and that such events provide access.  That is a stretch.  Everyone knows that a check book provides access.<br />     If the media were more selective on what it covers, politicians and fruitcakes possibly would be less inclined to stage media events whenever the urge appears.  This may provide less material for the uninformed commentators proliferating media outlets to use spew out misinformation in order to arouse emotions within their listeners and readers so that ratings -- and salaries -- soar.  It always struck me that all-news radio outlets offer little real news.<br />    Once news organizations enhance their news connoisseurship, then perhaps the toxic rhetoric will recede; but, until that happens, it will just increase.  It seems our leaders and their handlers don't want know how to work any other way. They covet the spotlight.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2275839, "replies": [], "lft": 1452, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/us/11giffords.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3209693, "rgt": 1453, "userDisplayName": "jeanne", "createDate": "1294718863", "userID": 56182382, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1294724894", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "MA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1294755900", "commentSequence": 528, "commentBody": "If Congress and state governments will not pass sane laws about guns or ammunition that are only used to kill large amounts of people, maybe we should name the manufacturers and places where the ammo is sold and have a national boycott.

As a realist, though, I recognize that there is little or no chance for any effective legislation establishing handgun controls that would protect all Americans (and not just those elected to Congress).  Why not, though, let gun owners pay for the consequences of freely available handguns by imposing a national tax on gun sales to support, for example, increased security costs for members of Congress or medical and compensation funds for the victims of gun violence?

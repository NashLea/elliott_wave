DRGs include a certain number of days of inpatient care as part of the flat rate payment. The sooner a patient is discharged the better the hospital makes out financially, freeing a bed for another admission and another case rate payment. Medicare has to an extent addressed this perverse incentive by docking hospitals' payments when they execute a 'quick and sick' discharge to a skilled nursing facility as opposed to keeping the patient a day or two longer and discharging home with home health care. It's all a game of sorts.

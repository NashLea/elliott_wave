Pearson is the world\u2019s largest education company and book publisher, bringing in more than $9 billion annually.<br/><br/>Currently, Pearson has partnered with 18 states in the U.S., as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, to produce pricey testing materials. For a five-year contract, Pearson was paid $32 million to produce standardized tests for New York. Its contract in Texas was worth $500 million. Pearson also owns Connections Academy, a company that runs for-profit, virtual charter schools. It also owns the GED program, although competitors have been creating alternatives in order to combat Pearson\u2019s expensive tests. By and large, the massive corporation has far-reaching control over the education industry.<br/><br/>In Texas a Pearson employee was on the ballot for a School Board election, and lost.

The Pearson tests, given to 8-13 y.o. students over 6 days and 7 hours, result in a score between 1 and 4, given to teachers after the school year ends. There's no granularity/utility to the data. The tests do what they're meant to-- close schools &amp; fire teachers so Cuomo can look like a reformer.<br/><br/>NY teachers now have 50% of their evaluation turn on \"Value Added Measures\"-- roughly how much their students improve year over year. The American Statistical Association says teachers are responsible for 1-14% of a student's test performance, yet those teachers whose students don't improve, even by a tiny margin, cannot be rated above \"developing.\" English Language Learners and kids with IEPs take the tests too. Art, Science, and Music teachers are (somehow) also rated by these VAMs. Passing scores are determined after results are in. Teachers and administrators risk censure for even VIEWING the tests, let alone criticizing them. <br/><br/>The practical effects of this arbitrary system of evaluation are what's driving PARENT dissatisfaction: a narrowing of the curriculum felt most acutely at low-performing schools &amp; the demoralizing effect of that loss of creativity and autonomy on students and teachers. 12 years of NCLB tests and the \"achievement gap\" hasn't closed-- will these do the trick?

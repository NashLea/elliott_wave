And with apologies to DHM, the lonely LONGHORN somewhere in New Jersey, I will try to overcome my annual early October typing tic and capitalize appropriately.  (The fact that it has been known to irritate the occasional LONGHORN mitigates its lameness.)<br/><br/>There is no setting in college football that comes close to the OU-TEXAS game.  Yes, the Cotton Bowl is a relic, but she has a classic beauty that only comes with age.  It has a great facade.  And it's loud.  And from the upper deck of the east side of the stadium you can see the Dallas skyline to your right and the Ferris wheel and the crazy, whirling rides of the State Fair to your left.  Fantastic.<br/><br/>The cacophonous carnival atmosphere surrounding the stadium is impossible to beat.<br/><br/>And then there's the tunnel.  I was a poor college student in the '80s who could have never afforded a season ticket, let alone a trip to every away game, so I polished up my trumpet and tried out for the band.  Best decision I ever made.  Ringside seat, all expenses paid.  Going down that tunnel before the game and walking out onto the field and seeing (and hearing) the strange spectacle of a stadium divided exactly in half is something I'll never forget.<br/><br/>And so I am stuck on this game, exactly as it is, for as long as it can last.  That's one reason I was so torn over OU's dalliance with the Pac-12.  Moving to a different conference wouldn't solve anything.  It wouldn't make us hate TEXAS any less and it might take away our yearly chance to pound in their faces.  Where's the fun in that?<br/><br/>And as for moving the game out to JerryWorld?  Please. That's like moving Christmas to July due to compelling evidence that summer vacation and favorable weather would make for an even bigger economic bonanza.<br/><br/>Leave OU-TEXAS alone.

Americans have demanded from the government to warn us and be on alert for such action, as well as do what it takes to prevent it. <br/><br/>The question is what price must we pay to have this guarantee of protection?  <br/><br/>Unfortunately we never had this true discussion or debate in this country after 2011...and we are not having it now.  Instead we have accepted that the government will,and should do, all it can do to protect us from harm from another attack. <br/><br/>At the same time, many want the government honor the traditions of Am. liberty, which is fine.  But how do you actually do that waging a war against a tactic, such as terrorism?  <br/><br/>Again, I am not siding with the Obama administration, but asking people to be honest with themselves.  What price are you willing to pay to be safe?  <br/><br/>In the abstract you can say that liberty forever is your cause, but when actual harm is about to hit you or kill you and your family, are truly ready and able to hide behind the abstract.<br/><br/>Are you guys an atheist in practice or you guys the type of atheist who, when harm approaches, call on a higher power, God, to protect him or her. <br/><br/>The outrage on this site is one level deep, because if harm approaches them, I will bet my entire fortune that nearly 100% of the people who oppose this action will be screaming for protection. <br/><br/>Liberty and the pursuit of happiness has made this country great...but this is an abstract concept that bonds us together, not protect us from physical harm.<br/><br/>I hope very soon that we, as Americans, can begin to debate what our government should do to protect us from harm.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 3285002, "replies": [], "lft": 562, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/middleeast/secret-us-memo-made-legal-case-to-kill-a-citizen.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4664534, "rgt": 563, "userDisplayName": "Dave K", "createDate": "1318133062", "userID": 57566172, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1318133750", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1318130150", "commentSequence": 254, "commentBody": "There is no room for legal debate.

Instead, we're all supposed to hear the evidence that the executive branch has that this person is a Bad Person, and a jury of citizens gets to decide whether they're right.<br/><br/>If the Obama administration had wanted to, they could have worked with the Yemeni government (an ally of the US) to attempt to arrest Al-Awlaki. If he had resisted arrest, then by all means use force to take him down. If not, then they could bring him back to the US, and tell a jury about all the bad things he did. And if he was that bad, then there should be no problem obtaining a conviction.

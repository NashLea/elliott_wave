It's this perception of \"America's Exceptionalism\" that I find to be the problem.  Maybe Pres. Obama realizes that when the USA forays blindly into the much and mess of others, there's not really a heck of a lot that can be done other than spend trillions more while we grow only the Veterans Administration. Our Exceptionalism removed an anchor dictator in Iraq and created a sectarian war and gave Iraq to Iran. We flinched when Egypt democratically elected Morisi and stood by as General Sisi essentially replaced Mubarak.   Obviously, a decision preferred by Israel and Liberty be damned.<br/><br/>Syria has basically been a mess since the end of WW1 when the Middle East was carved up by Sykes-Picot as the spoils of war to the French and British.

There is overwhelming evidence that humans wiped out an immense fauna of large mammals when they arrived in North America perhaps 15,000 years ago, 34 genera of elephants, horses, camels, rhinos, giant ground sloths, bison, etc., and the great carnivores that preyed upon them.  Once humans left Africa, they eradicated large  wildlife wherever they arrived, slower in the case of Eurasia where we expanded in numbers slowly, very rapidly in North and South America, Australia and innumerable oceanic islands, where prey were naive to human hunting.   We are witness to the final stages of a long extinction that started when man became a capable hunter.  Romantic notions of hunter-gatherers as natural conservationists make a pretty story, but it is wholly untrue."}]}, "lft": 152, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/opinion/our-deadened-carbon-soaked-seas.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 16381438, "rgt": 155, "userDisplayName": "David Gregory", "createDate": "1444952275", "userID": 30006326, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1444968362", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Deep Red South", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1444964762", "commentSequence": 16381438, "commentBody": "It is more than obvious that the political process will do almost nothing but pose and talk until the wolf is literally at the door relative to the environment.

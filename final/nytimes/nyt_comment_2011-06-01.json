Kasputys...<br/><br/>A somewhat innocuous statement with a deceptively incorrect conclusion.  In fact, those House Republicans were elected by a majority of voters in their districts - not \"Republicans more to the right.\"  The message is much more broadly felt and sent than implied by this poorly reasoned, simplistic comment.<br/><br/>In fact, the American people clearly understand that increasing the debt without changing the ways of government is folly.  Those who believe that not raising the debt is folly are correct to a point.  That point is a legally binding commitment to reduce spending.  If we must raise taxes (and I personally believe we should), any tax increase should touch 80-90% of households - even in a modest way for those of modest means.  <br/><br/>The binding force of our republic is our common destiny but that force and that destiny require a common sacrifice.  Without that shared commitment, the destiny of our nation is fated to be that of parochial and ineffective bickering (if we're not there already).", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2784256, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/follow-the-runway/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3903713, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Frankie", "createDate": "1306518985", "userID": 50316405, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1306900889", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1306897289", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "\"Isn\u2019t there another company out there with some new ideas to offer?\"  Well there are, they just are smaller lines, with GREAT ideas!  As a denim designer and owner of my own small denim line it is sad that large retailers do not ever pick up small lines that do amazing things.  As an independent designer without the ability to have a sales rep chum up the Bloomingdales buyer it is basically impossible to get buyers to even consider us.  So why not get a to rep the line?  There are a lot of bad sales reps that really will not do anything except collect rent fee, it has happened so back to the indie direction.  The point is smaller lines offer great incentives usually produced domestically, higher quality, and care in the design and innovation, that is what's so special about independent designers, we care so much and you can tell in the details.  Long story short, look for what's new, and give some support young new designers.

Quick recap: she's a Ivy League educated lawyer who also happens to have stylists and etiquette managers on hand. You, the commenters, do not. Not only was Mrs. Obama's outfits appropriate for each and every occasion, but very similar to how other royalty are dressed when meeting the Queen. <br/><br/>PS: You were a hat or a head covering to meet the Pope, not the Queen.

Unfortunately I don't think it is that simple.\r<br/><br/>As someone in my late 20's working for a luxury house in Paris, I often experience bouts of creative urgency which are then dampened by the harsh realities of how hard and how impossible it is to have a viable creative business these days. For me, I thought that working for a luxury house was the only viable avenue to (eventually) having a creative vision that was grounded is some kind of commercial reality. Now I'm not so sure - that idea stands to be tested.\r<br/><br/>I watch so many 'young designers' get creatively worn down by the commercial realities and the industry's hunger for a knock out collection every six months. So many of my friends in the industry, still in their twenties are already burnt out. Surely the pace of the industry has something to answer for? It feels like the spirit of fashion, that love, the whim and fantasy is dying. It feels like it is just turning into a big commercial grind, and I fear that if I ever take a chance to put myself out there, I will just get chewed up and spat out like the rest of them. All I see in front of me is a harsh battlefield.\r<br/><br/>I don't think you can blame a lack of creative urgency. Of course, you have to have that element there. You also have to remember that designers, by nature, are sensitive people, very few are born with a brash determination. I think you have to consider that, unfortunately, we are dealing with a very different world today than we ever have before.\r", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2792150, "replies": [], "lft": 104, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/world/africa/31guinea.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3919409, "rgt": 105, "userDisplayName": "operadog", "createDate": "1306899136", "userID": 17719192, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1306901348", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "fb", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1306897748", "commentSequence": 44, "commentBody": "The primary reason I no longer stand for the National Anthem.<br/>\nCarl, Portland", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

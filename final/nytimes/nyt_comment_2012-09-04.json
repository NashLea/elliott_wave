The man who should have been president did not get that opportunity essentially because he lost the black vote (i.e., a few hundred black Americans in Florida who didn't get to vote at all while one black American in Washington got to vote twice).  In any case, the very real accomplishments of the Clinton administration can be credited at least as much to Mr. Gore as they can to Mr. Clinton.  The fact that he was untouched by the President's proclivity to tempt the fates by inviting personal scandal didn't help him to avoid the problem of guilt by association.  Even so, he deserves to be remembered with fondness and admiration.  Had he not been robbed of his election victory in 2000, we would undoubtedly be well on our way to energy independence by now.

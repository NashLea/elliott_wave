Go single payer, as in Medicare for all, control costs and fees, put providers on salaries commensurate with their skills, training, output and quality, substitute a no-fault liability and/or honest, objective arbitration for the current med-mal system that benefits lawyers more than patients, and enact a fair progressive taxation system to cover the costs.

Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.\"<br/><br/>As another commenter wrote  the most serious concern here (at least to me and him) is whether Hillary breached her disclosure agreement with the Obama administration. If the quoted sentence is correct, it's hard not to conclude that she did. That question deserves a closer look. Beyond that, frankly, this strikes me as a lot of smoke (though I agree with many commenters that there is far more \"smoke\" surrounding Hillary Clinton than there ought to be). <br/><br/>I hope Hillary will explain why this #2.35 million donation wasn't disclosed.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3426985, "replies": [], "lft": 11, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html", "parentID": 14784830, "commentID": 14785498, "rgt": 12, "userDisplayName": "JFS", "createDate": "1429844011", "userID": 56805727, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1429848335", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Pittsburgh", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1429844735", "commentSequence": 14785498, "commentBody": "Not compatible with much further development in utero, even (let alone birth and survival after birth).

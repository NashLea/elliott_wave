Thousands of military men and women have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. No one has heard of them. But take a murder from the trailer park and suddenly everyone is watching 24/7. Nancy Grace is a national disGRACE - she pronounced the Duke LaCrosse team guilty as well, until the facts proved them innocent.

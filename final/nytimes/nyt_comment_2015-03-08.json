They eschew the responsibility to prepare teachers, nurses, and teaching undergraduates at all. It is the siren song enticing public universities to become \"elite\" that makes them vulnerable and creates antagonism in state legislatures.  Public higher education has a responsibility to its citizens and yet that mission seems to be of little interest to governing boards and university presidents. Reformation?  No. Let\u2019s return to the mission of public higher education: discover new knowledge, teach that knowledge to the citizens of the state (ALL citizens of the state as the 1890 Morrill Act requires), and ensure a populace that ready for the future.

The reality is, no player is hired or getting paid to play at UK. So there aren't any hired mercenaries, Sorry!  Calipari merely excels at recruiting talented players.  What he doesn't get credit for is being able to coach and mold these young players in such a fast paced fashion.  Keep in mind these players are young and are sharing minutes that most teams would not.  There isn't another coach out there that has been able to develop players on and off the court in that way.  What if Calipari had been here for 10 seasons or more, would your ideal about a legendary coach be different?  I would sure hope so.  Just because history is in the making and your short sited mind can't see that doesn't make it any less \"legendary\" or spectacular.  The other reality is while Kentucky fans love having their in-state players; winning is the most important thing.  I think any program would have the same mind set... they surely wouldn't be turning away the talent Calipari has been able to recruit and develop.  There's not a coach, AD, or fan in the country that wouldn't love to have the players Kentucky has been able to recruit.  The only thing that is laughable is your blatant ignorance and obvious hatred or discontent for the UK program.  Sandra I certainly don't see any negative undertones in this column.

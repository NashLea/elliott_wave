Clinical trials can be tricky. You need to consider - there are very many details that go wrong with any given clinical trial of an active drug such the results will appear to show that it is not effective. There is no way you can run a clinical with an inactive drug that will show the drug is effective. What that means is if you run ten clinical trials, and a drug shows activity in only one of the ten trials, the correct conclusion is that the drug is in fact active. Negative results from clinical trials do not cancel positive results, because you can't get a positive result unless it is real. This may be hard for the lay public to grasp, but it is never-the-less true. Further, I think you are mistaken when you say that negative results were not reported to the FDA, because absolutely everything you do with drug in clinical trial has to be reported to the FDA. I believe you are conflating fact that drug companies often do not report negative not report results to journal publications, which is a very different thing. If you make 100 mistakes you don't publish your mistakes; what you do publish is - if you run the trial in this specific way, this is the result you will get. The implication is, that if you run the trail in very same way again, you will get the same result.

The west, especially Europe, is so divided, its member states so pettily selfish, its leaders so preoccupied with being reelected, that it can't even agree on how to implement other tools in their disposal, especially extremely severe economic sanctions which will break Russia's will for expansionism. What has been done so far is pathetic.<br/><br/>Considering the European system which requires consensus by all countries, even a beggar of a country like Greece who now elected a leftist government who, for some unfathomable reason, feels close to Russia, can derail any decision. When you have a bunch of selfish, divided cowards facing Putin, you can be sure whose interest will prevail when the dust settle down."}]}, "lft": 348, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/world/europe/ukraine-fighting-escalates-ahead-of-truce.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 14134430, "rgt": 353, "userDisplayName": "Thomas W.", "createDate": "1423888883", "userID": 60572928, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1423890148", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "San Diego", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1423890148", "commentSequence": 14134430, "commentBody": "Let's be totally honest here.

Many public sector jobs have no direct private sector counterparts. To use just one position as an example,  I would say that many experienced teachers, of whom there are millions, make as much income on an annualized basis as a low-to-mid-level manager. If these teachers were to leave the profession and enter the private sector, most would not be able to replace their teachers' salaries and benefits, even in good economic times. That is not to say that they are overpaid, but simply to say that the jobs for which they would be qualified, considering the ratio of managers to employees, in the private sector would probably not pay as well.<br /><br />Public employees whose employment is not covered by Social Security often pay a percentage of their income toward their pension plan; however, unlike Social Security participants having like income, they are not expected to subsidize the retirements of persons earning much less than themselves.<br /><br />These public pension funding shortfalls have come to light as a result of accounting changes, but they have existed for some time nevertheless. They were simply masked by accounting standards that allowed the use of greatly exaggerated future investment earnings assumptions, the effect of which has been magnified by today's extremely low interest and discount rates, coupled with relaxed funding requirements. Government and church pension plans have for too long been exempt from the strict regulations to which private pension plans are subject. Church plan rules have been so lax that many nonprofit employers having even a nominal connection to a religious group have declared their plans church plans, with disastrous results for the plan participants.<br /><br />Public sector employees will have to make some compromises, just as private sector employees have. Some of the excess in public pensions could be trimmed if automatic benefit increases were to be eliminated in favor of true cost-of-living allowances, but if retirees resist these and other necessary cost-curtailment measures, their successors, whose work is just as difficult and just as important, will pay the price, through some combination of steep reductions in promised benefits, lower salaries, increased employee contributions to pension plans, or increased service requirements. To assert that one has earned an overly generous pension as a result of dedication to a public service career, even as its requirement of ever-increasing payments will almost certainly result in our inability to provide adequately for the retirement needs of the equally dedicated public servants who follow, is both hypocritical and unfair.<br />", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 1725555, "replies": [], "lft": 494, "assetURL": "http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/who-should-pay-for-the-trillion-dollar-pension-gap/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2362845, "rgt": 495, "userDisplayName": "JenofNJ", "createDate": "1281153273", "userID": 57616156, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281154082", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1281150482", "commentSequence": 225, "commentBody": "Why on earth do public sector workers get pensions when the rest of us get nothing or 401(k) plans that vaporize with a market downturn?

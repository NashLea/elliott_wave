From Europe you come back over Greenland, of all places. To East Asia you fly over Alaska. These are great ciricle routes. (When going the opposite direction, flights follow more of a straight line route, in part because of the jet stream, which blows at about 300mph from west to east over the oceans at mid latitudes and very high altitudes: despite taking a longer route, the time in the air is usually an hour less because of the greater speed). <br/><br/>So a train route through Alaska is not as silly as it seems.

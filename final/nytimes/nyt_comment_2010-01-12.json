So why keep the lies going all this time? He lied, and wants to be forgiven. He lied to his family, friends and fans. What message does that tell? Keep the lie going, but when you do come clean things will be ok? NO! He ruined a magical year (1998). Instead of that year being the season that got fans back into the game, it's the year that made the world aware of steroids.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 13}, {"assetID": 1044026, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/sports/baseball/12sandomir.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1400216, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "Ross Williams", "createDate": "1263272689", "userID": 1694096, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1263272897", "userTitle": "", "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "", "userLocation": "Minnesota", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1263309257", "commentSequence": 32, "commentBody": "When does Jose Canseco get an apology from both McGwire and Tony Larussa and the Oakland coaches.

I attended may A's games in which I saw Mark hit LINE DRIVES over the fence.  Mark was my favorite player, and I was amazed by his talent.  Then he left Oakland, and everything changed.<br /><br />I feel for Mark as a human being, but as a former fan, I feel cheated.  It it because of players like Mark that I no longer watch baseball, and have an overall disdain for professional athletes.  As many other have said, I think his records should be nullified, and he should not be voted into the hall.<br /><br />Having said all of this, let us remember that we all make mistakes.  We have all done wrong at various points in our lives.  I know of no one that is without sin and regret.  Mark was a great player, hands down.  It's a shame that he ruined his otherwise good name by cheating, but what's done is done.  I hope that by admitting to his usage, Mark can begin to forgive himself, and move on with his life.", "recommendationCount": 1}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Individual companies can only pay so well, provide a certain amount of benefits, achieve a certain level of environmental responsibility, etc. before some competitor will see an opening to undercut them on prices by doing less good.  As such, doing good may work for a subset of niche industries (like coffee shops) or niche companies (like Ben &amp; Jerry's), but it simply cannot work on a large scale. <br/><br/>The simple fact is that the free market system virtually ensures that corporations will be amoral, as they have to do what they can to make a profit. That is why the way to achieve good is not by counting on corporations, but instead by using government to achieve higher wages, access to health insurance, environmental protection, etc. By having government set and enforce rules on these and other issues, companies less interested in doing good cannot undercut those interested who would like to do good.  <br/><br/>So it is nice that Starbucks wants to do some good. But it won't solve our problems, and we have to make sure it does not distract us from the need to ensure that government establishes the rules and policies needed to improve society. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 444}, {"assetID": 3311631, "replies": [], "lft": 568, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/world/asia/bain-capital-tied-to-surveillance-push-in-china.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5766723, "rgt": 569, "userDisplayName": "Theo Horesh", "createDate": "1331923405", "userID": 56845033, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1331956884", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boulder", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1331953284", "commentSequence": 113, "commentBody": "Of course Romney could have influenced this decision.

And the Afghanis who fight on \"our side\", whose fighting skills at one time matched the Taliban, have had those skills neutered by literally years now of Special Forces training. From the start we should should have just given the remaining members of the NA the best weapons to fight with and sent them out. Instead we felt we had the time and the right to reinvent them.

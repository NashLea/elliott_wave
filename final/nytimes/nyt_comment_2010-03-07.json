With all the zeros, billions and trillions flying around it is easy to lose perspective, but you have your percentages off by a factor of 10.  What is a factor of ten or a billion or $100,000,000 mean in the big picture anyway?  As I said above, it is not real money, it is only taxpayer money.  We can always print or tax away more.<br /><br />It would seem that you consider the loss of $500,000,000 from fraud in one year, in one city through only one fraudulent vehicle to be an acceptable loss.  I admit that I never heard that argument before.  Perhaps you could write that up and get other advocates of the Senate plan to use that as one of their talking points when promoting their position.  That would be very helpful to everyone.<br /><br />Disappointed, #18 above makes an excellent point about the title and the short summary for Professor Reinhardt's essay.  The professor's essay doesn't actually say anywhere that the fraud losses in health care are small.  He observes only that he doesn't believe fraud on a substantial scale occurs in major hospitals.  He is surely correct about that, but he never extrapolates that thesis to health care overall, no matter what the subtitle says.  I am going to go out on another limb and guess that Professor Reinhardt, makes no such extrapolation and that he  knows better.  He will surely saw one of these limbs off in a post one day, but I will take my chances until then.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1059220, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/how-long-have-you-been-at-your-job-if-you-have-one/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1659493, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "George Dawson", "createDate": "1267850491", "userID": 32424693, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267938112", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "North Carolina", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267938102", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "In 1974 I joined the USPS.

The revenue and expense sides aren't that closely coupled.  They're not cost-plus contracts, in other words.  How much they can collect is limited by the marketplace (assuming there is a functioning one), and expenses are determined by negotiated rates and contract terms.  They can't just pass on additional costs without being at a competitive disadvantage.<br /><br />I think the opposite is true of public sector programs.

Examine what I am saying close and consider for a moment that in 1969 an outpatient self prescribed vasectomy with your family doctor cost $300.00 to $600.00 and in 2009 the same self prescribed procedure will cost you $500.00 to $800.00. Now ask yourself, why hasn\u2019t the cost of this procedure skyrocketed, as in the costs of a root canal and crown on a molar for example? The root canal and molar costs ranged from about $100.00 to $200.00 in 1969 and now in 2010 the cost ranges from $1500.00 to $3000.00. Hmmm\u2026\u2026.is there an explanation?<br />The reason I used this example is very important, they are medical procedures that have gone through very little change for the most part, and are generally self prescribed. The changes that have been made in my examples have decreased the actual surgical times by almost 75% for both procedures; allowed doctors too perform the procedures at the office thereby reducing staff by nearly half and with improvements to local anesthesia the doctor rarely has to make his patient incoherent. These are all examples of change that make the procedures more efficient for both the doctor and the patient, yet the dental costs have risen nearly 21 times higher.<br /> From 1969 to present, what was the basic change between these two examples? If you hadn\u2019t already known or guessed it at this point, it\u2019s the way we pay for the two procedures!  In 1969 it was extremely rare for a vasectomy to be covered under an insurance plan and even rarer if at all, that a root canal and crown were included in a dental plan, that is if you could find a dental plan, the patient was required to pay for it out of pocket. To this day the vasectomy procedures are rarely covered under insurance plans, but root canals and crowns are; thereby keeping the vasectomy cost in check but allowing for rogue casino\u2019s (insurance companies) to give the doctors a big payout on the root canals and crowns; then slowly and steadily recouping the payouts with an increase in patient premiums, deductibles, and other shared costs that are unpleasantly similar to the slot machine formulas used in gambling institutions.<br />In the end, whether you think the method should be to rely on the \u201cgovernment to pay\u201d or the \u201cbig private industry to pay\u201d as if there is a noticeable difference between the two, the reality is either way, costs will continue to unjustifiably rise! Truthfully I have not found any form of commerce, that when free and liberated citizens relinquished and traded off (depending on insurance policies and bank loans) their responsibility rather than save their money and pay a vendor directly and in full, that the costs of products and services they were trying to get didn\u2019t quickly rise disproportionately.  The example that I gave above is only one of hundreds upon hundreds.<br />The way that the majority of people pay for health care (and many other goods and services) is fundamentally unproductive and deprecating to its core; just as an onion is an onion all the way to its middle. To what end do we continue to believe and buy into the fact that the onions (the hundreds and hundreds of different bank loans and insurance programs) we are being sold by the onion farmers (big government and the banking cartels) are apples.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1226696, "replies": [], "lft": 82, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/how-much-fraud-and-abuse-is-there-in-u-s-health-care/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1662060, "rgt": 83, "userDisplayName": "Nik", "createDate": "1267926547", "userID": 55785149, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267938561", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Canada", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267938561", "commentSequence": 39, "commentBody": "OH MY GOODNESS!!!

My eyes are literally bleeding.<br /><br />I don't know about your situation with the lump under your arm. I don't know what it felt like, and I'm not an MD yet. BUT (this is a HUGE but) I am almost certain that your doctor had your best interests in mind. I can't imagine that they wanted to poke and prod you for NO reason. Also, the reason for your routine physical is simply this-PREVENTION. This is how doctors catch prostate cancer, diabetes, AD, etc etc.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that you think that physicians somehow want to do procedures for the hell of it. I've even heard the mantra, \"if you don't take out a healthy appendix every once in a while, you're probably not doing enough appendectomies.\" (In this case, symptoms point to an appie, but it really isn't one... it happens on occasion.) But don't for a second think that you shouldn't go for a routine physical every year. Yes, there will be some hassles. Yes, there will be some false positives.

You see, our parents were immigrants, working earnestly to put food on the table and pay the bills. At the time, there was no money for books. There was one book in our home.<br/>As a first generation American I was curious about the ways of American families and how we could fit into this society. Along with my schooling, the library helped me do this. When I visited it every week, I went first to this set of orange clad biographies, written expressly for the young - to learn about American heroes. One of those books was chosen along with one from children's fiction. These gave me insight as to how some American families lived. Then there were the classics, some pure fantasy, that enriched my imagination. How fortunate I was to have access to this special place.<br/>Now 60 years later, in retirement, I volunteer at our public library as a Friend, in appreciation for the building that has meant so much to me.   Early on, I thought the library belonged to Mr. Carnegie. Fortunately it belongs to the community.

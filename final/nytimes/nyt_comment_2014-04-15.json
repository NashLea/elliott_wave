I am a Jew, and it is clear to me that anti-Semitism continues to fester.

(Such events have taken place at Northeastern University in Boston and at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and elsewhere.)<br/><br/>The American Jewish community, sadly, is often far too complacent  or perhaps timid with respect to confronting anti-Semitism. The abhorrent slayings in Kansas City a day before the Passover holiday are a tragic wake-up call. Anti-Semitism must be recognized, confronted and extinguished, ideally through interfaith efforts that show compassion and appreciation for those of all faiths.<br/><br/>Anti-Semitism is even more entrenched and deadly in other parts of the world.  The murder of journalist Daniel Pearl in Pakistan is a case in point.<br/><br/>One more point: any type of racial, ethnic or religious prejudice is hateful.

Couple of silly typos -- the last row in the third and fourth rectangles should be 11, not 12.<br/><br/>I see someone has posted a couple of solutions for the 13 x 13 square. Here's at least an outline of the proof I had in mind for why it can't be done for a 12 x 12 square.<br/><br/>First, since the length of the side of the square is longer than the length of any of the rectangles, there must be at least two rectangles along each side of the square. Suppose that three rectangles are all on one side of the square, with different widths, say 3, 4 and 5. Since they all must have different lengths, too, there is no way to fill the remaining space in the square with only two more rectangles.<br/><br/>Therefore, the only way you can divide the square into five rectangles, where none of the lengths or widths match, is like the example I gave earlier, where four of the rectangles are arranged with their edges overlapping around the fifth rectangle, which touches none of the edges of the square.<br/><br/>For the 11 x 11 square, one of the rectangles touching the sides of the square had a width of only 1, which worked, because the rectangle with a length of 10 butted against it, and the combination completed one of the edges of the square. However, with a 12 x 12 square, the rectangle with a width of 1 cannot be on one of the edges, because it would take a rectangle with a length of 11 to complete one of the sides of the square, and our longest rectangle has a length of only 10.

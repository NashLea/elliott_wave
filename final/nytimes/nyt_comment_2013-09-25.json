Qualified females are hired at better rates than their male counterparts, promoted more rapidly, and highly sought after, given the corporate world's focus on gender equality.

Why must we have de facto gender quotas?<br/><br/>Furthermore, large expansions in entitlements to parents will lead to a backlash from employers and non-parents against them, as non-parents and employers are forced to support their lifestyle choices.

If we do not consider full-time caregiving employment (from childcare to eldercare workers) we are solidifying money as the only important measure of cultural self-worth.

So the issue here is that caregiving is feminized and feminized jobs are given low economic and cultural value (see teachers, nurses, etc) so that even those who are employed are substantially underpaid. Then, if women continue to be socialized that caregiving and typically \"feminized\" professions are what they are best suited to from a very young age and they grow up to value those functions and earn substantially less or drop out of the workforce entirely, is anyone surprised? The only way to change the discussion is to start paying teachers and nurses and caregivers--all the traditionally \"feminine\" career paths--a living wage and raise their standard of living to a place where these professions will attract both men and women, while also recognizing that childcare is not a cop out but an actual, valid job.

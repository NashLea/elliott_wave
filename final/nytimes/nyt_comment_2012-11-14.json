Many of them remain dependent on men their entire lives and never experience freedom of choice and the sense of being equal.  Although Central Asian men can appreciate a servile, docile wife, many of them are also not satisfied in such a relationship and say they would prefer a more equal partner.  But to have one they would have to give up the perks of patriarchy, which is not easy for them.  Since childhood they learned they are entitled because of their gender.  Oh how I wish they went through a Swedish kindergarten!  <br/><br/>Some will argue that the Swedes are overdoing this, that they are emasculating boys, etc.  Please lets consider the unequal conditions most women on this planet live under.  And then lets appreciate every single effort that's being made to create more quality between the sexes.  Thank you, Sweden!

Today, that premium is up to 1000%.  A home that sells for $135K in Dallas would go for $1.35MM in Santa Monica!  Parts of the northeast are on a similar trajectory.  Yet, salaries are not 10 times higher in LA than in Dallas.  The issue is not high taxes, it's the unspeakable cost of housing.

The Giants recently played a game in 2:06, and were almost as efficient the following day However, today's game ran 3:34, even without any of those painfully slow NYC reviews.  While it was an exciting game, but only the beer vendors want games to last that long. <br/><br/>Some pitchers like Tim Lincecum and Jon Lester routinely deliver successive pitches within the 12 second official limit, while the umps let relievers in tight situations stall and fidget for 30 seconds or more.  It's well-known that fielders are less alert when the game drags.<br/><br/>Let's make the batter stay in the box after any pitch where he doesn't make contact.  No more of this Nomar-inspired redoing of the velcro after each pitch, even when they just \"took\" the pitch. Umpires should be able to award balls and strikes for delay of the game, and networks showing games should be prevented from adding commercials that extend the break between half-innings beyond the official 2 minutes and 15 seconds.  Maybe we'll only get an average of 10 minutes back, but that's more than 25 hours over a season.

I think the most necessary time for me to add the 3 hour extension in recording the game was when Mike Pelfrey pitched for the Mets.  I was always prepared to be up beyond midnight.  It always pained me to watch him.

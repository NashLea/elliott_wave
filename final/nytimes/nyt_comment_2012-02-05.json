One of my former neighbors was a contractor who worked on a cash-only basis, paying probably much less in taxes than he would honestly have owed, including Social Security taxes. He died suddenly of an apparent heart attack while still in his fifties, but had he lived decades longer, he might very well have met the same plight as some of those portrayed in this story: aged, disabled, and therefore unable to work, but unable to rely on the benefits to which they would have been entitled had the proper taxes been collected and paid. Social Security provides an excellent return for the dollars paid by most workers, and any worker whose annual Social Security statements do not accurately reflect his or her covered income (most earned income up to about $106,000) should ensure that such errors are corrected, lest  he or she also be reduced, at some point,  to begging others for help. Government cannot be blamed for the plight of those who refuse to participate in the safety-net programs it creates or who knowingly allow their employers to circumvent laws requiring the collection and payment of payroll taxes.<br/><br/>That having been said, I hope other more fortunate families will join mine in increasing contributions to food banks and utility assistance funds, because to stand by and do nothing while the poor among us suffer is simply unacceptable.

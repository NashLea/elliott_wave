I experienced some of the difficulties you described due to the uncertainty that can occur in determining whether a thyroid tumor is benign or malignant from the pathology.  When I was age 29, I had a thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy to remove a 4.5 cm follicular neoplasm.  The first pathologist who looked at it did not identify any capsular or vascular invasion or any necrosis, but did note some suspicious features including the presence of scattered mitoses, a predominantly solid/trabecular pattern of growth, and a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio.  He wasn't sure of the diagnosis and sent it to a more expert pathologist, who diagnosed it as \"minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma\" on the basis of those features and also \"pretty convincing evidence of capsular invasion as well as foci suggestive of vascular invasion\".  My surgeon recommended completion thyroidectomy and one dose of radioiodine treatment, but also indicated that it would not be unreasonable for me to decide not to get any further treatment since I would have a low risk of recurrence.  Because I had read that the diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma is usually made on the basis of definite invasion, and the opinions of the two pathologists seemed to differ on this point, I sought additional opinions from two more pathologists.  Neither of them reported definite invasion, but they did seem to err on the side of caution by deferring to the existing diagnosis.  Then I entered graduate school and got very busy, so I never finalized a decision about whether to get the further treatment that had been offered to me.  I am now 34, and have had no subsequent evidence of disease.  I get regular neck ultrasounds, and take Levoxyl to suppress my TSH as directed by my endocrinologist.  I still have the option of getting a completion thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment.  Do have any thoughts on whether this case calls for such treatment given all the uncertainty in the pathology?

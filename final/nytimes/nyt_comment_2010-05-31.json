That is is a slippery slope can be seen by the first reader comment to the article, in which a reader maintains that integration does not exist unless there is intermarriage -- presumably as a norm rather than as an exception.<br /><br />I have on several occasions commented on what I consider to be the unavoidable implications of innate behavioral predilections favored by evolution, as discussed some months ago in articles published in the \"Science Times\" section of the New York Times.  It seems to me that a frank recognition of \"otherness,\" unvarnished by ideology which would deny its very existence, or at least deny that it constitutes \"significant otherness,\" is innate in every individual.  Moreover, as every genetic variation occurred in some discrete population group, at some discrete time and place, and as some of these variations might well be considered improvements (or \"upgrades,\" in computer parlance), it is not unreasonable to suppose that individuals with these genetic variants might be innately disposed to foster them by means of selective breeding.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1502731, "replies": [], "lft": 466, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30medals-t.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2056343, "rgt": 467, "userDisplayName": "Joseph Lindsley", "createDate": "1275240761", "userID": 50225763, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1275278619", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": 13778, "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1275275019", "commentSequence": 194, "commentBody": "Could it have anything to do with dishonorable wars?<br />A late return to moral decisions?<br />Or...that some veterans of these -long late wars- have demonstrated against the illegal wars they were forced to fight?<br />That  they feel they have debased themselves as well as the people they have debased in the doing of their duties?<br />Just asking.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1504750, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30Mayor-t.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2056361, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "fbkun96", "createDate": "1275241259", "userID": 60490207, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1275278619", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Nijmegen, Netherlands", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1275275019", "commentSequence": 25, "commentBody": "It has become a tired clich\u00e9 to talk of the French banlieues as a kind of no-go zone where a visitor risks his life at any time of the day.

Anytime established media comes out and tries to trivialize new artistic efforts, its time to pay attention and disable your preconcepts so you can open up to new perspetives and contribute to the evolution of our culture.  I think many of us watching this oil gusher in the Gulf are feeling the forces of revolution rising up where we need so scream or have someone do it for us.  Its become a metaphore - an architype in my dreams for uncontrollable forces - be they Banksters in NYC, or the earth's high pressure oil, or the sun's solar flares, or our own teenager's unrelenting requests for money and refusal to get serious about growing up.   With homeless and joblessness increasing, revolution will become part of the mainstream, not something we all criticize - pointing to terrorists.   If crime suddenly increased in your neighborhood, wouldn't you think about arming yourself and getting training?  Well this summer there will be more riots as the oppressed and exploited rise up and say they 've had enough.  They will be looking for someone like Maya to find her groove and accurately and loudly express their feelings - to gush forth, relieving the building pressure, releasing the tension and maybe even letting us know we don't have to just let others manipulate this world.  Its ok to fight back, to organize and when faced with a strong military, guerilla warfare is about all you have left - See Red Dawn 1984, but imagine the enemy is here within.  Lets not forget our country started with the Revolutionary war declaring our independence from a tyrannical over taxing Colonial power.  Here in Morristown, where he originally camped, I wonder where our George Washington is today.  I see Maya as one of the earlier more insightful ones trying to convert feelings many of us share into warning shouts to rouse us from our American stupor. She is still young, maturing, trying to sort out the various forces at work around her -  Lets give her and others like her a chance to find herself, her mission, and give voice to what needs to be said.

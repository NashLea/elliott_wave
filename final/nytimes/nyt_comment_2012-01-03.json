The GOP response is to abolish Medicare and replace it with inadequate vouchers that seniors would have to use to try to purchase insurance in the marketplace. All that approach does is shift costs to individuals and ration care away from people who cannot afford it. <br/><br/>The progressive approach is to instead pursue the massive amounts of savings available in the system that could be achieved without reducing care. Requiring expensive new treatments, devices, and drugs to prove their value in comparison to cheaper traditional options through comparative effectiveness research (which was funded as part of the 2009 stimulus legislation) and a strengthened Independent Payment Advisory Board (which President Obama has proposed but which Congress hasn't agreed to).  Two other areas for savings are allowing Medicare and other government providers to use their market power to negotiate for lower prices, and to expand Medicare to cover more people, as Medicare is far more cost effective than private insurance. <br/><br/>In my view, rationalizing health care spending is a far better option than shifting ever higher costs to seniors and rationing care away from those who cannot afford it. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 86}, {"assetID": 3298291, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 5173840, "replies": [], "commentID": 5177240, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "bfree", "createDate": "1325610367", "userID": 56836147, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1325616746", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Stu Freeman", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "portland", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1325616746", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I'm sorry Stu but we have a country to run, not a drama class to teach.

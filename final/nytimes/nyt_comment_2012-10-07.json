It's interesting that this seems to have gone out of fashion.<br/><br/>Part of the reason might be that many browsers now start with a default that displays the most frequently visited pages (Chrome and Safari led with this functionality).  Perhaps many also \"graduated\" from using their browser home page this way to using desktop-based applications, or decided that they would rather have more actual news presented to them.  It's funny to me how many people I know that use <a href=\"http://nytimes.com\" title=\"nytimes.com\" target=\"_blank\">nytimes.com</a> as their home page.<br/><br/>I think the most likely explanation might be that people don't conceive of \"going to the Internet\" in some abstract sense, but launch browser sessions either from a link in an email, or with a definite destination in mind.  My experience talking to people is that the novelty of having all sorts of interesting stuff greet you at the beginning of a session is outweighed (or negated) by wanting to get where you're going quickly and without an advertising-laden interim station.<br/><br/>(And, personally, I never really got iGoogle to do what I wanted - there seemed to be more of a learning curve with it than some other offerings; and I never actually go to Google's site to perform a search - another advantage of newer browsers).", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3341900, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/qa-moving-on-from-igoogle/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7299817, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "bollox", "createDate": "1349382443", "userID": 6236195, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1349583853", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "philly", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1349580253", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "who cares ?", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3342441, "replies": [], "lft": 87, "assetURL": "http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/wyoming-energy-and-libertarianism/", "parentID": 7317567, "commentID": 7319626, "rgt": 88, "userDisplayName": "Cleareyed", "createDate": "1349583791", "userID": 59528854, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1349583854", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Wyoming", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1349580254", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Throeau101, it must have been some time since you've studied the Constitution.

This is the same guy who says that Obama took his idea of saving Detroit (and yet also maintains he was against an auto bailout). He certainly would have continued TARP. And there would have been no stimulus package, which even Republican economists admit had a significant economic effect of keeping more people from being laid off and circulating more money to regular people by cutting taxes for the non-rich.<br/><br/>What would Romney have done? Hire his consultants at Bain Capital to gut the country, outsource jobs, and net more money for management? That's uncharitable and not what he would have done at all, but he's allowing himself to luxuriate in being the worst kind of politician. He knows he wouldn't have done better but that doesn't stop him from opportunistically pretending like he would have, anyway. The economy was too terrible for anything short of our response to the Great Depression (i.e., the New Deal), so he would have had no better solutions and possibly would have done much worse. Thus, Mitt Romney is a smart and deeply cynical man.<br/><br/>In fact, you know that from two statements:<br/>\n1. \"A lot of the economic woes you see around you are the result of errors that have been made over a long period of time, but what has happened in the last couple of years has not helped\"<br/>\n2. \"The president\u2019s policies almost without question have caused this recession to be deeper and longer than it would have been with better policies\"<br/><br/>By technical terms, the recession ended a while ago. The president's plans were actually able to stop the recession, but various forces have kept them from igniting a recovery that could recoup so many job losses. Republicans throwing a fit at his attempts to do so haven't helped.

It's not a fair comparison, of course, since 12 years of progress should provide a better side. What's surprising is how far and how quickly everyone else has progressed.<br/><br/>I was also interested in tactical progress. France in particular are interesting. They started in a 4321, which failed against a surprisingly compact Nigerian defense. They switched to a 433, spread the defense, and won (and killed Canada as well). Later matches they played a 4231, which I thought less successful. But maybe that was because it was deeper in the tournament and lack of experience was hurting them.<br/><br/>Japan lack a target striker, they like the ball at feet, so the 442 made sense. Their wings tended to drift inside and the backs (especially the excellent Sameshima) were constantly bombing up the wing, which put a lot of pressure on opposing defenses. Well coached, well organized team.<br/><br/>The US formation rather puzzled me. Our scoring struggles were well established at this point, yet we played two defensive mids and our backs generally stayed at home. We played Cheney out of position and left Morgan and Rapinoe on the bench. Still don't get it.<br/><br/>Also still don't get Neid's lineup against Japan. When they were desperate for ideas, why leave Bajramaj on the bench?<br/><br/>Then there was Brazil's 343 with that hideous sweeper. The odd thing is that if anyone has the talent to play a 343 it's Brazil (but no sweeper, please). It requires possession domination in the opponent's half, winning the ball high up the pitch, comfort on the ball under pressure, and wings with pace that can track back. Brazil have the players for this, but not the communication,tactics, or cohesion. So far only Barca can really pull it off, and that's because they've grown up playing together.

Conservatives like to couch their pretend support for balanced budgets in terms of a family balancing its check book. But families go into debt all the time by doing things like taking out a mortgage to buy a house, or a loan to purchase a car or attend college. Similarly, our government needs to run deficits in order to invest in infrastructure and education, to defend our country, and to provide a safety net. The key for both families and our country is to keep deficits at an appropriate level, not to pretend like all deficits are bad. <br/><br/>Second, deficits are necessary to serve as a counter to low economic demand during economic recessions. Without such counter-cyclical spending, our economy will spiral downwards, which caused unemployment and untold pain for millions of Americans. Such a downwards spiral also causes our deficits to increase, as social safety net spending goes up, while revenue goes down due to low economic growth. So, such Keynesian spending actually helps reduce the deficit in the long run if done correctly. <br/><br/>The inappropriate approach to deficits is that taken by the conservatives who pretend to oppose deficits, but actually run them up by spending on unnecessary things. For example, the current high deficits are caused largely by tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the unnecessary war in Iraq, and unnecessary corporate subsidies in the GOP prescription drug plan. In addition, the GOP is opposed to Democratic efforts to rationalize currently wasteful health care spending, even though that is necessary to reduce the long term deficits.  <br/><br/>We should reduce the deficit by cutting wasteful tax loopholes and spending, but not by ignoring the important benefits that deficit spending provides.  <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 75}, {"assetID": 2993882, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://projects.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/07/20/presidents-and-their-debts-fdr-to-bush/fdr-budget-hawk", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4192944, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Ron T", "createDate": "1311218658", "userID": 21443941, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1311221758", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Mpls", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1311218158", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "The whole debt ceiling hoopla is pure nonsense.<br/><br/>In a fiat monetary system (the US now), the federal \"debt\" is a completely different animal compared to the gold standard.<br/><br/>Only countries using the gold standard, foreign currency pegs or Euro can go bankrupt and need to balance the budget over the business cycle, but the US abandoned the gold standard in 1971.<br/><br/>\"Debt\" is a burden, something to be paid off with scarce assets.

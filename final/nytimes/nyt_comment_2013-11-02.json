That's not, of course, what Wall Street wants. It wants either rapidly growing companies or those that are failing, or appearing to fail, so that it can make money by pulling support out from under them. <br/><br/>For the better part of ten years, print has been talked down, first, by reporters and editors who ran \"woe is me\" stories by the hundreds as layoffs hit newspapers, and next by Wall Street, ready to feast on the fading. Did anyone stop to think that it was never written in God's own tablets that every major newspaper was supposed to have hundreds and hundreds of editorial employees, bureaus around the world, Washington bureaus and to spend endlessly sending reporters almost anywhere they wanted to go?  Some senior reporters at major publications seemed to be on virtual scholarships.<br/><br/>The wall between church and state was a fiction, but a useful one.

Look at the Kerala story for a region in India that has reduced total fertility rate through progressive social policies that do not entail massive industrialization, corporatization and consumption paradigms. They have increased literacy, reduced the birthrate, and increased average income without the onus of unsustainable capitalism. The population of India does not account for the consumption of one third of the earth's resources by one fifth of the population.

We cannot continue to open more lands to agriculture without long term effects. Agriculture, especially as it is practiced now, leads to soil degradation and lack of biodiversity. The more land cleared for agriculture, the more land is vulnerable to becoming a wasteland. Trees, which hold water and reduce flooding are cleared. Land that once held numerous species is reduced to one single type of crop planting. Animals, insects etc. that depended on the diversity of flora to procreate, hibernate, migrate are closed out and threatened, etc. In other words, using land to grow crops leads to inherent problems, if other than on an extremely small scale. Even with the most sustainable practices, agriculture is a practice that causes disruption and fragility of ecological systems. Farming is inherently risky as regards to biological cycles. <br/><br/>As regards to fishing, please look into projections for losses of global fish populations.

We have been down this road before. China, Japan and Korea(s) are relatively resource poor.

The Japanese lost that war, but the basic need for energy and resources controled by Japan lives on today. China threatens those resources in several ways!<br/><br/>First, China covets the same resources as Japan for the same reasons. This is not about small islands, this is about lots of oil and gas around the small islands.<br/><br/>Second, China sees itself as the only truly civilized nation on earth, it matters not at all what we think of that view, however we need to recognize that is how the Chinese see things. Japan is the only country that can chalange China in the reigon. There is history of each invading the other in the past and both invading Korea using it as a proxy in their disputes.<br/><br/>Third, everyone has more or less \"played nice\" since WW2 because of the U.S., past hates aside and wated for the U.S. to get tired and go home.

I would like to see the outcome studies.  However, why not have a program that pays employees with alcoholism respectable wages with an additional beer allowance on the job?  Also, why not incorporate a beer wean into the program for those interested?  Would that not give these people a greater chance for success?

They haven't, yet, and that's not the Chinese mentality from long tradition.  Basically, the U.S. is trying the olde Anglo-Saxon tactic of divide-and-conquer by sowing discord between other Asian countries and China, and cozying up to any conflict they get whiff of.  It's always easy to find jingoists in any country to exacerbate conflicts where none need to be. <br/><br/> My hope is that China will surprise everyone by being wise and magnanimous by offering other countries some island here or there in return for the ones they want.

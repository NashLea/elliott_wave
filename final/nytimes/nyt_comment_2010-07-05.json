(Also, Andy could have noted which solar technology is to be used). Solar energy captured with mirrors is far more thermodynamically efficient that solar energy captured by solar cells.  Energy storage comes naturally, and the bigger the plant, the more efficient the storage, because volume (and energy stored) goes as R^3 while surface area (and heat loss) goes as R^2. With a big-enough tank of molten salt, the energy can be stored for weeks. The technology is not mature and the costs per megawatt are not comparable to mature technology (as #16 Gene G pointed out), and the plant is far smaller than a maximally efficient plant would be.<br /><br />James #18, a Nevada resident, complains about \"thousands of acres.\" Ten thousand acres covers a square four miles on a side.  It will generate energy forever (barring climate change).<br /><br />Maturing technology will require less frequent overhauls.  Compared to nuclear, which generates neutrons that destroy the materials of the plant, equipment life could be much longer.  High-voltage DC transmission lines (made feasible by power semiconductors) will permit transmission of this energy over long distances.<br /><br />And, in any case, what the economy needs now (with high unemployment and target interest rates required to bring the unemployment down at negative 6%), is spending which leaves the dollars in U.S. consumer hands.

My parents bought into this concept 100%.  It can be a matter of pride and socialization.  It can be costly in the terms of isolation, transportation, and worry for the frail elder.  Sometimes, letting an individual design their own demise is the only thing that a family can do if the elder remains stubborn.

There are many advantages to living in smaller spaces that still maintain independence and privacy.  But, our \"American\" dream pushes most people towards the value of home ownership.  Lately, it has become the American nightmare just like the approaching plethora of \"baby boomers\" who are not as flexible as stated earlier.  This will be another financial nightmare unless compromises are reached and people forget that it isn't always about \"them\" but about other younger generations, financial feasibility, and our ecosystem.

I have a unique position in the health care system that provides me with the opportunity to work in both the emergency department at the local hospital and in the community seeing clients/patients in their home (house, condo, senior living community, hospice, etc).  I agree 110% with the author... you learn more about how the person is managing in 5 minutes at home than 5 hours in the ER.  Someone's ability to manage safely at home has as much to do with their physical environment (and social supports such as friends/family) as it does with their physical health.  Focus needs to be about making sure their physical/cognitive/social/emotional abilities are appropriately matched with their surroundings at home.

This doesn't apply to us now, and I think we've actually doubled our life expectancy in the past few tens of thousands of years.<br /><br />So based on all this, I think we'll be living longer, but never wind up evolving out of dying by some clever mutation.

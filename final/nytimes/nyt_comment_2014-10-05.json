This explains why wage growth continued through 2009.  It also explains the higher than expected job losses.  Instead of moving down the supply of workers curve to a new equilibrium price and quantity, we moved to the intercept of the shifted demand curve with the higher minimum wage.  Wagers were higher than they would have been without the new minimum wage level, but employment was sharply reduced.<br/><br/>As the economy has recovered and the demand for workers curve shifted back to the right, we moved back along the minimum wage line.

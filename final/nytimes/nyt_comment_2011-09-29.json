In any case , it would be fun to see the cups being blown right there in the shop. This activity alone owould generate interest. Perhaps you could accept glass for recycling in the store too, too highhlight the eco-concious nature of the process and product.

It will simply mean that our representatives need to roll up their sleeves, and work towards another solution. I will however concede that's a nearly impossible task considering the current partisan divides. You are correct in your assessment for the short term though.<br/><br/>I agree with many others here who argue that the only sensible solution is single payer healthcare. The unfortunate reality is that the Obama administration cooperated with Republican law makers to such a degree that the resulting legislation left everyone wanting. I'm convinced I'll see single payer healthcare become a reality within my lifetime. I hope it comes sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>I'm hoping Obama has learned from his failures, and will cease making such painful compromises in hopes of building a consensus. It's plainly obvious he's dealing with an entire party who value his failure above the success of the nation. The sad thing is, it may already be too late to have a chance of winning a second term in office.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 3283344, "replies": [], "lft": 328, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/us/justice-dept-asks-supreme-court-for-health-care-ruling.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4603827, "rgt": 329, "userDisplayName": "K Henderson", "createDate": "1317268786", "userID": 58089209, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1317269743", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1317266143", "commentSequence": 134, "commentBody": "So Pres.

So Obamacare is, thankfully, history.  Then, with both House and the White House under adult supervision, the tort laws are changed and the barriers to interstate competition are eliminated.  Prices drop, doctors return to their practices after having been driven out by Obamacare, sensible medical insurance subsidies for the poor are introduced and what had been the world's greatest medical care system once again stands proud.

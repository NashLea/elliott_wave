While austerians are working to serve the short term interests of a narrow economic elite, they are actually undermining the system that generates the wealth that such narrow elite is so obsessed with amassing. And they are doing so by creating an economic system that no longer benefits the rest of society. <br/><br/>History has proven time after time that free markets are the best generators of wealth and have pulled billions of people out of poverty. At the same time, a free market economic system can survive and thrive only when it is combined with governmental policies that ensure that the wealth that is generated improves society as a whole. In other words, the free market system must be tempered and supported by progressive policies that set the ground rules for the system, invest in the public sphere, provide a safety net, and support the rights of workers to organize for their interests. <br/><br/>The austerians have undermined the implicit bargain upon which free market economies throughout the world have thrived. In response to the Great Depression, we had the New Deal that saved capitalism from itself.  Now, instead, austerians have taken advantage of the 2008 recession to impose policies that enriched a narrow set of banksters, while imposing harsh results on everyone else. The results won't be good for anyone in the long run. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 403}, {"assetID": 3360799, "replies": [], "lft": 190, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/opinion/krugman-austerity-italian-style.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8376973, "rgt": 191, "userDisplayName": "Ken Winkes", "createDate": "1361768426", "userID": 57056906, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1361768477", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Conway, WA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1361768477", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "Some who preach austerity know better but are just protecting their \"hard money\" interests; why would billionaire bondholders wish to see their debt holdings diminish in value, particularly when their  current return in interest is so low?

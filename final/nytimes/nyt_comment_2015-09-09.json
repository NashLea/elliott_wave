And how partisan politics is played like a blood sport in this country. I just find it absurd we're still fighting over the Vietnam War. After the fall of Saigon in April, 1975, we all know what a disaster this war was. Yet here we are almost five decades after the war still fighting about the war. So Trump is a pathological liar. What else is new when it comes to politics in this country?  Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War aa senator and then lobbied as secretary of state for Obama to get the US involved in the Libyan ivil war. Both are now foreign policy debacles that rank with the Vietnam War.  And she'll probably be our next president. That's as absurd as what Trump has said about the Vietnam War in this article.

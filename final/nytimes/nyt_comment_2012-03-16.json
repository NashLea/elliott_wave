The fact is no president in history has control gas price, because it's a global commodity, which it can be fluctuated base on Wall Street speculation.  If president Obama can control gas price, he would set it at 0.99 cents per gallon, so he can stimulate this economy further just like he has being fighting for payroll tax cut for working for American, for middle class tax cut, for unemployment extension, etc, and wrap up the election now, instead of still fighting.

We have an incumbent president that is below 50% in polls, really just a little over 42% in approvel. This time Obama  will not be the easy sell by the liberal media like in 2008. Lol. He has a track record and his track record is not very appealing to most of the electorate. His solution to our nations problems is to spend his way out of them and create massive deficits to load on future generations. Democrat senate that has failed to pass a budget in over three years. Refused to sign off on the Keystone pipeline and lost jobs for alot of union members, high gas prices, bailed out Wall Street, first president toireside over a downgrade in our credit rating, Huge unemployment, the real number is around 18% when you count the number of people that have quit looking and the number working part time jobs, 1% growth in our economy, more people on food stamps than ever.

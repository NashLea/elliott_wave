The CDC totaled a count of 33,000 deaths by guns. 23,000 were suicides, and remember that Japan does not allow citizens to own guns yet their suicide rate is almost double the U.S.. So now we are at 10,000 deaths by guns, of which gang bangers that get their guns off the street account for 5,000 deaths, so now we are at 5,000 deaths, and 3,000 are from police shootings and the other 2,000 are actual premeditated killings and someone going nutso and shooting people. So where are these big numbers you are talking about? 36,000 people died in car accidents last year. Over 400,000 die from a medical malfunction, why do we not get rid of doctors? Your logic defies reason.

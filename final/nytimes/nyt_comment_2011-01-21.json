That's one way to read his new state budget, which seeks to eliminate the $25 billion deficit with equal parts spending cuts (primarily to social services) and tax increases. The new governor wants voters to re-impose the 2009 tax hikes on themselves for another five years \u2013 the same taxes they overwhelmingly refused to extend for two years. Mindful of that outcome, Brown has embraced blackmail: Renew the tax hikes or school spending will be slashed.<br /><br />Brown's budget is a doomed half-measure that confirms he is a conventional liberal. The spending cuts are significant but insufficient, and in the unlikely event voters renew the tax hikes, the damage to our anemic economy virtually guarantees the promised revenue won't materialize.<br />A recent study of how governments cope with deep deficits and debt found those that successfully restored fiscal order employed budget solutions consisting, on average, of 85 percent spending cuts (including 22 percent cut from government wages and salaries). The typical failed solutions relied on equal parts tax hikes and spending cuts \u2013 Jerry Brown's formula.<br /><br />Most revealing is what the new budget plan doesn't do: tackle the pension time bomb and the bloated state payroll. Given the magnitude of our chronic deficits, the state payroll should be rolled back at least to 2000 levels, yet Brown's budget merely extends Schwarzenegger-era pay cuts to a few segments of the state workforce.<br /><br />Why target welfare recipients instead of state employees? Because welfare recipients don't have a union. Public employee unions spent $40 million on Brown's behalf, and they expect a return on their investment. On his first day in office, Brown replaced seven pro-charter-school reformers on the state Board of Education with status quo educrats \u2013 including the lobbyist for the state teachers union.<br /><br />The hard truth is: Restoring California's fiscal health requires dramatically downsizing the number of state employees and their unsustainable pensions and benefits. That would require Jerry Brown turning on the public employee unions that elected him \u2013 an act of political audacity that would make Nixon going to China seem like a Sunday school picnic.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 2321736, "replies": [], "lft": 408, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/business/economy/21bankruptcy.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3264796, "rgt": 409, "userDisplayName": "c.moon", "createDate": "1295582822", "userID": 59934156, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295588886", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Ca", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295588886", "commentSequence": 171, "commentBody": "This is the only solution for the states to get rid of over 2 T dollars of pension liability in this country.

A little reality. There is NO correlation between public sector unions and the size of state budget crises. NONE. I know. I ran the numbers on public-sector union density on one hand, and relative size of state budget holes. Sorry, folks. It doesn't exist. There are lots of reasons that states are in financial trouble, but the pension shortfalls are a short-term problem, not a structural one. Moreover, unions didn't cause it. They bargained in good faith, and often gave up wage gains in order to fund their pensions. By and large, they DO NOT RUN these pension plans, either, and investment decisions are made by public officials, not union people. Thus, the combination of states not fully funding their obligations when times were flush and the lousy investments that Wall Street assured them were good, means that there's a gap now. But to put this on the unions is just plain wrong. Further, let's take the average public employee pension in high-cost NYC: Do you know what it is? $19,000 per year. Assuming a $700/month rent (a blessing in this city, so a conservative figure), we're talking about a 44 percent rent burden, far above what is considered affordable.

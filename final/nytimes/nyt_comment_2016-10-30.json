The Jesus of the Gospels contradicts what these so-called evangelicals, particularly those who support Trump, appear to believe.<br/><br/>The Gospels are short and repetitive, and there is no mistake about the message. It is not a message that says you should hate anyone, or exclude anyone, or hurt anyone, or that wealth is a sign of god's favor and poverty a sign of rejection.<br/><br/>The salespeople who say different are simply not Christian.

Unfortunately, we bought into this, whichever side we are on.  Because the voters don't want to get into policy details and their likely outcomes, Ms. Clinton too saw this approach as the easiest and surest path to victory: focus on Mr. Trump's personality and temperament, unsuited for office.

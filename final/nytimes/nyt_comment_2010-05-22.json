The living bacterium (Mycoplasma) that was synthesized was basically identical to the species in nature from which it was copied.  No new \"Frankenstein\" to behold here.  In almost all cases it would not be necessary to synthesize an organism entirely from chemicals off the shelf to produce a useful product.  Ordinary extant recombinant DNA technology should work just fine, thank you very much.<br /><br />This was largely an exercise in mastering new technologies, which, as a tool, may incrementally lead us to a more complete understanding of life at the molecular level, but not a protocol that's going to be routinely carried out.  It's too expensive, complex and time consuming.  The existing methods for splicing genes and creating genetic recombinants are much cheaper, easier and quicker.<br /><br />I daresay the real prime motivation for carrying out such an exercise was to be able to say:  it's possible, we can do it, we can produce a living thing using only simple chemicals and the basic information we have learned from studying living systems.  It's an existential break in the never-ending loop of \"life begets life.\"  We have shown that the mere knowledge gleaned from studying life can be used to beget life.  If you fear this, you fear truly understanding what you are as a living entity.<br /><br />It's ironic in that it took a long chain of experiments during the 18th and 19th centuries (culminating with Pasteur's famous swan-neck flasks) to disprove the theory of spontaneous generation, the notion that life could suddenly spring from abiotic precursors.   Now we have shown that, with knowledge and man's participation, it is possible to create something that lives from abiotic building blocks.  But do not think that this somehow violates the laws of nature or some deity.  The information that normally specifies a new cell resides within its living parental cell (mainly in its DNA).

Bacteria evolve quickly (sometimes within 24 hours) because they go through several generations quickly and because they can pass parts of their DNA around to each other. The bacteria with the mutations that are most advantageous for survival are selected for and those genes are passed on. Being able to evolve quickly is advantageous because the species is able to adapt to whatever harm comes it's way. As the human race advances and evolves, those that are able to evolve faster will gain an advantage. If a human could evolve overnight so that he was resistant to the damage caused by cigarette smoke or HIV or UV rays from the sun, that would be an advantage that would cause those genes to be passed on and the progeny of that lineage to survive better than ones that did not evolve.<br /><br />Being able to control evolution on a faster scale would lead to speciation and an evolutionarily advanced human race. Combined with genetic engineering and gene therapy these types of technologies could lead to not only choosing whether you want your yet to be born child to have brown or blue eyes, but eventually also whether you would want them to have more fast twitch muscles to run faster, greater lung capacity to hold their breath under water longer, more HGH production from their cells for stronger, bigger muscles, neurons that are able to integrate with computer circutry or even wings on their back to fly. Things that have already been accomplished such as making a cat's face glow in the dark, growing a human ear on the side of a mouse, giving mice increased HGH production to make Scwharzenager sized mice, and Venter's insertion of synthetic DNA code into a physical cell all are initial steps towards this type of technology.<br /><br />Because the upper class of a society is usually the first to be able to afford new technology that is vastly different, the first humans that would take advantage of this technology would be the ultra rich assuming the society is still based largely on capitalism. So there would be some humans that start evolving quickly into new species while most of the rest of the human world stays on the same course we currently are on. It's the same idea as the first humans to go into space in the next couple years on a commercial airline will be the ultra rich paying 250,000 US for a seat. And just like there are still monkeys and apes in today's world at the same time as humans, there will still be humans remaining while potentially many new, advanced human species are born into existence.<br /><br />Some might view this as unnatural. However, whatever humans do is natural relative to humans. So if humans are able to speed up their evolution or change their genetic makeup within a single lifetime, then it is because of their natural brain power and natural physical ability to do so and therefore, relative to humans, this is a natural evolution.<br /><br />Humans will be able to deal with the change in the Earth's temperature, i.e. global warming or whatever you want to call the cause of the polar caps melting which leads to a chain of events that change the planet in a small or large way. It is because of our ability to adapt. The polar bears that might go extinct are not able to adapt as well as humans are. This direction humans are now starting on that will lead us to the ability to control our genetic makeup and speed up evolution is happening whether you want deal with it or not. Hopefully as with any issue that arises, people will take the course of action that makes sense - accept it and move forward with it. It is the progression of humankind and if you don't accept it and move forward with it, you may end up being the monkey and someone else will be the human.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1483971, "replies": [], "lft": 48, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/adventures-in-synthetic-biology/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2019882, "rgt": 49, "userDisplayName": "HJBoitel", "createDate": "1274501357", "userID": 5315482, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1274501907", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1274498307", "commentSequence": 23, "commentBody": "The programming of living things has been going on since before recorded history.

That is not religion, it is fact.<br /><br />There is a lot that we do that will cause pain to creatures, harm to ourselves and adverse consequences to future generations. The fact is, however, that, particularly in the past century, we have increased, multiplied and vastly improved the lot of mankind, both in terms of lifespan and freedom from drudgery and disease.<br /><br />The literal structuring of DNA instructions is a qualitative change in our ability to modify life.The potential for the creation of countless organisms of change is clear and awesome, by orders of magnitude, as compared to our past modification of life forms. If we do not carefully control the process, mankind and other living things may suffer a great deal or even we may even make ourselves extinct. Imagine if the mistakes or negligence, like that which resulted in the BP oil \"spill\", happened with regard to the programming of organisms that might attack us directly or might make our environment uninhabitable. On the other hand, we may be able to program organism that will vastly improve out lives and those of future generations.<br /><br />There is clearly a need for informed regulation.

I agree.  It is mind boggling to observe the luke warm if not down right refusal of most Americans to acknowledge what's happening to our Southern brothers and sisters in their time of need.  What happened?  Where are America's college students who in the past, I rmember were passionate about important and urgent issues related to big business and especially government.  Why are they as a group not visibly  demonstrating their frustration with the passion that they use to have in the past? It seems to me that American anger and standing up for what is right and good for our country has been declawed and defanged.  How did this happen?  I would like to give this more thought.  For now we have lost our will to demonstrate for what's right for two reasons, money and fear and unfortunately hopelessness.  This is a grave time for America.  We must put our fears aside and fight for what is right.  Stand up against corporate power who through their quest for total deregulation will create an anarchy that may destroy us.

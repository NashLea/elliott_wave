There are data out there regarding the short term and long term costs of raising a child.  Start a spreadsheet and crunch the numbers.  Its not rocket science.<br /><br />Kids are wonderful but raising them well is incredibly expensive and time consuming.  Yes, its a question of love, and who wouldn't choose love?  But this kind of love costs real money and real time.  Plenty of people fail their kids because they are stressed out, overworked, underfunded and they plunk their kids in front of the TV and feed them junkfood and tell themselves, \"Hey, its OK, I'm doing the best I can\".  That may be true, but is it really good enough?  I say don't have them in the first place if thats all you have to give.  Human life deserves more than that.<br /><br />The fundamental question is not \"can I afford them.\"  For one thing, they are not possessions, and secondly, humans are pretty cheap to keep alive if mere survival is the goal.  The question is \"do I have the financial and emotional resources to raise good people?\"  What are your standards?  I'm not talking bugaboo strollers and froo-froo nurseries.  That's silliness.  Kids need to be loved and they need to be taught.  You cannot show them love when you are away, so you need to make time for them,  That is a challenge for dual income families and a greater one for single parents.  Teaching takes time and your money to the extent you outsource it, and outsourced education is expensive because of housing costs for good school districts or private school tuition.   And don't think that learning is all done at school -- homework, life skills, empathy, faith, work ethic, social responsibility -- somehow you have to find time to teach all this on your own.<br /><br />Raising good kids is expensive.

Enjoy the blue Med waters and be sure to slap on the sunscreen before you stretch out on your Hermes beach towel. (Did you snag one of those glorious Pucci bikinis?) And come back refreshed in time for the summer wrap-ups we're sure to be having OTR.<br /><br />Heatherlynn, welcome! And thanks for your kind nod. Isn't Fashion Land a wonderful, dizzying, crazy, tragic and hilarious place to escape to? Billions of dollars flying every hour of the day, designers conjuring up the next collection, ateliers filled with seamstresses and artisans bent over their work late into the night, wheeling and dealing of business partners and directors spinning faster and faster, gossip racing via twitter, fashion editors and bloggers vying to find the newest of the new, the freshest of the fresh, or the lowest of the depths - ahhh, Fashion Land!  And ahhh, OTR, where new voices are welcome, and anyone with a passion for fashion can join the dance and kick up their heels.<br /><br />It has been such a full year thus far that I'm planning to spend some time simply letting things settle a bit in my mind. For me, the sadness of McQueen's death still hangs heavily, but I am feeling very optimistic about the future of the house since Sarah Burton has taken the helm with such a sure touch. But there will never come another quite like Lee. His final pieces are truly amazing, priceless works of art. It is hard to look at the photos of them without feeling the loss afresh.<br /><br />It has been a wonderful year for Gaultier and Galliano, I think, and both have exhibited such joyfulness and sureness of touch that you feel like giggling and tossing a perfect ripe strawberry into an icy flute of La Veuve to celebrate. La Croix may have folded, but the two Mr. G's are carrying on the tradition of gaiety and romance and sheer sexiness.<br /><br />So many wonderful newer designers are making their mark: Haider Ackerman springs to mind (although HA has been around a while, this year there is a real movement going on there); Raf Simons continues to astonish. Herr Lagerfeld just keeps me on the edge of my seat all the time - his lion-hearted show was the epitome of . . . well, it was just the epitome of entertainment, as was his romp of resortwear through the Cote d'Azure. He is the showman first class! Valentino's tradition lives on - not quite as elegante as when Maestro Garavani was at the helm, but it moves, it breathes, and it holds still the essential romance that Valentino made so beautifully. Miuccia continues to challenge. Shoe business fascinates - where will it end? How much more can we heighten, decorate, embellish, lace and bedazzle our footwear? Fragrance (my dearest love) unfolds in ever more lovely colors and metaphors - got my bottle of Wonderwood last week, and have been living in a magical forest of mysteriously drifting allusions ever since!<br /><br />I've enjoyed the revelry as the invasion of the Teeny-Weeny Bloggers became a fascinating force in fashion reviewing and criticism - yes, I mean Miss Tavi and that little whippet BryanBoy and the glorious Jane sailing the Sea of Shoes. I've loved the Great Magazine Debate: will they live or die or simply become irrelevant? What will become of Anna? Carine? (Not for one moment do I believe they are going anywhere any time soon - not those two slender titans!)<br /><br />And I've rejoiced at the mere presence of Daphne Guinness in the world - her decision to purchase the marvelous collection of the late, great Issy Blow is a gift and a blessing, and was done from the finest and purest of motivations. Preserving the collection that Ms. Blow created, honoring Isabella's pursuit of excellence and her mentoring and discovery of so many wonderful talents, and reminding us that real friendship never dies - mille grazie, Daphne, from the heart.<br /><br />So I'm planning to let all this just swirl lazily around as the summer swims along up here in the Hudson Valley. Time to go berrying once the raspberries and blackberries ripen; time for the trek to my favorite Cape Cod beach to watch the waves roll in; time for another visit to California. Time to get more work done on a special writing project or two . . .<br /><br />Be good RJH, but not TOO good, if you get my drift! Hutton and E. Frantz, I'll see you on the Yellow Brick Road. Mr. Moholitny, here's a wave to you and thanks for your many insightful posts. To the Thrifters - happy pickings! May you stumble on a lovely cache of vintage YSL and Hermes!<br /><br />And to Cathy - - - YOU, my dear, are one in a million!<br /><br />I'll be reading OTR, posting when I can, and having adventures somewhere in Fashion Land.<br /><br />Cheers, one and all!<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1638761, "replies": [], "lft": 4, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/fields-pair/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2239581, "rgt": 5, "userDisplayName": "Howard B", "createDate": "1278734300", "userID": 49164631, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1278734759", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NJ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1278731159", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Congratulations to those intrepid souls who braved their way through the puzzle, and good luck to those who have temporarily put it aside in the attempt.

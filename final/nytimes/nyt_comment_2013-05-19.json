Indiana guards the three very well.<br/>I also think they have to use the pick and roll with Prigioni or Felton more often.

Then, having spent years faking ordinariness, the candidate is suppose to conjure up extraordinary judgement, courage and insight in making critical decisions. ONLY in America would a multi-millionaire owner of five or six houses and many Cadillacs like Mitt Romney even dare to compare himself with the struggles of everyday citizens. <br/><br/>The fact is, we want our presidents and those of whom we expect extraordinary leadership to be outstanding people. Yet, we insist they must be rooted in plain American soil. This is a silly contradiction and maybe, down deep, most people see through this fakery. While we say we want average Joes (Biden?) with great brain power and experience, we consistently vote for those who have spent years in the Ivy League and whose lives are vastly unlike those of 99% of voters. We have had all  numerous election cycles with preppy school grads on both tickets and no one even comments. <br/><br/>We say we want \"self made men\" (and women), but we vote for those who've had it easy, whose fathers and grandfathers did the dirty work of making money so they could run for office and look cool.

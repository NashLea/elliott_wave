Flint had the kind of money problems common in many rustbelt cities undermined by the export of jobs. Michigan\u2019s solution was to appoint an emergency administrator to rule, not govern.   To save money, he decided Flint would abandon Detroit\u2019s water system and use water from the Flint River.

The alarm was raised, but it was months before the authorities acknowledged the problem and eventually restored Detroit city water.  This was only a partial fix; the newly leached plumbing had been stripped of protective organic matter and remains a source of lead.   Long lasting as the damage is to physical infrastructure, it\u2019s irreversible for people who have been harmed.  That\u2019s injustice of the first magnitude.

Medicare is projected (by its own trustees) to be bankrupt in just a few years; and Democrats aren't getting new taxes to avoid the need to transform it into something strategically viable.

That is why Romney and the rest of the GOP refuse to provide basic information about Romney's tax plans, jobs plans, foreign policy positions, etc. And it is why the GOP is trying so hard to suppress voting among Democratic leaning groups throughout the country.  <br/><br/>The GOP realizes that if an educated public is allowed to vote, the Republicans will get demolished in November. As a result, they are trying their best to make sure that people do not get educated about what the GOP stands for, and to keep Democrats from being able to vote.

Considering the long history of the close and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Israel, it has always puzzled me why from the get go these two gentlemen have been unable to simply respect their differences yet consider the bigger picture of Israel located in a sea of Arab hatred from the very beginning in 1947/48 and that the US has been its faithful friend and guarantor during all that time, which it is clear a majority of Americans wish to see continue.<br/><br/>Is it possible that from the time that President Obama delivered his Cairo speech in 2009 that Israel has become worried regarding US intentions ? Or has that speech and subsequent outreach, such as aid to the Libyan rebels, and the withdrawal  of support from President Mubarak of Egypt and subsequent support of the Moslem Brotherhood leadership there, led to further Israeli concerns ? <br/><br/>Now that the events of 09/11/2012 in Libya and Egypt shocked the US is it possible that our policy in that part of the world needs to be refined ? It may be a very good idea for the two leaders to meet and discuss their concerns soon.<br/><br/>With regard to Iran, the Israeli position, as I have previously mentioned, in the Mad Mullahs column, can easily accommodate itself to the policy which worked so well for the US and the USSR.

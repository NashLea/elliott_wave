They are all over the place, which would be admirable diversity in most libertarian settings, but gets in the way of appearing \"decisive\".  Not only did they NEVER really have a \"filibuster proof majority\" (it was only 60 if you ignored the fact that there are multiple factions, some more like the Reps than most other Dems), they could never even stop the Reps from doing whatever they pleased (e.g. Roberts and Alito) back in the Bush years when the \"Dems\" had 40+ votes in the Senate (like the Reps now) and thus had filibuster capability.<br /><br />The Reps on the other hand are these days like a brainwashed cult, in a lockstep march to whatever crazy song (or test) their crazy mouthpieces and leaders play.  You didn't think Bush was in control did you?  Remember his attempt to appoint his own Supreme Court justice?  Hah!  He did what he was told, just like all the other Reps.  Fanatics or fearful, they all look \"effective\", although a wooden stake will still kill them.

At the least,  it should not be surprising.  As a social libertarian, I am certainly not surprised or all that disappointed, although the dysfunction is getting pretty bad.  But you got a real solution?  I doubt it.<br /><br />Anyhow, the filibuster rule is just one that the Senate made for itself and is not in the Constitution.  They could junk it themselves tomorrow (but don't hold your breath).  It could and should be ended except: as bad as it is, I think at least a 60% vote approval requirement should be kept for any lifetime appointments (e.g. Supreme Court)  because we know now that the Reps are so unprincipled that they will put in extreme and crazy radicals in positions whenever they have 51 votes, and the Dems can't /won't stop them.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1149053, "replies": [], "lft": 166, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/snowed-in/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1549663, "rgt": 167, "userDisplayName": "Michael", "createDate": "1265839635", "userID": 46908845, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1265864930", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Texas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1265864930", "commentSequence": 105, "commentBody": "Term Limits.

Inflation is a great value leveler but it is also a cruel hoax for retirees.<br/>Right now, the major ongoing tool of stimulus has been to keep interest rates down. That has hammered persons who saved for retirement and are living off of their own savings. Those of us who try to balance fixed income assets with growth stocks have had our potential investment income hammered by the current economy. No one has any ability to offset this awful affect of an economic downturn but liberals like this author should periodically acknowledge that the largest hidden tax of deficit spending is in the near term, poor interest rate returns and in the long term, devaluation of savings in real purchasing power terms.

Because such austerity is exactly what conservatives like him hope to impose on the US. Fortunately, we have managed to largely avoid such austerity here in the US. In the wake of the economic collapse of 2008, President Obama and the Democrats managed to get a significant stimulus bill passed. And since then, the Administration has used every tool it could find (such as payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefit extensions) to continue some stimulus. The stimulus has been far from enough, largely because of GOP obstructionism, but our economy is slowly recovering, while Europe's is in a spiraling disaster thanks to austerity. <br/><br/>In Europe, the question is how much havoc will the disastrous austerity path inflict.

The total cost was calculated by summating those in the processes of adsorbent production, uranium recovery, and elution and purification. When the adsorbent performance increased from 2g-U/kg-adsorbent (ad) to 6g-U/kg-ad, the cost of each process decreased in the same way. The increment of adsorbent durability of 6 times to 60 times reduced the process cost of adsorbent production especially. In the current state of 2g-U/kg-ad and 6 times usage of adsorbent, the uranium from seawater cost 90,000yen/kg-U. The uranium cost becomes 25,000yen/kg-U in the promising performance of 4g-U/kg-ad and 18 times usage of adsorbent.

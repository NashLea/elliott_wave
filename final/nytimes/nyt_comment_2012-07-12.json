Once upon a time, nurses were stellar in eliciting the  little nuggets of information to differentiate the trivial from the serious and keep the MDs in line. Unfortunately,it seems this input which might have put the MD on alert and press the panic button was absent."}]}, "lft": 1596, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/nyregion/in-rory-stauntons-fight-for-his-life-signs-that-went-unheeded.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 6603593, "rgt": 1601, "userDisplayName": "sew quik", "createDate": "1342059907", "userID": 16241320, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1342066132", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1342062532", "commentSequence": 328, "commentBody": "Interesting how the focus of the comments (and the article) is on the vital signs and lab values. Very little focus by most of the MD commentators about the symptoms and absolutely no mention of the physical exam of the child in the ED regarding the leg. One reason I became a surgeon, and then a vascular surgeon, is the importance in my field of symptoms and the physical exam. While the lab values are obviously important in the assessment, two things strike me about this tragic case:<br/><br/>1) one phone call from the primary MD to the ER might have saved his life. When I send a patient to any ER, especially someone that calls me with symptoms and that I cannot pre-evaluate beforehand, I always call ahead and say \"I am sending Mr. XXX to your ER. He is en route. I am worried about aortic rupture/infection/bleeding/thrombosis, etc. Please evaluate him and have the ER doc call me on my cell phone.\" The most important surgical instrument in 2012 remains the cellular phone.<br/><br/>2) This story repeatedly states how much Rory's leg hurt. In the absence of a fracture and with a break in the skin, this is classic for a necrotizing soft tissue infection. It is not clear that anyone looked closely at his leg. Pain out of proportion to physical findings is also a sign of this. To often nowadays, we focus on the labs, the vitals, the \"sepsis checklist\" and we are not examining the patients with a focus on the affected areas. I doubt the exam was normal of his leg.

Acknowledging that these students want to become professional athletes is important. Acknowledging that few will succeed, and that those that do will have an early retirement, is even more important. I am not opposed to the idea of having \"performance\" majors for athletes, but I see several components as being critical:<br/>\u2022 Personal finance. If you are one of the lucky ones, you may suddenly be offered far more money than you've ever seen. Classes on managing money, considering your athleticism as a freelance consulting business, and financial planning would be an enormous benefit (the same is true for artists and musicians, who have been mentioned by others as comparable majors).<br/>\u2022 Post-athlete careers. It is no secret that athletes in virtually all sports peak young. Some student athletes have this in mind from day one, and plan accordingly. But many don't - what will you do with yourself after your sports career ends? Skills in business, management, coaching - these should be part of every athlete's undergraduate curriculum, especially those who want to become professional athletes.<br/>THis is a good discussion to have in higher education, but it must take on the realities of life AFTER sports for these students.

What you describe is not bipolar disorder, but rather sociopathy. Bipolar sufferers swing between extreme mood states and may be suicidal when in their depressive state, but they don't typically plot to inflict serious harm on others. Furthermore, bipolar sufferers don't manipulate their behavior based on environment (ie, behave one way in public and other way in private). Both of those traits ARE typical of sociopaths.<br/><br/>I'm also surprised that the psychiatrists you've consulted have not taken your concerns more seriously: What you describe in no way sounds like normal childhood acting out. And trained child psychs should realize that a child with sociopathic tendencies might well exhibit such contradictory traits in different settings. Perhaps it's your son's young age that precludes them from associating the behaviors you describe with a serious personality disorder. Perhaps you need to consult with a different type of specialist.<br/><br/>Finally, your post immediately brought to mind the movie The Bad Seed, which I happened to see again only recently. I would not claim that the movie represents a completely realistic clinical picture -- it's simplistic and melodramatic -- but it nonetheless has some psychiatric validity: A person who has no sense of right and wrong, who is adept at manipulating others and who creates a persona that seems not only normal but even sweet and charming. This is the definition of a sociopath. The movie is extreme in that in portrays these behaviors in so young a child. <br/><br/>Diagnosis at a distance is fraught with peril, even when made by those with good credentials, which I do not have. So I reiterate the suggestion that you seek out a child psychiatrist with experience in this area. At the very least, perhaps such a clinician can offer a new take on your son's condition.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3288040, "replies": [], "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/transcript-of-red-bulls-conference-call/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4782776, "rgt": 7, "userDisplayName": "Paul", "createDate": "1319859984", "userID": 34677113, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1319863056", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bellerose Terrace", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1319859456", "commentSequence": 3, "commentBody": "In the Hurricane Irene makeup, this team showed that they could, on their day, easily handle LA.

The problem is to get elected a candidate has to go where the money is and these days it isn't with ordinary folks.  Campaigns are entirely too long and expensive.  Obama would be a fool to try fight the system as it is in regard to lobbyists.  Feingold and McCain tried some tepid campaign reform but Roberts, Scalia and company shot that down.  Yes, our system is corrupt and in the last 2010 election corporations outspent unions by 4-1 and in my home state alone both the Chamber of Commerce as well as a single corporation outspent the 70,000 members of the Teachers' Union.  So what, exactly, is the point of this article?  Other than to paint Obama with a brush that you could use to color almost every candidate for high offices in this country.  And, yes, there is an unequal treatment of Obama by the media but what's new about that?  Who owns most of the media now?  Is it a real independent and objective source of information anymore?

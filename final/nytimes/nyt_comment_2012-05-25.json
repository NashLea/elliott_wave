But when i read the comments below(all of them), I quite agreed with these people too,the people who have worked in the industry on the other side. Some of the points raised by the author are acceptable while on some points, he seems to be biased. The newcomers are not as much efficient but they are not paid as much either. Also the firm doesn't do them a favor,it is finally going to receive their services. The company does spend time and money on the newcomers but in a lot of cases, the employees are also hooked by bonds,so finally the firm manages to get back what it invested over the period.<br/>\nThe Hierarchy is something that is seldom challenged and could not be until the environment is conducive to question asking and innovations.If in a firm, a particular work is done in a certain way and something that an individual suggests requires some \"inconvenient change\", then I think the author will agree it is most likely that the former will win.

Or maybe Egypt.  Thus all the problems you cite on Wall Street, or elsewhere, end up deriving from the same place.  Corruption.  It runs from the top, including most evidently or former President Bush and his side-kick Cheney, a Supreme Court which corruptly placed them at the pinnacle of US power, which they promptly abused.  There's plenty of evidence that 9/11 was not exactly unanticipated or undesired.  A war-by-lies followed.  And ended all on the crash of 2008.<br />Because of corruption, be it at Goldman Sachs or Moody's or at the NY Building inspector's office.  Corruption all around, in universities and health-care insurance companies and drug manufacturers.  Corruption as American as apple-pie.<br /><br />Oh, but we're not allowed to say that.

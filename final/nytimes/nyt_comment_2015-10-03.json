THAT call must be made by the umpire assigned to the base which the runner improperly ran from.<br/><br/>I think the no-tagging-up or tagging-but-leaving-too-soon (or some combination) scenarios would cover any quadruple play.<br/><br/>BUT, I wonder if this would count as well?  2 or 3 on, none out.  Count is 0-2.  Batter attempts a bunt at a ball below his knees, and misses, but also pulls his bat back. Umpire must rule on whether it was a swing; and if it was a swing, the umpire signals for an out.  But the catcher drops the ball OR fails to catch it before it hits the ground, so the ball is live and every batter/runner is free to run.

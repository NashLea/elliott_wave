By its very nature, making a call or using the phone to check emails or websites will always require no fewer than two providers, the overseas company \u2013 that you use there, and your home company \u2013 that bills you. To get mad at your local company is misdirecting your anger.<br/><br/>I have lived and travel overseas extensively for almost 20 years. I agree that services like Skype tend to be better than buying a local SIM when overseas. You tend to use wi-fi (which tends to be free from local 'hot spots') for access, then use Skype for transport to the country you\u2019re calling, and the local country\u2019s rates to terminate to the number you call. The article has an inaccuracy: it assumes that your call to phones will be around 2c/min. Not so. They will vary by country. For example, if you call a cell phone in Dublin, expect to pay almost 22c/min, in Dubai it will be closer to 28c/min, in Hanoi almost 34c/min. Count yourself lucky if you call a country and pay 2c/m.<br/><br/>Mobile calling on your phone is a paradox: the seller of service (the overseas telecom company) does not see, much less treat you as their customer, ever. You are transient prey, and there is no business case whatsoever for them to provide lower rates. Just the opposite exists; they see you as a 'red meat' revenue opportunity with enough barriers to prevent you moving to alternatives. Markups (the price you pay divided by the costs) are staggering; often more than several hundred percent for voice calls, and thousands of percent for text messages.

No magic pill. What was passed was nothing more than a joke on the American People. We must reduce spending, attrition alone will cut 3-5% per year.

Obviously the wealthiest will carry a larger portion of the burden.<br/>\nOur government should not be the largest employer. Security and safety should NOT be shelved, however ever dollar spent needs to be scurtinized and confirmed valid.<br/>\nAs a nation we have spent beyond our means. What sense does it make that we borrow  $0.42 per $1.00 spent. That is absurd. Live within our means and spend less than what we take in. Raising taxes will not resolve the issue until we cut the spending. If we were able to cut $3 dollars for every dollar raised in taxes that would be prudent and supported by the people. All this Congress and the the President did is act like they did something. I believe that defense can be cut by up to 30% without dire effects. This approach would be true for all departments and expenditures. As a people we must strat NOW to fix the problem, why wait another day to start.

The mayor's personal fortune based on his majority ownership in Bloomberg has doubled during his first seven years in office. It's nice that he's giving back a small amount of the fortune he's amassed but it's still a drop in the bucket. <br/><br/>It would be far more meaningful and productive if the mayor used his bully pulpit to push back against the banks that have foreclosed on so many homes and become an agent for sound financial policy. I'd like to see him stand up for a strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and meaningful derivatives reform. <br/><br/>Of course, the mayor will do none of these things because he's a businessman first, a politician second, and a philanthropist when it suits him.

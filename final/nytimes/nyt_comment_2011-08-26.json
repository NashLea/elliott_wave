All such programs have failed to generate the intended assistance to borrowers because they are NOT MANDATORY!! The lenders are taking care of their shareholders, and now that lending practices are safely tightened, most all the prey of the predatory lenders are prevented from escaping into more reasonable loans. There is no incentive or inducement so there is no action, while homeowners die on the vine and foreclosures drag values down. B.O.A., Chase, et al count their profits and sleep well in the meanwhile. Force lenders to clean up their toxic leavings. After all, who is more responsible: the laypeople who took these loans, or the financial professional class who wrote them? Who should have seen this coming?<br/>\n   As for the hackneyed saw about irresponsible borrowers who bought homes too expensive for their means, it doesn't take an enormous principal debt to put you under if your interest rate is 8, 9, say 10% or more. My own purchase was \"the cheapest house I've seen this year\" according to my realtor, but I'm still barely above water, thanks to usurious terms. I know I'm not alone in taking a bad loan as a \"bridge\" only to find the door slammed behind when it was time to re-fi, despite conscientious credit hygiene. And how about questioning instead the wisdom of cutting off access to re-finance by tightening lending criteria after all these terrible loans were already out there??<br/>\n   I am in vehemently, rabidly in favor of a blanket refi plan for all subprime loans because:<br/>\n1.

Liverpool's activities in the transfer market are a real puzzle to me. On several occasions since the window opened and King Kenny started flashing around all of those Red $ox bucks, I've been trying to engage Bakes, the most prominent Liverpool supporter who comments on this blog, but he refuses to weigh in. Jordan Henderson? And they've been playing him on the right wing, too. Charlie Adam is just about the same player as Stevie G is: a dead ball specialist who makes plays from the middle of the pitch and makes few tackles, most of which are ill-timed or badly executed. He absolutely can NOT play on the same pitch as Gerrard. And after considering the three guys I've mentioned, 'Pool still has no less than 10 more midfielders on the squad. And, unlike Arsenal, who tend to pick 'em on the green side, Liverpool looks to be shunting aside their young'uns, at least in the midfield. It looks like, other than Poulsen, for whom there obviously is neither want nor need, the bottom of the pecking order looks to be Spearing and Shelvey, the guys that they grew. And I don't get it, either, because in the preseason games that I saw, and from the end of last season, I see Spearing ahead of Lucas, whom I've never rated. But they have produced both Kelly and Flanagan as fullbacks. But Flanagan was responsible for not covering Larsson, allowing Sunderland to draw at Anfield. I rate Kelly ahead of Flanagan, and I might take either over the mortally overrated Glen Johnson. How long before the Kuyts and Meireles, who were the best players on the side, by far, last year, sour on playing behind Henderson and Downing, just because they're flavor of the week? Dissent derailed Man City two years ago, and contributed possibly to Chelsea's slump last season.

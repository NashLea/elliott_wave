Most of us have seen what rabid fear and hatred can do, as in the killing of many innocents in the 9-11 incidents, death threats against Salman Rushdie for his publication of a book not favorable to Islam, the intensely brutal slaying of Theo Van Gogh for his act of publishing cartoons ridiculing a prophet of Islam.<br/><br/>That is not to say any society or group is free of prejudices and hatred.   Something I do find in America which I love is the often irreverent humor and lampooning of just about every religion and certainly every politician.   Yet we tend to coexist well and acts of savage hatred related to criticism or loathing of religion are relatively rare.   <br/><br/>In listening to some enlightened voices in Muslim, as was seen in the Times last week with the publication of a picture of two women holding a sign condemning violence, I am heartened that many are awakening.   I am hopeful that leaders of Islam, though rightly offended by such a disrespectful and hateful video as recently appeared, will speak out for tolerance, understanding and forgiveness, and against endless and needless violence.", "recommendationCount": 83}, {"assetID": 3339753, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7169986, "replies": [], "commentID": 7170315, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Warren Howie Hughes", "createDate": "1348032350", "userID": 63739031, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1348032376", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Laszlo", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Quincy, Il.", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1348028776", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Da, Comrade Lasz, We Muscovite Dr. Shteyman back real soon, should it Don on us?<br/><br/>Howie"}]}, "lft": 38, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/ode-on-a-russian-urn/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7169986, "rgt": 41, "userDisplayName": "Laszlo", "createDate": "1348029400", "userID": 31827643, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1348029434", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Jackson Heights", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1348025834", "commentSequence": 6, "commentBody": "Wow!

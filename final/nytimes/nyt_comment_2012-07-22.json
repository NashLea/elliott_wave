It was nice that the writer mentioned a family in which the parents instructed their sons that they were expected to be charitable (e.g. \"give back\"). As a professional asker, I have met too many wealthy people whose values did not include being philanthropic and, as I tell students to whom I teach fundraising now, nothing any non-family member can say will convince them to be philanthropic if the family tree in which the money was earned and/or passed from generation to generation did not get joy from helping others. I still believe deeply that the wealthy (those in any income tax bracket higher than 28% and everyone who might ever pay the 15% capital gain tax rate, like Mr. Romney's family who pay only 15% because it's legal) can do so much more than they do, but that's my idealism at work.

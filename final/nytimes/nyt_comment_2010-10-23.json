I even had one woman friend try to trick me into getting it cut. She said that her hairdresser was doing free haircuts for women with long hair for a week.  I asked some questions and it sounded like it wouldn't be just a trim so I said no thanks. But my daughter (then around 18 and also with long hair that she was going to cut for Locks of Love) was interested in the deal.  Oh, suddenly my friend stopped replying to the e-mail.

Evan's knowledge of the various attractions brought them to life for us and he had scheduled the tours at times when the crowds were the smallest (a difficult task during the busy summer months). A friend recommended Evan as the perfect tour guide for Rome and he surpassed all of our expectations.

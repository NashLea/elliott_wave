It's easy to make fun of some of the responses that showed  readers who didn't understand what you wrote, or who are  a little na\u00efve.  But digital security is a serious issue indeed, and I think your readers are to be applauded, for wanting to take a measured and thoughtful approach to this issue.<br/><br/>I'm an I/T professional, and am generally an early and enthusiastic adopter of new technology, from the first Palm Pilots,to on-line banking and stock trading,to the iPad and iPhone.  I'm currently going paperless in my office using a Fujitsu ScanSnap, and I've used Carbonite for off-site backup for years, and highly recommend their service.  I do \"get it\".  But I also have reservations about the password vault concept, especially when a user's full name, address, and other information useful for identity theft  are in the vault.  Yes, there's no risk if everything works as designed . . . but in my experience that doesn't always happen.   Obviously, you feel strongly otherwise, and that's fine.  My real point is just that serious, thoughtful people can see this issue differently . . . and accusing your readers of being paranoid Luddites if they disagree with you . . . doesn't do much to expand the communications channel.", "recommendationCount": 20}, {"assetID": 3373361, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 9190195, "replies": [], "commentID": 9191845, "trusted": 1, "userDisplayName": "Carolyn Egeli", "createDate": "1370787103", "userID": 62499561, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1370787126", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Tim Kane", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Valley Lee, Md.", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1370783526", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Our elites caused WWI, WWII, Korea, Viet Nam, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc, etc, and actually all of them before WWi too.

He lays out the situation clearly: left no dark corners. Moreover, he concludes the speech with this assesment: that if Hitler succeeds, a new dark age would emerge in Western Civilization, but if England succeeds, then a new golden age would emerge. With those stakes, he was able to summon his nation's courage, their \"finest hour\" - thus labeling an age. I get goose bumps every time I read it, because we all know that a new very dark age had already settled over Europe yet we know that the English did summon their courage, that they did succeed, that as a result a new golden age, in fact history's golden-est of golden ages, the post war boom which doubled global economic output in less than 30 years did indeed occur.

Circulating money around makes the economy work.  Hoarding money on a large scale has no impact other than removing some circulation money.  And that's an impact anyway.<br/><br/>The issue today is too much money is going to the very top before it circulates through the economy.  Rather than after.  And even then it's still too much going to the top.<br/><br/>And fewer people at the top still get way more in dollars of other peoples money than the small trickle down we've seen now for 30 yrs.  More than is spent on SNAP and other assistance programs for the poorer folk goes to the wealthiest in all sorts of forms.<br/><br/>Many times in the past the government has dealt with depressions.  And they created jobs - the CCC is one of the best known when inflation rates were high and people had no jobs.  A similar approach could be taken today but that's just plain old socialism to the gop mindset.<br/><br/>Where are all Boehners JOBS, JOBS, JOBS that was their main campaign focus in 2010?

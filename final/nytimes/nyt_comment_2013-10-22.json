I read an article in a San Francisco newspaper where a couple of people were complaining about paying MORE for health insurance.  One reported paying nearly $10,000 more per year for a family of four.  I checked on the California exchange, and if this person was telling the truth (which I doubt), it would mean that he had been getting an individual policy for his family of four for $325 per month prior to the PPACA.  Frankly, if that were really true, it certainly must have been a high-deductible policy that didn't cover squat.  As Ezra Klein over at Wonk blog has pointed out, many that claim to pay more are comparing apples to oranges.  After all, how can you compare a high-deductible policy with all sorts of exclusions to a comprehensive policy that covers everything?  Or worse, what about those policies that were sold with a lifetime cap of $50,000 or $75,000?  I have no idea what a person who actually got sick under that type of coverage was supposed to do--after all, the inadequacy of such caps would not become evident until a person actually got sick.

I attended an Ivy League college (Columbia) with an insatiable desire to learn, not to make money.

Columbia gave me a full-ride Charles Hayden Memorial Scholarship, for which I will always be grateful.  Then, in my freshman year, I was bowled over by Columbia's Core Curriculum, which has nothing to do with vocational training but provided a breath-taking view of the civilization into which I had been born, one which has formed the core of my subsequent experiences, my intellectual life, and my professional achievements. The totality of my educational experiences was more than useful, it was exhilarating. The thudding mediocrity of students who plod through college to \"get a job\" is alien not only to the creative mind, but the civilized sensibility.  Yes, upon completion of my doctorate, a publishing contract in hand, I landed my first job on the faculty of one of America's top universities, and I began my adult life not with a \"job,\" but with an intoxicating sense of adventure.

I was a straight-A student all through school.  Once I realized that perfect attendance was not always the ultimate goal, I used to take days off every once in a while, especially in middle school.  My mom was quite nice about allowing me to take days when I was feeling vaguely 'sick' or 'stuffy.'  I forgot about doing so throughout high school, college, my master's program, and the first two years of my PhD when my goal was to be the 'perfect student.'  Now that I am researching and writing my dissertation, I often have to take mental health days to maintain my sanity.   It took me (with the help of some friends) a while to convince myself that it was OK that I did this.  Now I am the biggest advocate for such days.<br /><br />Throughout my long grad school journey, I have found that my worst critic is myself.  I am not just speaking academically, but also in my social interactions and in my hobbies.  I always want everything to go perfectly all the time.  I am a pretty laid back person about what other people do, but I expect a lot from myself.  I am pretty certain that my mother recognized my tendency towards perfectionism from an early age and she was able to provide the space for me to take a day off.  Ever since I left home for college, when I return home, she has a new book (fiction) waiting for me to hide in my room and read.  She does not care if I spend time with her, but she wants me to relax when I am home.  She has never told me this, but she knows.

First, the best evidence so far is that the outcome of this election did not reflect changes in preference by Wisconsin voters, but differences in turnout. The turnout in wealthy suburban counties was way up, but down in urban areas. The urban vote still went for Feingold by a substantial margin. Turnout was down by young people who support Democrats disproportionately. 36 percent of Wisconsinites identify themselves as conservatives.  The rest are either moderates or liberals. More Wisconsinites still identify themselves as Democrats than as Republicans. The data showing about equal spending by both candidates refer to the candidates' own campaigns, not the secretly financed \"independent\" groups whose ads in my experience were overwhelmingly anti-Feingold. Right wing and Republican groups flooded the state with advertising because both the senate seat and the governor were up for election. Johnson appeared as a gentle, soft-spoken person who was extremely vague on many issues, is definitely conservative, but cannot be compared to the likes of Angle and O'Donnell. Feingold discouraged advertising by outside groups which favored him whereas Johnson enouraged outside spending. The Wisconsin outcome is directly comparable to other North Central states like Minnesota and Michigan. Feingold had the misfortune to have to run in an election where anti-incumbency was paramount. He most likely would have won at any other time. This election shows nothing about the long-term situation in Wisconsin. It was probably a fluke, and the state will probably revert to its norm in the next election.<br /><br />More:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/106645623.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jsonline.com...</a>", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 2038680, "replies": [], "lft": 594, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/us/politics/05feingold.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2794561, "rgt": 595, "userDisplayName": "EdwB", "createDate": "1288923586", "userID": 32082650, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1288933286", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Singapore", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1288929686", "commentSequence": 274, "commentBody": "If it's true that Republicans win when voter turn out is low, can there ever be a mandate for Republican ideas?

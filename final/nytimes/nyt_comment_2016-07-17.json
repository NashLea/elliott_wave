I seriously doubt he had anything to do with this so called coup attempt. This reeks of a set up. It all worked out so well for Erdogan and reminds one of the 1933 bombing of the Reichstag which provided Hitler with the ability to take control of the gov't completely, purging anyone who had stood against him. That said, I would agree that the US has an abysmal history of supporting military coups and I'm glad we did not this time, in spite of the fact that I believe the whole thing was orchestrated by Erdogan.

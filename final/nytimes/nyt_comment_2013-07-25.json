Anyway folks, I live in Hawaii, put up with boom boxes in the middle of the night, homeless people in the parks and harbors, anywhere there is running water and a toilet. And then there is Waikiki.

But you<br/>could find the same social defeat and problems in Bangor, Maine, or in a smaller, rural village. What is the common denominator? Wages, that give people a sense of value and purpose, a future even kids may want.<br/>Even if it is in public service, that Right wing battered \"socialism.\"  Cuba<br/>is a decent study for ourselves.Kids will steal for sneakers.

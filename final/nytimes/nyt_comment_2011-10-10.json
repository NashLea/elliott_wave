But in this case, the effort to capture must be made, and if resisting, can be shot and killed as last resort is the law, as excercised by FBI and local law officials not preyed and killed for the sake of killing as done in this case as well as with OBL. So in this case, it is premeditated murder or assasination of a fellow american fugitive in a foreign land.. Its just more and more proof of the thinking of Obama and his lack of respect of a law, which he seems to be twisting to anyway he likes..he obviously has no respect to the American way or thinking..I am now more convinced deep inside, he hates Ameerica..", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3285002, "replies": [], "lft": 1208, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/middleeast/secret-us-memo-made-legal-case-to-kill-a-citizen.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4667097, "rgt": 1209, "userDisplayName": "AKLady", "createDate": "1318197748", "userID": 60702192, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1318219781", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "AK", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1318216181", "commentSequence": 522, "commentBody": "Section 349(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1481(a)(5)) is the section of law that governs the ability of a United States citizen to renounce his or her U.S. citizenship.<br/><br/>Awlaki was not a U.S. Citizen.

They do good things, enable massive productivity increases, and make modern life possible.  That said, the interests of corporations and the interests of ordinary people aren't the same.  Corporations are interested in maximizing profit and minimizing costs (which means they like minimal wages, no environmental protections, no labor protection, etc), while people want a decent working environment and a decent life and a feeling that their children will be better off than they were.  That also means corporations want minimal taxes and minimal safety net, while people want a solid safety net and the taxes that prevent massive accumulation of wealth.<br/><br/>Corporate oligarchy is not a good system to live under.  It's not a system I want to live under.

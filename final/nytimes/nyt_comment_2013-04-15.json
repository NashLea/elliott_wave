I was a Bronx ADA from 1/94 to 1/97. SAA is right.

My memory has clouded, but I recall 40k docketed arrests in 1994.  That number increased at least 10k per year each year I was there.  Which, if I my memory is correct, means that the number of cases shoehorned into the system doubled in the '90s with no corresponding increase in resources to deal with them.  From '94 to '97, while the amount of new cases skyrocketed, I saw no increase in judges, courtrooms, jurors, clerks, CO's, inmate buses, or defense lawyers.

And the only basis for the eviction is that they are \"older residents\" who have more bedrooms than people in their family. <br/><br/>I get it: there is wasted space that could be put to better use.

People who use Airbnb probably aren't interested in staying in the NYCHA housing projects!!! If the rooms are being legitimately rented out for roommate situations, however, what's the problem with that?

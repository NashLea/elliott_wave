Here's my answer to the exam question.  First, for workers, especially low wage workers, the kind who are more likely to increase output rather than more efficiently produce the current output, are constrained with a zero-lower bound for wages, which is known as autonomous consumption.  So wages for minimal low wage workers (Minimal Wage), given autonomous consumption and their level of debt, has set their aggregate Minimal Wage level at a price higher than market-equilibrium wage that would clear the labor market.  <br/><br/>The result is that worker are unemployed and surviving on transfer payments.  And eliminating or even reducing transfer payment, both money and in-kind, would take workers and the unemployed below their Minimal Wage/income levels, resulting in privations, social disorder, and even death.  Also, as you note, supra, eliminating the transfer payment would only further weaken demand, increasing unemployment, and further decreasing real GDP.  So the price of labor isn't worng; it is simply at the zero-lower bound of autonomous consumption and fixed debt, i.e., the Minimal Wage-Income level.<br/><br/>But, as Keynes demonstrated more than 80 years ago, the demand-side constraint is at negative real interest rates, so it too is at zero-lower bound for interests rates, because money to increase output won't earn a sufficient risk-adjusted positive return.  So that price is also correct.  The solution, as Keynes revealed is . . .

Deficit spending requires borrowing on the open market, and so soaks up money as various investors purchase the increase in treasury bills.  The normal effect (without Fed intervention, quantitative easing) is that as more money is taken up by government, interest rates will then *rise* relative to what they would have been.   Of course, as you should know, Fed quantitafive easing did not happen before or during the housing bubble of 2000-2007.  So if federal deficit spending in 2002-2005, during the heart of the bubble inflation tended to naturally raise interest rates, then why did rates in fact generally trend *down* during the federal deficit spending of 2002-2005?<br/><br/>Simple.

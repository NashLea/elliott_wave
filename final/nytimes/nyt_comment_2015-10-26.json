The gurus used to name the disciples even. One such disciple was named \" Lowly \". He was a very wise and helpful student but was very unhappy with his name. He requested his guru to change the name. The guru asked him to visit a few villages and then return.<br/><br/>One day while walking in a village he happened to see some people carrying a dead person. He asked a person about the name of the dead person. Promptly he got the reply as \" Life \". He asked the other person as to how a person named \" Life \" can die. That person replied that everyone has to die one day whether a person is named \" Life \"or \" Death \".<br/><br/>In another village he saw a lady beating a girl. He asked the lady for beating the girl. The lady told that the girl was her slave and that she asked her to earn some money but she didn't. \" Lowly  \" paid her some money and requested her not beat her and told her that the girl would surely earn some other day.

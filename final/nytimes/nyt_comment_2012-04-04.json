The organs are inside, and identifying future roos from hens is like guessing whether you're looking at a penis or a finger on a 6-week ultrasound.<br/><br/>Mother Earth News, My Pet Chicken, and other places have chicken picking programs that are good for selecting breeds for laying, meat, and broodiness.<br/><br/>And may I recommend my own blog?  I'm behind on updating on our first year with chickens, but I will be explaining everything we did wrong, what we did right, and how to do things like build a mobile chicken coop (\"tractor\" in poultry lingo) to protect your birds and still let them eat fresh grass every day.

I feel sorry for dog in the backyard waiting for something to do all the time.  Play with a dog an hour, and the dog will wonder why not all the time.  Chickens are fine all day by themselves.  We get eggs everyday and give many to neighbors who might hear them on occasion and consider calling the city (some are allowed but there are restrictions).  Neighbors also tend to them while we are gone. For awhile if we did not get them put up by dusk they would fly up into a tree.  I left them up there a few times until a raccoon got some.  Now we nudge them out of the tree if necessary (of late they go to \"bed\" by themselves). You better have a lock of sorts that a raccoon cannot figure out -- we had that problem too.  The chicks cost $2.  You know what my vet bill is if a chicken gets sick or something? $2. In this city people spend thousands on various issues that dogs and cats have.  These pets are easy and pay for themselves.  They can be noisy on occasion but usually less than 15 minutes.  Kids love to play with them and get the eggs everyday.  I know rats and mice will come for the food but that is not different than any other outside pet who is fed outside.  (A rooster is not required to have eggs by the way.)  We have not had a hawk attack yet, but we saw one once.  If it gets one I might put up some fishing line or some such to spook it away and maybe replace the chicken for $2.

If the dollars were spent  to encourage and allow reasoned arguments, I would agree with Mr. Douthat's analysis.

Sadly, in that same real world, history tells us that such ads work.<br/><br/>How often was there an obvious correlation of a candidate's vote total to the amount of dollars spent?  And what kind of democracy is that?<br/><br/>Admittedly, in the GOP primary races one candidate began with vastly more resources and would have won more easily but for some Super-PACs closing the gap; leveling the financial playing field (if only a little).  But if this primary season represents Ross Douthat's idea of a healthy political process, count me in dissent.<br/><br/>Still in the real world, I accept that Adelson, Freiss, the Koch brothers and others will always have more influence and power than guys like me with my $30,000 gross annual income.  I'm okay with that.  I am not okay with the gross perversion of the political process in which election results are so blatantly for sale, whether to corporations or individuals. <br/><br/>Citizens United did not infect an otherwise pure and disease-free system.

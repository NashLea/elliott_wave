My husband and I are not the only middle class family staying in the city and planning to use the public school system (we live in Boston, contrary to my out of date profile). We decided that public transportation and a walkable, vibrant  community were more important than a large house and a yard--in fact, I really could care less about those two things so I don't consider it a sacrifice (especially since we live near several parks). So while this article may not apply to you because you can't image living in an apartment or condo, and you think only billionaires can live in the city, please realize that there is a growing portion of the middle class that is putting community above America's ridiculously oversized houses and property--and who are choosing to support urban public school systems."}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10431502, "replies": [], "commentID": 11970911, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "hcat", "createDate": "1402096864", "userID": 57927031, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1402102899", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "SDK", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "the OC", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1402099299", "commentSequence": 11970911, "commentBody": "And if we had a good voucher and tax credit program, families could live in the city and have a diversity of educational options.

It seems to me that the root of the problems Europe is having is that by having a common currency, there are no market forces to counter abuses and excesses of individual states.  If Greece had its own currency, then its profligate spending would have caused their currency to be grossly devalued triggering hyperinflation.  If Germany had its own currency, then its massive trade surplus would have greatly increased the value of its currency, causing its goods to rise in price and reduce its surplus.  Also, by having one common currency, Germany can force its austerity policy onto other nations.  <br/><br/>I'm certainly no expert in global economics, but if capital is flowing into Germany, then it can't flow into the depressed economies where it can be used to stimulate demand and investment.  <br/><br/>It appears believing that spending less and hoarding capital will stimulate growth, has gripped Europe just as it has here in the US.  Battling the evil debt monster has kept the US in a terribly weakened state and it's crushed Europe.  How much more evidence is required to convince leaders that austerity is not stimulative?  If their trade balance continues to grow, there wont be anyone in Europe with enough money to buy the German exports.  Then Europe will be continuously depressed, reinforcing our continuous weakness.  Economies operate upon demand.  Supply is created in response to demand.

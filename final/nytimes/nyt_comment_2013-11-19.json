Of course, blacks suffered the prevailing racism of their times, but they were far more equal under the law and were not anybody's property.  Nova Scotia's history shows underperformance of blacks but it does not put it out of place in the North American context.<br/><br/>Canada's black population has never been as large as the United State's but it's minority populations is significant in size and influence.  Fully 1/6th of the Canadian population is foreign born and the only primarily white countries of the top ten sources are the US, UK and France.<br/><br/>As for prominent blacks in Canadian history, the \"Father of British Columbia\" was governor (1850-60s) Sir James Davis.

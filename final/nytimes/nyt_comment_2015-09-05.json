As a professional broadcaster, I am especially sensitive to the noise levels in the places I dine and often surprised at the ambivalence of the restaurant owners to the music that is played in their carefully planned venues. More often than not, the music is chosen by the 20 somethings in the kitchen or behind the bar. Or in the case of one well-established restaurant in Newport Beach which was playing 70's power rock, loudly, in a room filled with 60 and 70 something's, the waiter said, when asked, \"Yeah, we're trying to get a younger demographic in here.\" My response was, \"Yeah but, they can't hear you in here.\" Go ahead and design a hyper-modern space for serving food, utilizing metal, glass and concrete, but take 1% of your build-out budget and address acoustics &amp; music selection; as we say in radio, daypart appropriate music - music that fits what people are doing at that time of day. The music should change from lunch to dinnertime. Finally, restaurant critics, please pay more attention in your reviews to these deal breaking details and ancillary parts of the food/dining experience. As we all know, the food on the plate can be the best culinary experience of a lifetime, an experience easily ruined by an incompetent or surly waiter, or a driving BTO (Bachman-Turner Overdrive) song.

Conservative ideology, liberal ideology, all ideologies are for those who will never be negatively impacted by the consequences of their implementation. National elections are a sewer of corruption. Dishonest, duplicitous, and deceitful career politicians and their political parties have turned government into an elite welfare system for themselves and their rich donors. We need politicians who have accomplished something in life besides reelection to public office. We need politicians who are public servants not self-serving. We need senators, representatives, and presidents who are pragmatic problem solvers for the American people. Together, let us clean up the sewer of corruption that is government today. Stop voting for self-serving parties, ideological issues, or pretentious personalities and instead cast a vote for change by voting against all incumbents until term limits are enacted. Only by disconnecting the word \u201ccareer\u201d from the word \u201cpolitician\u201d can we change America.", "recommendationCount": 18}, {"assetID": 3437159, "replies": [], "lft": 622, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/us/politics/talk-in-gop-turns-to-a-stop-donald-trump-campaign.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 15999985, "rgt": 623, "userDisplayName": "Mo M", "createDate": "1441422755", "userID": 68260433, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1441426143", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Newton, Ma", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1441422543", "commentSequence": 15999985, "commentBody": "I love that Donald Trump with his plain speaking and lack of need for funders has upset the Republican apple cart.<br/>So many of the Republicans have been blocking Obama's agenda for the last years, and quite frankly doing nothing to care for the American people.

If you believe that the right AND left are extreme, you are sadly lost.  If both sides were, as you think, lost in the extremes, then political life would be moving along comfortably right in the middle.  The reality is that is not at all true.  Why?  Because the right is lost in the extreme and there is no comparable left at all. Do a little reading and maybe you'll find out what left wing ideology is; it is mostly a focus on economic issues.  And on those issues, the what passes for the \"left\" in this country is just compassionate conservatism.  No, because we live in an oligarchy, the political battlefield left to us is the field of social issues.  On those issues, the difference is simple:  Forward-thinking v.

Trump is single handedly bringing the GOP into the current, while the Democrats will remain in the past.

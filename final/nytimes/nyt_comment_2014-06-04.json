For some people, I have no doubt that writing is the best way for them to absorb and process information, especially children just learning their letters for the first time. For most people who grew up with computers, any loss of temporary memory is rectified by an ability to take more notes that are often clearer after lectures than handwritten notes. While the brain may not register the information in the same way, the ability to pull up the information later as you study is invaluable. Technology comes with trade-offs, and it is too soon to say whether handwriting can be safely eliminated about learning basic writing - and no school that I know of (as an education policy analyst) is planning on doing that.

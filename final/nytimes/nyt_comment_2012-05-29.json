Doctors can no longer spend time listening to patients and doing a thorough medical exam. They can no longer order tests that  they think are needed. I blame the insurance companies. I do. <br/><br/>Your best bet is to listen to your own body telling you what is wrong.  Chest pain needs worked up.  Fatique that is sudden and unrelenting needs worked up. Shortness of breath that is new needs attention. Changes in your bowel habits or any black stool---needs worked up. Back pain that cannot be explained and continues needs an MRI. Too many of my cancer patients had back pain that was dismissed.  You know when something seems wrong.  Don't be an alarmist, but when it continues to nag at you that is when you should have it checked out. <br/><br/>Small moles that were mentioned in another post that were removed, well, better safe than sorry.

The elected judiciaries in most states are often of much lower quality than federal appointed judges, especially, as in Texas, if they run as Republicans or Democrats.  Granted, being \"electorally accountable\" does not necessarily mean being directly elected  2.  Giving legislatures more power is frightening.  The caliber of these people is getting lower and lower, and they are getting more partisan and corrupt.  3. More direct democracy is also scary.  California is a perfect example as to why initiatives are a really bad idea.  (For one, they have totally been captured by special interests, and often contradictory measures are passed.)  If we had non-gerimandered districts where moderates and centrists had some chance of winning elections, that could go a long way to fix things.  That would be a great constitutional amendment.   4. An amendment to fix the primary presidential primary system would also be of large benefit.  I don't know exactly how that could be done, but I do know we have a crazy way of selecting presidential candidates, including after finally getting the nominees then having them lambast each other for six months through all sorts of media.

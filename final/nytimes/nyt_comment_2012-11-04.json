Rasmussen is represented in the model most recently by their 28 Oct poll, which had Romney up 2, although the weight was lowered (probably due to the time elapsed since the poll was taken).<br/><br/>If the Ohio results from the model had included the 3 Nov Rasmussen poll, presumably with a somewhat higher weight since the results were \"fresh\", the outcome would have been a bit WORSE for Romney, not better.<br/><br/>The other state mentioned in the blog text as having a fresh Rasmussen poll is Michigan (where I live); it has Obama up 5, which is in line with most of the other recent polls taken here.<br/><br/>Michigan, of course, is not widely considered to be \"in play\" at the national level, although the Romney campaign is running quite a bit of advertising here (I live in the middle of the state, too far from the Ohio border for our local TV market to reach, and our senate race looks pretty safe for the Democratic incumbent, so my best guess is that the Romney campaign and associated PACs have so much money that they don't know what else to do with it).", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 3346440, "replies": [], "lft": 92, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/opinion/sunday/douthat-a-time-for-voters-to-choose.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 7563822, "rgt": 93, "userDisplayName": "Rita", "createDate": "1352001824", "userID": 47349721, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1352001956", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1351998356", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "  Mr. Douthat asserts that a vote for Mr. Romney means a future \"where we at least try to make the fiscal adjustments...\".  But  Mr. Romney has not told us, in any detail, what those fiscal adjustments will be and how they will improve the economy.  He evades providing details because he fears that he will lose part of his base and because he knows that what he has been peddling will not work.  If the best argument for Mr. Romney is that he might try to make fiscal adjustments, then the case for Mr. Romney has not been made.  When a candidate offers little or no details or shifts the details (e.g. limiting deductions to $17,000, $25,000 or whatever Congress says), this is a candidate who is asking us to make a leap of faith in voting for him and trust him.  But who do you trust, the liberal-leaning governor of Massachusetts, the ruthless financier at Bain Capital, the severe conservative of the primaries or the genial centrist of the last month?

I live on the soundfront, and I cannot stick a shovel in the ground within 75 feet of the shoreline without a permit.

Of course, grandfathering has perpetuated some structures, but if they are damaged more than 50% in a storm they cannot be replaced.<br/><br/>I don't know whether NY or NJ has a coastal management law, but such an approach to coastal development can be most helpful.

The regulatory regime has virtually universal support except among development interests that can't see the big picture.<br/><br/>Of course, many serious issues arise, such as property taking and other constitutional questions.

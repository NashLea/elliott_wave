After being awarded the peace prize, however, Liu would need a lot more courage and a better judgement to not be used as a pawn by some interest groups  that do not see themselves benefit from a peaceful relationship between the West and China.<br /><br />Talking about world peace, it is really hard to deny the fact that the Chinese government, however unpopular it appears, has done a tremendous peace-enhancing job in integrating the Chinese economy with the world.

I doubt the Prize will raise awareness of his works or bring him celebrity like in the case of Dalai Lama.  Rather it will only make him more of an enemy in the eyes of Chinese authorities, and even bring about jealousy among the \"fellow pro-democracy activists\" as we hear some of them already are protesting his prize. Sadly, Liu will likely never get to enjoy the Prize as much as Obama and others. But undoubtedly he will be more grateful for acknowledgement of his struggle.<br /><br />That said, this prize is nothing more than expression of moral guilt of the West for neglecting Chinese democracy until now. Iraq, terrorism, climate change has occupied the minds liberal activists for those years. For the last decade, China has quietly built up its economy with cooperation from the West. It is even foolishly admired by some intellectuals as the counterweight to the American \"hyperpower\". It is even hyped by the business elite as the next great market. Where was the Nobel Prize back then when everyone was enjoying the bubble economy backed by chinese money? The world enthusiastically cheered China's ascendancy during the Olympics. Only when the global economies faltered and massive unemployment in the west started to direct anger and criticsm toward china, the tide turned against China and the Nobel prize committeee considered a common man  Chinese dissident like Liu Xiabo.<br /><br />The Prize is years late.  If you look at the difference in the US economy and China's economy, China's authoritarian rulers can claim victory in that their system is the best and most efficient. They have already convinced their population that democracy is likely not needed. The Prize is just a temporary headache as China knows that Western leaders will give in to their demands just like Japan acquiesed to their pressure in the recent fishing dispute.

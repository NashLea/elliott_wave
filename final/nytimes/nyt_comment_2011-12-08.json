Notably, Rebeck fails to portray -- to come even close to portraying -- the metaphysics, the spirituality of art making or inspirational teaching.  Instead she has chosen to keep the text and events on a very surface, slapstick, predictable, juvenile level no different from what you'll find on tv sitcoms any night of the week.

This terrific production is consistently hilarious. And what depth to the cast--from the leads Wiest and Turtorro to supporting players Daniel Davis, Juliet Rylance, Josh Hamilton, Michael Urie, Alvin Epstein (who played Lucky in the Broadway premier of \"Waiting for Godot\" in the mid 1950s!!!), and most especially Roberta Maxwell who again takes a small role and makes a gem of it, But most of all, this production is a trenchant comment on the 1% with all the money and the absurdity of their lives--whether the old money or the new money. Such great work from everyone. It was a joy to be in the theatre.

We are on a slippery slope.  I think we're well into the SIGINT strategy with big computing (with better algorithms) and data, that is even bigger than the capabilities in the Poindexter days.  It's too tempting to mine all the data and too difficult to control those who do.<br/><br/>I was just trying to remind the NSA that \"it takes a village\" and that in order to verify the statistical classifiers (associate them with real terrorists) it takes real spies.  I was fortunate to have a brief conversation with William Colby a long time ago when I was in college.  He recognized the SIGINT/HUMINT dichotomy.  Then, SIGINT was satellites.  I think the NSA is incorrectly driven totally to the SIGINT side, but we'll never know :-).  Given the new DNI post, everyone is supposed to talk now, again a :-) to that.<br/><br/>Maybe the NSA could make a business out of this.  I'm looking for a refrigerator, and it's actually difficult given the models and ratings.  Were the NSA to know that, they'd have *real* data on all of the people who bought refrigerators, not just the Amazon, Sears, Lowe's or Home Depot reviews.  One day I'd get an anonymous email from the NSA service, \"We have found that the refrigerator that most people are really happy with is the Eisenkuehler 1500\".<br/><br/>The service would be free.

Gaining human intelligence is valuable but very difficult (think of the John le Carre novels).  SIGINT is a promise that removes the uncertain dependence on HUMINT by using assumed reliable computational algorithms.<br/><br/>HUMINT can point to individuals who are actual terrorists.  At that point, using face recognition algorithms would be useful in tracking that particular person who is a verified suspect.  If the NSA is thinking that only data-driven analysis (pure statistics, sans boots-on-the-ground intelligence) can save the day, they're naive, but also are lead into the very controversial intelligence activities that congress is now forced to restrict.  But no one would forbid the NSA from tracking a real suspect (well, maybe the most extreme Libertarian).<br/><br/>Data-driven approaches involve collecting *all* the data and then looking for anomalies within that data.  The NSA must have sold that to congress, notably back in the days of Adm. Poindexter's \"Prism\" project.  Members of congress are not capable of understanding the nature of the HUMINT approach which is like a model of terrorism, and the SIGINT data-driven approach and its political consequences.

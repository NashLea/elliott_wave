I buy them dried for 99 cents a pound at Lebanese food stores. They are so tolerant of cold you can plant them by pulling back the snow and even in Michigan can grow outdoors from April to November. From one to 12 inches tall the leaves are delicious raw in salads and sandwiches. Taller than that and the leaves are large enough for cooking like any green similar to spinach. When the pods first appear before the beans form they can be cooked like green beans. A week or two after that and the pods with small beans are great grilled with olive oil and salt, ten minutes a side eaten whole for a smoky edamame type treat. When the beans are mature but fresh they can be grilled in the shell for popping out, or popped out to eat raw on french bread with butter and maybe a thin slice of fresh garlic and salt. Fresh green favas are an excellent shell bean, perhaps best in brodo, just simmered in chicken broth with a grating of parmesan and a little parsley. Finally, of course, full circle to dried form, they are excellent boiled and mashed with garlic, olive oil, lemon and parsley as foul medemmes, a hummus type breakfast mash to have with pita bread. Favas come in large, medium and small varieties. I prefer to grow the small ones as the beans do not need to have the skin peeled before eating, as with the medium and large varieties. Almost no pests or diseases bother them (although you can grow them as a catch crop to distract june bugs from your other crops - favas can withstand an avalanche of june bugs and still survive and produce a crop) and they are tolerant of all the cold and heat that Michigan spring, summer and fall can throw at them. Just beware that some people are genetically predisposed to favism and cannot eat them without getting sick, so eat only a small amount the first few times till  you are certain  you can tolerate them.

On the point of working for free, we are excited to be testing with a small group to see how to tackle the incentive/gamification issue and make the project as interesting as possible to all parties. The reason we chose to reach out to our social media followers is that we found our followers to be some of the most engaged photography enthusiasts and with the sheer numbers could bring immense value to the Magnum archive and allow us to carry on the legacy of documentary photography. We, in no way wish to exploit rather we want to foster engagement in an industry that has suffered a huge blow in recent years. Magnum is not immune, but we truly believe Magnum must remain an active participant in the conversation of photojournalism and a relevant partner in stimulating this discourse.

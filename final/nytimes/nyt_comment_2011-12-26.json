These are pollutants such as cadmium, arsenic, hydrogen flourides hydrogen chlorides, etc. the regulation of which is long overdue. <br/><br/>Second, these rules will be a benefit not only to public health, but also to the economy, as they will require the installation of controls of coal fired power plants throughout the country.  Such pollution controls cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, and require hundreds of skilled laborers to install. That means the creation of good paying, mostly union jobs over the next 3-5 years. <br/><br/>Finally, these rules will finally help trigger the retirement of some aging coal units that were built in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, yet are still operating without pollution controls.  And that, in turn, will open up space for cleaner forms of energy - wind, solar, energy efficiency, combined heat and power, etc. - to gain a larger foothold in the energy system. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a real win for public health, the economy, and the environment.

While interference with the electrical systems on a plane has always seemed dubious to me, you also need to consider the problems that cell phones, iPads and Kindles can create for the cellular systems on the ground.   <br/><br/>While unintentional radiation isn't likely to be an issue for the planes (as your testing has shown), many of these devices are intentional radiators as well.   That means they have a cellular radio that communicates with base stations on the ground.    Aside from these radios creating a LOT greater interference threat for the electrical systems on the plane, the cellular networks on the ground could also be impacted.   Cell phones, iPads and Kindles in airplanes, could potentially interfere with the cell phone networks on the ground with which they are trying to communicate, and it is for this reason that I thought the FCC had raised concerns.

Becuase, they know beforehand, that if they will be in problem some political groups will come forward and save them.That is well established fact too! I am a priyanka chopra fan and I am not alone. I got offended when somebody wrote something bad about her and publish her dirty pictures. Will govt or court ban all those- just because it hurt the sensibilities of all Priyanka Chopra fans? Or govt/ court is waiting to see riots on the street by priyanka chopra fan to take a decision. There should be some logic. A secular state should not bow down to such organised criminal groups!

She replied with her own: \"Economics has basically become little more than applied mathematics.\"<br/><br/>In 79-82 roughly the period you describe, I was a wet behind the ears undergraduate studying econ geography in the Geog dept at the Univ of Arizona. One of their top guys in Economic Geography was Gordon Mulligan, from UBC. I remember quite vividly in my 1st class with him stating things in which I had no idea of the context: \"In the field of Economic Geography there is at least more openness to various ideas.\" Implying that intellectually speaking Economics itself, perhaps his true interests, had been sown shut. Later he went on to mock Milton Friedman a bit ...\"Uncle Miltie says...\"<br/><br/>At the time I had no idea about the subtext but I too was frustrated in how conceptually narrow the economics I was being taught in my econ classes was. But Mulligan was clearly antagonistic to the straight-jacket impact the Chicago school of thought was having on the field. This may, in part, be because Geography itself is, in short hand, the study of how things vary over space. As an academic field it is far more deductive than most others.

The solution is not a campaign to \"ban the box\" until later in the job application process, when it will still tank their chances.  The solution is to repeal all the unconstitutional victimless crimes on the books (because judges did not do their jobs of invalidating such lunacy) + to pardon (or give clemency to) every one of the approximately 70 million convicted of these victimless/consensual crimes.    The main cause of all these arrests, and of all crime in the world (especially violent crime) is the drug prohibition laws.  End those evil laws and most crime + violence in the world will end, overnight.<br/>Then, we can take the $ we save and provide people with free housing, food, minimal income, college, internet, etc. to give all Americans the chance to contribute to the world to the best of their abilities. <br/><br/>Pardoning the 70 million convicted of victimless crimes (+ making all immigrants legal) will also greatly increase the wages of ALL Americans, who will not have to compete against illegal workers earning slave wages.

Bush was president...  Basically Bush told Putin that Russia was a threat to which Putin replied that he thought that America was the greatest threat to peace on the planet.  Putin made some remarks along the lines of America, without restraint, meddling in world affairs and leaving disaster in it's wake.  He also alluded to modernizing the Russian military to combat this potential threat (U.S.A.).  As far as I can see, this is just what has happened.  To that end, I'm not at all surprised at what Russia is doing today.<br/><br/>As an American, I have to agree with Putin.  These actions taken by the U.S. government were beyond the needs of protecting the people of this nation.  They were acts of pure aggression.  It's time for America to rethink it's political aspirations and start working with the other nations instead of following it's present path.  The reality is that the world is much worse off than it was before the middle east became embroiled in conflict.  <br/><br/>I don't need to say it, but if Russia is pushed too far, the gloves come off.  I think it would be safe to say that the U.S.A. would act the same way if attacked by Russia.

They are Asian elephants (you can't train African elephants which is probably why they are going extinct).Asian elephants, like horses, oxen, camels, donkeys, all 'beasts of burden', have been bred &amp; trained for certain activities. In the wild Asian elephants do activities very similar to what humans ask them to do. There are cruel humans who mistreat all animals &amp; other humans. It doesn't mean that the animals should be sequestered.I knew a lady who was a good friend of themembers of Ringlings back in the 40's and 50's. She wrote a book about them. One of her friends was named Ruth. The girls who rode the elephants and did other sort of trained things in the circus were hired by the year. One year one of the girls and Ruth became good friends. When the music started for the opening parade (in which these 'show girls' rode in on the elephants) Ruth would leave her tent, go to 'her' girls and get her, at first it was only when the ground was muddy, then either muddy or it was wet, then every show. They did this all year, then the girl left, Ruth went to Sarasota for the winter. The next year everyone expected Ruth to go to that tent to get her friend, who had not rejoined the circus. She never did. Oh, Ruth was never led into the big top, she always took herself to the entrance, got in her place and waited for the announcement. Oh, Ruth was an elephant.

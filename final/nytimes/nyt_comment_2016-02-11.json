At least, in contrast to the Salafi groups, the Syrian Ba'ath Party, founded incidentally by a Syrian Christian, Michel Aflaq, from which the Assad regime sprang, provided space for Syrian religious minorities such as Christians and Alawites.  That is not to say that the Assad regime was any paragon of religious or political toleration.  But it seems to me the current alternative is even worse.  <br/><br/>So again, the question, why is Russian intervention in Syria any more reprehensible than that of the Americans, Saudis, Turks, Qataris, etc?

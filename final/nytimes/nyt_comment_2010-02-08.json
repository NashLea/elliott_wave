For one it occurred after the quarter ended.  For another even had it been in the run of play it wouldn't have counted... a point lost on many of Nate's critics.<br /><br />If D'Antoni wants to discipline Nate for his on-court celebrations then that's fine... that's the coach's prerogative.  Mind you, as I pointed out in an earlier discussion on the same point... I seem to recall Mark Jackson doing helicopters up and down the court as a rookie and everyone loved his \"youthful enthusiasm\".  But D'Antoni is not Pitino... so again, I won't complain about that.  What I found was ridiculous was benching him an entire month and saying dumb stuff like he doesn't know when Nate would next play again.<br /><br />As for the \"D'Antoni hating\" talk... I'll address that along with Chuck's assertion that the Knicks were \"winning\" without Nate.  Yeah they were winning so much that D'Antoni had to relent and reinsert Nate into the lineup... all he did was single-handedly win the Atlanta game for them.  It was pure happenstance that the \"winning\" coincided with the benching... as should be apparent to anyone with a basketball IQ. The real factor was that D'Antoni changed his tactics as mentioned above.  Once he decided to maximize possessions, rather than chuck it up every \"Seven Seconds or Less\" then the team responded.  D'Antoni admittedly wasn't given much to work with... but what he was given he woefully mismanaged.  Even in the midst of losing he (along with Walsh, no doubt) eschewed developing younger players in the vain hopes of winning.  Winning what??  How much have our two draft picks (Hill and Douglas) played?  Are either of them better than Ty Lawson or Brandon Jennings?<br /><br />This is the genius braintrust that you want to celebrate?

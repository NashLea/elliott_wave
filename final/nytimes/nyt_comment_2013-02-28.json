But two other things are needed to protect the vote. <br/><br/>First, we need to add the right to vote to our Constitution. The Constitution and Bill of Rights protect a lot of rights.

Voting, however, is key to our democracy surviving and thriving and, therefore, such right should be guarantee in our nation's cornerstone document. <br/><br/>Second, we need federal election standards for federal elections. Because federal elections are currently run by state and local officials, it is quite easy to restrict voting through steps like putting far fewer voting booths in urban areas, using confusing ballots, not providing for a paper trail, and applying different standards for counting votes and for dealing with disputed votes. Such shenanigans can be reduced through establishment of uniform federal standards that include expand early voting in all jurisdictions.

It is much cheaper and easier to make things sweeter, which is preferred for evolutionary reasons by a large majority of the population, than it is to find subtle seasoning and fllavoring changes that could have the same effect on overall demand.  HFCS made it cheaper to make things sweeter, therefore, processed food got sweeter and profits went up. Tastes change in response to the available food, and sweeter food became the new norm.

He went from \"There is a correlation between the amount of added sugar available in a nation's food supply and diabetes\" to \"sugar is toxic\", with no stops in between.  This kind of irresponsible reaction opens the door for science deniers to seed doubts about the truth.  He should have been more careful about his conclusions.<br/><br/>The data used in the study may not have been differentiated enough to determine the effects of different kinds of sugar supplements.  However, the research is out there, and has been for many years.

Sugar, as the authors briefly mention but then completely ignore, is a common term referring to all of the saccharides.  In effect, every carbohydrate (including wood) is a \"sugar.\"  If \"sugar\" causes diabetes, then shouldn't fruit, which is loaded with fructose, and beets, which are loaded with sucrose, cause diabetes?  No evidence exists linking apples to obesity or diabetes.  The study is too broad to be of any real use, as is the case with most surveys.  However, better studies and experiments exist which point the finger at the real culprit; high-fructose corn syrup.<br/><br/>A quick look at the available data shows a shocking correlation.  HFCS was introduced into most American soft-drinks in 1975-76.  The obesity epidemic began in 1976.  (USObesityRate1960-2004.gif)  No other factor so clearly correlates to the onset of the obesity epidemic.  Furthermore, recent experiments have demonstrated that HFCS isn't processed by your body in the the same way as sucrose (white or cane sugar).  In fact, while HFCS has all of the calories of sucrose, your insulin system doesn't recognize it as sugar.  You eat, but you don't feel full, leading you to eat even more while flooding your liver with sugar.<br/><br/>The FDA needs to put HFCS on the list of banned food additives, but it won't.

It conflates citizenship with racial identity; it blatantly advocates white supremacy; it is anti-Semitic; it appeals to fear and ethnically based hatred. By the way, Hitler was voted in as chancellor in a free election, and the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s--with as many as 40,000 members at its height--also put up many candidates under its banner, hoping to be brought into power through the parliamentary system.

It's a lesson he should have been learning from Patty, but apparently he thought himself above such things, and that fatal flaw was his undoing.  To my mind, what was done to Tom is a reflection of the whole point of this show:  it is, after all, called \"Damages.\"  And will Ellen learn from this awful incident?  I doubt it. She is, in a way, responsible for what happened to Tom:  she and Tom would have been wiser to follow Patty's instructions, but they thought they were capable of taking matters into their own hands.<br /><br />The lesson here is that pride, greed and ambition are not for amateurs. Playing hardball can hurt.  People do stupid and terrible things for money, and sometimes end up losing everything. This season proved that in spades.  Tom was a victim, Ellen was damaged but survived, and Patty remains, so far, undefeated.<br /><br />Although most of us here have agreed that the finale was too crammed with resolutions, at least there were credible and reasonably satisfying resolutions to the situations set up during the season.  All too many of today's TV dramas simply don't bother keeping things logical, and I appreciate the dramatic integrity of \"Damages.\"  I do hope we can continue to count on that.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1383578, "replies": [], "lft": 54, "assetURL": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/furloughs-arent-forever-career-advice-for-james-bond/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1879646, "rgt": 55, "userDisplayName": "ari", "createDate": "1271817348", "userID": 35039267, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1271822829", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Los Angeles", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1271819229", "commentSequence": 23, "commentBody": "How about a sense of humor as in SEAN CONNERY?

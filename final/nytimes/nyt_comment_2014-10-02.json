Since Lincoln's assassination,  Presidents Garfield, McKinley, Roosevelt major, Roosevelt minor, Kennedy, Ford, and Reagan were all shot at with no interference from the SS.  The cases of Ford and Reagan are particularly notable.  During a period of less than three weeks Gerald Ford was attacked, first by Squeaky Frome and then by Sara Jane Moore. Frome flred from point blank range but the weapon failed to go off because she had not properly loaded it.  Moore missed but not by much.  In 1981 Reagan was allowed to walk 30 feet from the rear entrance of the Washington Hilton to his limousine past a rope line of unvetted well-wishers, including John Hinckley.  Hinckley was able to fire six shots before being subdued by a civilian. To summarize, not a single determined attack has been prevented by the SS.<br/> Let us not, however, ignore the successes.

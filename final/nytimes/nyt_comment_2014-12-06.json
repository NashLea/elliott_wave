False reports of crimes generally are rare, but they do happen. It doesn't discredit rape victims to say that, once in a while, people make things up. Some people have neuroses or worse that drive them to seek attention through telling people their fantasies. It happens. Saying so does not equate to \"patriarchy\" or \"rape culture.\" It is merely common sense, based on the life we all live in the world. Liars exist. Why dispute that? We've all dealt with liars. There are no categories of behavior that liars won't lie about.

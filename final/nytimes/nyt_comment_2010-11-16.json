Below is an excerpt from <a href=\"http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/hard-lesson-for-hakeem-nicks-and-giants/?ref=sports\">Bill Pennington's article today</a> questioning that particular play.<br /><br />\"The Giants\u2019 best chance to retake the lead came midway through the second quarter, when they faced a third down at the Cowboys\u2019 2. But Manning inexplicably threw quickly to his left, firing the ball directly at defensive back Bryan McCann.\"<br /><br />Now to be fair... the \"inexplicably\" could be in reference to Gilbride's play call, questioning the pass play vs. a run play.  However, if that were the case then it certainly could have been better written.  More likely, it seems he's questioning Eli's decision to throw the ball to Nicks.  The play makes perfect sense and with Nicks' size advantage (essentially a post-up in basketball) we score on that play or get interference 90% of the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately the only thing that went wrong with that play was the execution by the receiver.  Aikman called it as soon as it happened, Eli's interaction with Nicks on the sidelines hinted at receiver error, Coughlin confirmed it... as did Eli, in the press conference later.  Why then was the play \"inexplicable\" to Bill Pennington??<br /><br />Good call, good throw... great defensive reaction to poor receiver play.  Nicks, for all his talents is still young and learning the position (not that I profess to be some expert).

Our ESL program was considered one of the two most effective programs in New York City. Along came a hotshot, abrasive, know-it-all Superintendent who decided that all District educational programs had to be micromanaged. He fired all the veteran, excellent Coordinators and replaced them with \"yes\" men and women who echoed his \"vision\". The result was that principals, teachers and students  were totally demoralized by the mechanical, business-like approach to education. Every student was expected to progress and frequent testing was implemented to ensure that \"goal\". Forget about individual differences. The District schools were run as they might have been in a fascist state.<br /><br />Fortunately, the Superintendent soon moved on to greener pastures. Bloomberg would have loved him!

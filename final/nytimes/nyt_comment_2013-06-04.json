On obvious criticism of this is that it mixes together things that should be distinguished: it is perfectly fair to judge stock-traders or policy experts on their ability to make money and prevent disaster.  But that is a far different matter than judging earlier philosophers, authors, visionaries, and so forth.  <br/><br/>Second, this reveals the most basic violation of proper historical method, because there isn't the slightest attempt to understand what experts in earlier time could and could not have known, or how remarkable it was that some people could form a powerful conception of what might come to pass, given the blindness about the future that envelopes every era. For example, one can easily laugh at Newton for believing that there was a universal ether, that the sun was the center of the universe, and so forth, if one ignores the obvious fact that he got a stupendous amount right, laying the basis for modern physics, and he created the most important revolution in scientific knowledge for several hundred years.

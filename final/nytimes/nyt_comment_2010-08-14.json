For multi-period investment, wherein amounts can be added or withdrawn along the way -- i.e., people's real-world serious investment -- there is NO SUCH THING as a \u201crisk-free rate.\u201d Even Sharpe, original champion of the risk-free rate, concedes this point. In his text, close to Bodie's in size, he devotes a whole large tiny-print page to it.<br /><br />With the mythical \u201crisk-free rate\u201d excluded on account of nonexistence, it makes no sense to talk about \u201clowest terminal wealth\u201d \u2013 unless you are referring to zero for every investment. What shape of the distribution\u2019s low-side tail are you and your sources envisioning?<br /><br />We are (at least I am) talking about viewing investments in terms of probabilities for dollar results relative to the investor\u2019s dollar needs and goals. For long investment terms, most of the probability distribution of a very aggressive investment will represent wealths many times those of most of the probability distribution of a very conservative investment. (Due to compounding of the aggressive's higher return-rate mean!) For such an investment, it is commonly true that for the investor\u2019s dollar needs and goals, the aggressive offers say 90% probability of meeting those dollar needs and goals, with most of its prospects much higher, while the conservative offers goal-meeting probability of (to the nearest whole percent) 0%. You and Bodie and whoever may consider the conservative less risky because of its lesser uncertainty, but I am on the investor\u2019s side and would consider the aggressive investment less risky.<br /><br />#26 Carl \u2013 Are you saying that in comparing investments in long-term RISK, we should consider differences in only uncertainties, and not differences in the means from which the uncertainties extend? I consider that to be on the side of the cartel of ivory tower investment professors, against the side of the investors. Probabilities for the investor\u2019s dollar results are determined by the combination of (a) mean and (b) uncertainties above and below it. And over longer terms, the advantage of higher return-rate mean increasingly outweighs the disadvantage of larger return-rate standard deviation.<br /><br />Dick Purcell<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1749752, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 2399074, "replies": [], "commentID": 2399086, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Ron Lieber", "createDate": "1281761927", "userID": 54480690, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1281761927", "userTitle": "Your Money columnist", "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Hugo Sondermeijer", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "depth": 1, "commentType": "reporterReply", "updateDate": "1281758327", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "To my mind, that's something different.

Now I am convinced he has better than an even chance to win or even trounce the next republican candidate for president. The reason I am convinced is look at the stupid and imbecile reactions by the other side to the GM story. In the previous article many of the so called patriotic Americans responded who no doubt are the first ones to raise the flag decried this limited success story many stating they would never buy an American car. Where do they rather these cars be made, in germany? how about japan? Many had a visceral hatred for the unions because the union bosses are so called in the pocket of the democratic party but guess what folks, these union people that have lost their livelihood and are fighting for survival are your fellow Americans many of whom and their relatives are the first to fight and die for our country. Look at how many union members volunteered during the 9-11 crisis often at peril to their long term health. It is not rocket science to be able to figure out that if Michigan or Ohio does well then it makes it more likely that California or Texas or Oklahoma will do better because people in Ohio or Michigan will be able to purchase more goods from California, Texas or Oklahoma. I am convinced the republicans will do well in the midterm election or may even pick up the house and/or the senate however I am more convinced that once Americans see what they have what these people are really made of Obama will be in a good position to stage one of the most remarkable comeback in history.

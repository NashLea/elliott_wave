One cannot for example, simply legislate male competitiveness out of existence. Nor can one legislate increased assertiveness in females. <br/><br/>Certainly one can try to implement mechanisms that Pareto maximizes the overall payoffs from such observable traits but it is unclear so far what this should look like. For example, it may not in fact look like a highly collaborative, equal and democratic environment. Everyone may actually be better off under some alternate scheme.<br/><br/>I do not know but I doubt that imposing egalitarianism for its own sake is likely to be the correct answer. There is after all, a distribution of talents, traits, competences, etc, and it is abundantly clear that this distribution is not the uniform one.

Financial institutions relied on these ratings and faulty risk management in their search for yield, and leveraged up to earn bigger returns. Freed from concerns of default, banks could farm out mortgage origination to mortgage brokers who are paid on commissions and have an incentive to sign up as many people as possible, regardless of whether they can actually afford the payments. These brokers are regulated at the state level and were not closely policed, leading to buses such as liar loans. The wide availability of mortgages coupled with too low interest rates courtesy of Greenspan fed a property bubble that snowballed. Traders at financial institutions piled into these mortgages because they are playing with other people's money and have an incentive to take a lot of risk.

It also presumes that the state becomes the ultimate owner of all capital and related decisions on how its spent when someone dies.<br/><br/>I suspect Mary does not imagine she would be taxed today and would object to an estate tax that applies to her.  She would be come even more strident if ALL of her assets were taken by they government when she dies.  But after all, what did potential recipients of her estate do to earn it?"}]}, "lft": 176, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/is-the-estate-tax-doomed/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8606358, "rgt": 187, "userDisplayName": "Mary Carmela", "createDate": "1364186066", "userID": 46188209, "replyCount": 5, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1364186105", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "PA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1364182505", "commentSequence": 19, "commentBody": "To argue that estate taxes are necessary or fair only in actual wars ignores the fact that our national budget continues to carry huge military expenses and increasing amounts of support for the ever growing population of seniors  -- both are enormous drains on the budget and must be paid for.   Both state and national governments face enormous costs for rebuilding our infrastructure and again, carig for seniors.<br/><br/>Those who complain that estate taxes hit assets that have already been subject to income taxes as that wealth was earned, ignore the fact that our income is taxed over and over and over again during our lifetimes  -- gasoline tax, sales tax, real estate tax, state, local and federal income taxes, liquor taxes, highway and bridge tolls, postage stamps, car registration fees, courthouse filig fees, use taxes, extra state tax on my evening gowns (go figure that one out), and who knows what else we are not even aware of.  So estate taxes are not the only taxes paid on what was once one's income.<br/><br/>Why should the next generation inherit?  They did nothing to earn that wealth other than be born, and during their growing years had lots of advantages in food, education, medical care, etc.  that so many other Americans can't even imagine.  Why can't each generation earn their own wealth, to enjoy during their lifetimes, and then pay it back to society in the form of significant estate taxes?", "recommendationCount": 49}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Greene, a professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell, sent this reaction to Kevin Trenberth's view of the human influence on Sandy (and my interpretation): <br /><br />I am not so sure that I agree with your take nor Kevin Trenberth's on Sandy .<br /><br />\"Indeed, in the case of Hurricane Sandy, any role for greenhouse gases was a background influence, even according to Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who\u2019s been one of the most vocal scientists using extreme weather to make a case for emissions action. But of course, the extent of destruction from the storm surge came because a tiny bit of extra sea height can hugely amplify a storm\u2019s impact.\"<br /><br />Greenhouse gases may have been \"a background influence\" for Hurricane Sandy; however, were they a background influence for hybrid superstorm Sandy? <br /><br />Sandy was only a modest late-season hurricane as it started its northward track from the Caribbean. Yes, the Atlantic Ocean temperatures were markedly warmer than the long-term average, but Sandy still weakened to tropical-storm strength by the time it moved north of Cape Hatteras, NC. That is when \"a series of unfortunate events happened.\" <br /><br />First, an unusually strong high-pressure blocking pattern over Greenland and the North Atlantic closed the door for Sandy to head northeast out to sea like most October hurricanes/tropical storms heading along such a trajectory. In fact, Sandy did not just track north over New England like the few other October hurricanes/tropical storms that did not head out to sea (think the 1991 Perfect Storm) ; rather, she did something never observed before (records going back to 1851) -  she turned due west towards the most populated area in North America.<br /><br />Second, while on this historically unprecedented westward trajectory, Sandy converged with an early \"winter\" nor'easter associated with an invasion of cold Arctic air into the middle latitudes. This transformed Sandy from a weakening October hurricane/tropical storm into an extra-tropical hybrid superstorm, one with the lowest atmospheric pressures ever recorded north of Cape Hatteras, NC and the second-largest extent (1000 km) of any extra-tropical storm derived from a hurricane  (only behind 2001's Hurricane Olga).<br /><br />Third, the historically unprecedented westward trajectory of Sandy led to the storm surge hitting the coasts of New York and New Jersey at an angle of incidence contributing to record high storm surges that exceeded the worst-case scenarios of models for parts of New York City.<br /><br />Now, one might argue that these were just a series of unfortunate events resulting from the coincidence of many rare and/or unprecedented acts of nature. However, there is increasing evidence that the loss of summertime Arctic sea ice due to greenhouse warming stacks the deck in favor of 1) more frequent invasions of Arctic air masses into the middle latitudes, 2) more frequent nor'easters associated with such invasions, and 3) more frequent blocking events of the kind that steered Sandy to the west. If one accepts this evidence and line of reasoning, and also takes into account the record loss of Arctic sea ice this past September, then perhaps the likelihood of greenhouse warming playing a significant role in Sandy's evolution as an extra-tropical superstorm is at least as plausible as the idea that she was simply a freak of nature.<br /><br />And, the arrival of a second nor'easter a few days later, which set some snowfall records in certain areas while making residents along the eastern seaboard even more miserable, just makes the largely an act of nature argument not very convincing to me.<br /><br />http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/faculty/Greene.html", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3347377, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7625934, "replies": [], "commentID": 7626258, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Kay Johnson", "createDate": "1352615148", "userID": 40249616, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1352652921", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 3, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Evelyn Elwell Uyemura", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Colorado", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1352652921", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Even the older folks usd ad time to make popcorn or throw laundry in the dryer.

It is Obama's sort of campaign -- one centered on person-to-person contact, one that sees the high-priced headquarters staff as tools of the grassroots organizers rather than their bosses, and one that understands that for a progressive to be elected, running a \"conventional\", ad-based campaign simply won't work -- that we needed in 2008, in 2012, and will need again in the future.<br/><br/>Obama owes his re-election in no small part to the incredible machinery of local organizers and volunteers that he's built over the past 5 years (and which is itching to be deployed in 2014 to avoid another midterm fiasco).

I was diagnosed with Stage IIIc ovarian cancer last year and the Cleveland Clinic recommended an implanted port before starting chemotherapy. Some of the chemotherapy drugs can be very caustic on small veins. They explained all of the benefits and risks and I immediately agreed. <br/><br/>After my initial debulking surgery, I was hospitalized 4 times in one year with additional complications and follow up surgery. Each time the hospital accessed the port once and left in a pigtail covered by special tape for the whole stay. The port works both ways - for blood draw and injecting fluids, chemotherapy and medications. They even used the port to inject radioactive glucose for my PET scan. The only time I've been stuck by a needle in my arm since my ovarian cancer diagnosis has been for surgical anesthesia. My platelet count went very low during chemotherapy treatment but, with a port, I never had to worry about insufficient blood clotting after port access.<br/><br/>Infection is a constant worry for immunologically suppressed.

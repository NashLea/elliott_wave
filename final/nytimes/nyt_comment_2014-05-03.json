If Taras Schevncko was an anti-Semite why was he considered a national hero in the Soviet Union?  Equating the trident to the Nazi swastika is offensive; it has no historical fact and the trident has been in existence since Vladimir the Great (988AD). Any commemoration of the Bandera movement was for its efforts to battle against the USSR (a nation which starved 7 million Ukrainians) during WWII; those who worked for the Nazis were a small number as many nations under Nazi occupation had the collaborators.  You also mentioned the head of the Jewish congress condemned the commemoration!  Conversely the head of Rabbi of Ukraine noted his greatest fear in Ukraine is not the rise of anti-Semitism but a Putin land invasion.   The efforts to anchor Ukraine to its past denies Ukraine to grow and seek acceptance in the world community as an Independent nation.

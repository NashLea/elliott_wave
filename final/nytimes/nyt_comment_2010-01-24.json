However, I have discovered some interesting features about the Nexus One Cellular phone that I would like to investigate further:<br /><br />3.7 inch high Amoled display micro SD card slot with 16.7 million colors and 800x480 pixel resolution<br />Linux 2.1 operating system with a wider variety of applications programming capabilities in JAVA<br />Very fast with 1 GHZ mobile processor with 600 MHZ CPU and DROID clocks in at 530 MHZ<br />512 MB of RAM<br />512 MB of ROM<br />Good voice input<br />Battery shelf life of 7.8 hour battery life<br />With the exception of AT&amp;T, Nexus One supports 3G globally<br />Supports HSDA for high speed performance on both uploading and downloading<br />Sim card capability to use on most GSM mobile devices.<br />Chrome web browser capabilities for rendering HTML-pages and JavaScript<br />Faster and Flexible web browsing capabilities wider range of searching<br /><br />The phone features seem to be impressive, however, there are problems for Google with public security. This is largely due to the iPhone Safari\u2019s internet browser feature, which has a dial phone number that is easily accessible by hackers. Hackers have the capability of taking over all calls incoming in and going out. They can obtain the phone numbers and use the numbers in dangerous ways. Google also has a problem with its wide range web browsing service. This service requires monitoring security levels and auditability to meet compliance requirements.<br /><br />To suggest a strategy for Google I would recommend referencing the server side of applications. For example, Cloud computing uses the Android operating system, with a high-speed network connection to communicate with a clone of itself and resides in the cloud-computing environment. Android is used to maximize what the server architect and programmers can do on a small client machine. It preserves battery power because in the server environment, Android is hooked into a power grid, which allows for a lot of software access from the grid.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1086536, "replies": [], "lft": 58, "assetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/a-big-picture-look-at-google-microsoft-apple-and-yahoo/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1465013, "rgt": 59, "userDisplayName": "John Dingler", "createDate": "1264310117", "userID": 59783768, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264310326", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Berkeley", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264310326", "commentSequence": 25, "commentBody": "I guess more dots does not necessarily mean better.

While clicking through the images in the slideshow I began to ask myself, \"Is this too much? Would the individuals depicted want me to see them in these circumstances? Has anyone asked permission to take these photos?\"<br /><br />Then, just at that moment, my seven-year-old daughter walked up beside me and began staring at the computer screen. I had already attempted to explain to her about the earthquake, as well as about the prior conditions in Haiti, but, as we do not have television, she had not yet seen any images of the disaster. So, at that point, I sat down with her, and we spent the next hour looking at the photos and talking about them. It was this experience, I think, which enabled her to process and completely comprehend all that I had been telling her.<br /><br />In this sense, I feel that these photographs, and particularly the larger photo essay, are an invaluable tool of understanding, and not at all sensationalist. If the real horrors had not been shown, if the more gruesome or heart-wrenching photos had been edited out, the truth would not have been accurately depicted. Yes, no doubt, visual images - especially such graphic images as these - are far more evocative of intense emotions than are mere words. But I think that, particularly in a situation such as this, we have to ask ourselves if it is really just that we should ask to be \"spared\" the gruesome and horrific details. Perhaps there is also a just concern that in depicting the suffering and death of these individuals the Times is somehow robbing them of their basic human dignity. But my question is this: Which is more dignified - to suffer and die and to have one's suffering and death go undocumented and therefore unacknowledged by the masses, or to suffer and die and it be documented so that it might serve to bring awareness to the masses? There is no human dignity in suffering and death that goes unnoticed.", "recommendationCount": 6}, {"assetID": 1062213, "replies": [], "lft": 46, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/opinion/17pubed.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1464184, "rgt": 47, "userDisplayName": "Hassan", "createDate": "1264290280", "userID": 57282263, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1264314640", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Atlanta", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1264314640", "commentSequence": 16, "commentBody": "<br />It is easy to point fingers at the Times and their reporters and editors when a few mistakes or omissions are made.

The review explains that the book confused Jim Johnson's use of 'affordable lending goals as a cover for warding off stronger regulation'  as he 'in particular linked his own compensation to Fannie\u2019s earnings' in the nineties with 'the surge of risky private lending and securitization that nearly brought down the financial system [in] the 2000s.'   The review details the Government Sponsored Entities' lesser ownership of the risky mortgages and notes that their default rates on these instruments were a third of those suffered by the private banks in the wake of the '08 crisis..<br/><br/>The real truth is that the GSEs were done in when they were privatized in 1968 - as Robert Kuttner put it (Huffpost 9/8/08), 'under private management, Fannie did a 180. It was perverted from a government-sponsored and well managed agency that served the public interest into a privatized casino whose big bets enriched a few insiders and then helped crash the entire system.'<br/><br/>The problem is never government but its perversion by that which perverts, like Midas, all it touches, which is to say, the profit motive.<br/><br/>The Detective In The Mirror<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.TheMirrorBlog.com\" title=\"www.TheMirrorBlog.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.TheMirrorBlog.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 60}, {"assetID": 3297245, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 5128071, "replies": [], "commentID": 5128273, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "John Sweeney", "createDate": "1324710088", "userID": 1800174, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1324740356", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 1, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "masayaNYC", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seattle", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1324740356", "commentSequence": 71, "commentBody": "Actually, once the mortgage boom got going, most of the crummy loans were from mortgage brokers -- think Countrywide.

So while the Republican meme is that the government intervention in housing generally benefits lazy poor people, the reality is that most government assistance allows the wealthy to afford McMansions.<br/><br/>We should convert the mortgage interest deduction to a housing credit, with each head of household getting a credit on their taxes of a few thousand a year instead of rich homeowners with big mortgages getting to reduce their tax bills by tens of thousands, while the poor (and the renters) get nothing.

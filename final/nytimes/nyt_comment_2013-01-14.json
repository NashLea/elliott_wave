Though you teach, and I'm sure your intentions are good, this attitude contributes to a hobbling of our cerebral resources and human capital in the United States.<br/><br/>I'd be willing to wager that, while basic education is important to some extent, some very large segment of the population does not need the knowledge learned in secondary education. While it sounds blunt, the students that will have relatively large marginal impacts on the productivity in the United States (or globally) will generally be those classified as \"gifted.\" In my mind, there is no reason to promote the education of those on the lower end of the spectrum at the expense of the most talented; while focusing on the slower students might satisfy some primal sense of fairness, it is not nearly as helpful to society to focus resources on students with a likely low level of return on educational resources.<br/><br/>Imagine this situation: you can choose in 4th grade to focus resources on someone who will ultimately be a secretary or one who will be some sort of scientist (a broad category admittedly)--which do you choose? The additional resources will likely not make the first much better (if at all) at being a secretary, but could easily make a large impact on the success of the second, and consequently the \"value\" returned to society.

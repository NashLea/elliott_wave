Mr. Moskowitz's heartfelt description of unconscious bias in the parenting sphere is important to be aware of for anyone working with families. We shouldn't presume that parenting responsibilities rest primarily with moms, or that dads are less capable or competent caregivers. As a pediatrician myself, I know it takes effort - unconscious bias is powerful, and moms are the parents of record in most of our training and thinking. <br/><br/>But here's the important thing Mr. Moskowitz and dads like him, and like me, need to realize. The audience we should be most concerned about being visible to is our kids. How our parenting is seen in our kids' eyes trumps whatever their teachers, pediatricians, and babysitters see when they look at us. Mr. Moskowitz's son is already old enough to realize the kind of dad he has, and to feel the blessings of having two loving and committed parents. No  bias from our kids.

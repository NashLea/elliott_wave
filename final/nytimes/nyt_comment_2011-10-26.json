To illustrate this, I will cite two cases. one person survived the other didn't. The first person was my mother who was a nurse and believed that bi-annual mamograms were a waste of time. The second person is a friend of mine. You may have noted I used the past tense when referring to my mother and the present tense when referring to my friend. One morning my mother was putting on deodorant and found a lump under her armpit. Her doctor sent her for a mamogram and CAT scan. The results were that they found it was too late as the cancer was metastatic and had spread via the lymphatic system throughout her body. Her oncologist said, 'if only you had come to me six months earlier we may have been able to do something'. She died dreadfully six months later.The second lady had her bi-annual mamogran and they found a cancer the size of a grain of rice. She had radiation and chemotherapy treatment and now two years later she is fine. In Australia it is recommended that we have a breast screen (mamogram) every two years from age fifty. Remembering how my mother died, I do this religiously. Our system here is set up so that every two years we receive a reminder  to let us know that our screening is due. It is only unimportant to those who have never had breast cancer. However, no-one is immune. I have also been told that you are not likely to get breast cancer if you have had children and breast fed, but this is not true either, as a friend of mine had 14 children and believed this protected her so that she didn't have to bother with mamograms. It didn't protect her and she never even survived to the end of the treatment. I leave all of you ladies out there to judge for yourselves whether it is worthwhile or not to have a mamogram.

Without a doubt, for most people who succeed, exercise is really more important than diet.

I have recently lost 55 pounds and believe I will keep it off, but could not without regular exercise. There is a subset of people, mostly women, for whom exercise helps little, or maybe not at all. But for most people, while mathematically calorie intake reduction may seem the bigger factor, it is much harder to keep weight off without exercise. In effect, a routine that includes regular exercise helps me control my appetite as it applies to a well-designed weight management program. You have to learn to train your own brain to make this work. It helps you subvert the \"starvation reaction\" that dooms most diets. It is really breaking an addiction cycle that is the result of people naturally making food a \"reward.\" You have to tame the reward center in your brain, and exercise is a big key to this. I have also walked enough in the last 9 months to burn off about 150,000 calories -- 5.5 miles per day on average. How can that not help?

Yeah there's a whole host of issues here, first and foremost that we probably shouldn't be eating highly processed foods with dubious nutritional value in the first place but that's kind of beside the point. The labeling isn't going to influence consumer behavior. Understanding that, I think it's better that the labels reflect the portion sizes people are actually eating, because right now it's just too easy to ignore the suggested serving size and think you are getting a lot less fat/calories/sodium/fill in the blank than you are because in many cases the serving sizes are ridiculous. Not so much for discrete foods like Oreos, but more for stuff like soup or muffins, where it's not really easy to eat 1/3 of it or 1/2 of it, unless you start getting out a weighing scale or a measuring cup. And why should you have to be programmed to double or triple every measure because of the absurd serving sizes? That reminds me of people who set their clocks 5 minutes ahead and then mentally add 5 everytime they look at them. The bottom line is food manufacturers are trying to bend the rules by making unhealthy food look less bad for you then it is. This has nothing to do with government parternalism or coddling of adults like a lot of people on here are asserting. It simply has to do with honesty in labeling and preventing conglomerates from playing games which I think is squarely within the responsibility of government.", "recommendationCount": 7}, {"assetID": 3287509, "replies": [], "lft": 304, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/us/politics/poll-finds-anxiety-on-the-economy-fuels-volatility-in-the-2012-race.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4760915, "rgt": 305, "userDisplayName": "Jerry   Schrader", "createDate": "1319602342", "userID": 30026248, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1319602865", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Salem,OR", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1319599265", "commentSequence": 143, "commentBody": "When congressional leadership and chairmanships are bought with donations to the respective Congressional election Committees and paid for on an installment plan no sensible person would have confidence in the work of the congress.

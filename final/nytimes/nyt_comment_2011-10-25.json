With the passage of a comprehensive anti-slaughter bill the easy button would be removed and breeders would have no other choice but to breed quality over quantity. Lower supply, higher prices, fewer neglect issues....Not hard to comprehend.  The same segment of the horse industry that insists they are livestock IE: We should be able to slaughter them for food if we want to, depends on the larger share of the market (horse owners that view them as companions) to buy what they produce. It is no more complicated than too many middle to lower end horses flooding the market. Supply and demand works the same in this industry as it does in any other. If we (the majority of horse owners) did not view them as pets, spending millions of dollars yearly on all the products out there for them, there would be very little demand for horses. Most people do not use them for work. They own them because they WANT to. Breeders can't have their cake and eat it too. Livestock animals vs companion animals? A lot of business men/women would cringe at the thought of us viewing them as livestock. No more expensive tack, toys, clothing, shampoos etc etc. I don't see all those products available for cows, sheep, pigs and chickens, but then they are livestock that are bred, born, raised and slaughtered just for our food.

Separating a child from their mother is a trauma.  Lifton talked about \"premature ego development\" which really relates more to Mahler's observations about separation/individuation than narratives.  Narrative was more important to Lifton in the time that she grew up where it was taboo to want to know where you came from.  But the trauma is not the gap in narrative, it's the impact of separation.  Infants go through a phase where they spend many months coming out of symbiosis with their mother and gradually begin to have a separate sense of self.  When a child is separated from their mother, that happens in one traumatic impact.  How well they recover from it depends on circumstances and the capacity for both adoptive parents and child to bond to each other.  That process is automatically handicapped from the lack of biological matching, mother's hormones, et al.  But it leaves an imprint regardless of all of that.  <br/><br/>Some of the things you mention that happen to non-adoptees are also traumas.  IMO, better to recognize the traumas that befall us all rather than sweep under the rug the fundamental fact that the circumstances that cause adoption are traumatic to the child, and usually to the birthmother as well.   <br/><br/>I long for a world where adoption and all other reproductive support and alternative methods for having a child are all made non-profit and completely transparent.  Where every person can at least know as an adult where s/he came from.  If the profit motive was removed from all of this, we'd have far fewer ethical/philosophical questions to grapple with.

In the last decade, this work has frequently involved working with orphans, some of whom have lived/live with extended families, others who have found their way into some kind of orphanage (usually sponsored by one or another US Church, which can present other \u201ccultural\u201d problems).  Also during this time, adoptions by US couples became a major scandal, resulting in the passage and implementation of draconian new Guatemalan laws concerning adoptions.   <br/><br/>Early in the 2000\u2019s, I shared several flights back to the US with 12 to 20 beaming US couples clutching just-past newborn (and too often screaming in unison) Guatemalan babies.  At one level it was touching to see so many enthralled parents.  At another level, there was something about this mass migration of innocents that I found unsettling, some hint of \u201ccultural imperialism\u201d that somehow offended me.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no question that new laws were needed in order to deal with corrupt Guatemalan agencies.  I don't have any idea how well the laws have curbed unethical and illegal baby merchants in recent years.  I do know from personal experience, however, that some of these new laws have posed serious obstacles to the well-being of many children by denying them the opportunity to be adopted by US couples.   <br/><br/>Laws/enforcement changes fast in Guatemala, but as of last year orphans were routinely denied permanent residence in good homes, placed in the homes of relatives who don\u2019t want or couldn\u2019t care for them, or institutionalized in unwholesome circumstances because adoption to US couples became too difficult.<br/><br/>I\u2019m still uncomfortable with wholesale adoption of developing world babies by developed world couples.  What happened following enactment of Guatemala\u2019s laws, however, pointed out clearly to me that many children who live in poor countries have a lot more to lose from \u201cenabling violations\u201d than by tight restrictions on adoption.", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 3287139, "replies": [], "lft": 238, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/the-dilemmas-of-international-adoption/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4753517, "rgt": 239, "userDisplayName": "xSamplex", "createDate": "1319505808", "userID": 2358483, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1319515889", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boston, MA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1319512289", "commentSequence": 106, "commentBody": "I, like some other posters here have stated, am troubled by the focus of so many middle/upper middle class families (especially white) on foreign adoptions.

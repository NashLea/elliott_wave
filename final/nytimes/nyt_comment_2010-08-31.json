Mr. Gutting's reliance on 'cutting-edge philosphical discussions' to argue for the existence of God is, frankly, ridiculous. Using philosophy to draw conclusions is, at its best outdated, and at its worst very dangerous. I say dangerous because philosophy, under the rouse of objective conclusions, can be used to control the masses of societies (look at Catholicism as an example). Mr. Gutting's arguments, seeped in the ways others view how God ought to be, paint him as a man lacking independent thought and critical thinking. He finds philosophical arguments that support his preconceived view of the world, and use these as evidence that God exists. In contrast, throughout \"The God Delusion\" Professor Dawkins invokes several lines of independent evidence to show that the existence of a supernatural being is extremely unlikely. Dawkins demonstrates that science has shown that natural geological and biological processes can explain things that, with the lack of scientific observations, were historically attributed to a supernatural power. Likewise, Dawkins carefully uses the lack of any empirical evidence to bolster his argument, while understanding that the lack of evidence for something is not evidence that something does not exist (although after 6,000 years of no evidence you would think that God would make his presence known).<br /><br />The point is that religious folks constantly seem to have the need to argue for the existence of their particular diety. It would relieve a lot of their heartburn to just admit to themselves that it is impossible to prove the existence of their God. Philosophical arguments aside, no matter how hard one tries, there is no observational evidence demonstrating God. That's what faith is: believing in something despite the lack of evidence, or in modern society, despite the overwhelming evidence for alternative explanations. Maybe religion is like an addiction. You know that everytime you invoke the 'power of God' through prayer, or what have you, that likely nothing will happen. But because you haven't admitted to yourself that you're belief is completely irrational you continue to do it. Perhaps, once you face the facts and realize that everything we know denies the existence of God then you can get over the addiction and move on to a much more fullfilling and rewarding life.<br /><br />Gutting's most salient attempt at a real argument is his reference to the infamous 'orbiting teapot'. But even here he demonstrates an inability towards meaningful debate, and in my view borders on intellectualy dishonesty: 'But suppose that several astronauts reported seeing something that looked very much like a teapot and, later, a number of reputable space scientists interpreted certain satellite data as showing the presence of a teapot-shaped object, even though other space scientists questioned this interpretation'. Gutting goes on to equate the empirical and independently repeatable observation of an orbiting teapot to an individual's anecdote about feeling God, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of science. In the case of the teapot enough observations could be made to determine fairly certainly whether a teapot shaped object was orbiting the sun; in the case of an individual claiming to feel God it is impossible to repeat or quantitatively demonstrate and is therefore excluded from scientific interpretation.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1744762, "replies": [], "lft": 1866, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2467137, "rgt": 1867, "userDisplayName": "Charlotte", "createDate": "1283168790", "userID": 23019448, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1283227841", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Florence, MA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1283224241", "commentSequence": 865, "commentBody": "I think you are awesomely right Gary, but these days, Dawkins' oversimplifying of the issues sells.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1792635, "replies": [], "lft": 510, "assetURL": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/a-republican-comes-out-of-the-closet/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2467298, "rgt": 511, "userDisplayName": "Tim", "createDate": "1283170666", "userID": 59405129, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1283227841", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1283224241", "commentSequence": 201, "commentBody": "Quoting Ralph, #7:<br />\"Sincere, honest, loving, genuine people oppose two men or two women attacking the sanctity of those in heterosexual marriages.

Or perhaps more charitably their actions and/or beliefs were.

I don't know where you got your 85% figure, but whatever it was then, I bet it is a lot lower now.

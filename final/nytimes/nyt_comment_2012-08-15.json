Going to both men and women's games, the major difference I noticed was how organised the crowds were at Red Bull. Sometimes the ardor of the Red Bulls fans was so disproportional to the quality displayed on the field that it was frankly just awkward. In some games, people didn't really care what was going on in the field, it was about how much noise they could make. Perhaps for men, cheering for a team is a socially acceptable bonding tool, while for women, it's shopping. <br/><br/>If there is a way to make watching women's soccer a socially approved bonding tool for women, that's the new league right there.

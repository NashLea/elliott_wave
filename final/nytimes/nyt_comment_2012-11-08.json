Romney still hadn't gotten closer than 60-40 odds.  It wasn't that I felt that Nate was a partisan hack -- far from it, for as in 2008, I was always reassured that he was just reporting what the statistics and what the polling showed, whether good or bad for either side.<br/><br/>So thank you, Nate -- you were a refreshing oasis of sanity amid all the efforts to spin the latest news cycle into \"momentum\" or \"toss-up\" status.  As much as I was pleased by the results last night, though -- I was even more delighted to see your calm, careful work vindicated as each state turned the same color as they had been on your pre-election maps.", "recommendationCount": 3}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

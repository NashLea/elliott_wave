The question asked was simple and the answer was direct. The question was whether Modi regretted anything about the massacre of thousands of people that happened under his watch in 2002? Modi replied he regretted the fact that he didn't manage the media better. It is a chilling answer. Of course, if you don't want to go by that, you can go by the numerous hate speeches that Modi made against Muslims after 2002. Today Modi might want to distance himself from Hindu extremist leaders, but what he has been saying about Muslims in the past has been no different than the Hindu extremist leaders. (Hum paanch, hamara pachhis, anyone?). Any decent human being (whatever his or her political views) should be worried that extremist Hindu organizations in India like VHP/Bajrang Dal and RSS has millions of adherents. I have seen Hindu extremists calmly defending the murder of thousands including innocent women and children. It is high time the world takes note of this fascist movement in the worlds largest democracy.

False accusations of sex crimes are quite common, being used among other things as a \"nuclear bomb\" option in divorce cases to automatically win custody of the children, no questions asked, yet prosecutions are exceedingly rare. The deck is already severely stacked in favor of accusers and against the accused by the improper assumption that all accusers are \"victims\" that causes their identity to be protected, while the name of the accused, who may or may not be guilty, is dragged through the mud. Hopefully this \"Victims\" protection act you laud is designed to protect all victims involved when there is an accusation of sexual misconduct, whether the victim is the accuser or the accusee. I suspect however that the act is presuming that the accuser in any given case is identical to the \"Victim\" which is a highly improper assumption for a nation supposedly based on principles of legal fairness dating back to the magna carta, including the right to an impartial and fair trial, and the right to not be presumed guilty without having been convicted based on evidence.

Charging the officer, employees, shareholders, directors -- that makes sense.  <br/><br/>Corporations are legal persons -- but not legal people.  They are merely a way that people group together to act together.  A group, as such, is a concept -- not someone who can be imprisoned.  Charge the individuals, not the concept of an organization.<br/><br/>The same entity confusion plagues people who argue that corporations should not have  right to free speech.   Of course they should not -- because it's not the corporation that has a right to free speech -- it is the people who are the shareholders, directors, officers, and shareholders.  <br/><br/>People have free speech rights and people can commit crimes.  They are the ones who deserve freedom and who deserve to be punished when they violate the law.  ", "recommendationCount": 31}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

I think that the best chance for the West to prevent (or at least minimize) these attacks is through intense intelligence work rather than re-intensifying the cycle of deployments that has had such a negative impact on service members and their families.  Not to mention what further unintended consequences might flow from renewing an American/NATO ground war in Iraq and pushing it into Syria.

The California lab under the direction of Governor Brown has validated your theories for US economic recovery.  <br/><br/>The American people have invested a great deal in developing the natural &amp; human resources of this State.  Think of the water projects that turned this natural desert into one of the Nation's biggest producers of food.  Sure they are having water problems &amp; the San Andreas fault makes engineering more challenging but CA certainly seems to attract a lot of very creative talent.  Californians have made a remarkable contribution to this country &amp; the national investments made have paid a handsome return.<br/><br/>America's taxpayers have agreed that California needs a North-South High Speed Rail system.  And Governor Brown has made this his legacy project.  California needs high speed rail but to a magnetic levitated (Maglev) person like me, it seems to be a huge mistake.  Steel wheels pounding on steel rails is a maintenance challenge.  There are only a couple of routes in the world that operate without a subsidy.  California's HSR route will be very expensive to construct &amp; construction will also require subsidization.  <br/><br/>I have not talked to Gov. Brown but, if I could, I am convinced that he could be persuaded that a 300 mph superconducting Maglev system for carrying passengers &amp; freight trucks in Maglev vehicles would be a better deal. <a href=\"http://www.magneticglide.com\" title=\"www.magneticglide.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.magneticglide.com</a>  It is faster, much cheaper to build &amp; operate than steel wheels.", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 3407219, "replies": [], "lft": 31, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/journeyer-through-grouchland/", "parentID": 12384346, "commentID": 12384557, "rgt": 32, "userDisplayName": "Viv", "createDate": "1406260762", "userID": 22837994, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1406260808", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Jerusalem, Israel", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1406257208", "commentSequence": 12384557, "commentBody": "VV in Boston, you took the words out of my mouth about disinterest.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3407189, "replies": [], "lft": 51, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/world/americas/administration-weighs-plan-to-move-processing-of-youths-seeking-entry-to-honduras-.html", "parentID": 12380811, "commentID": 12383638, "rgt": 52, "userDisplayName": "Concerned Citizen", "createDate": "1406251312", "userID": 11228992, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1406260833", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Anywheresville", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1406257233", "commentSequence": 12383638, "commentBody": "The immigrant groups you mention (from past centuries) came here LEGALLY.

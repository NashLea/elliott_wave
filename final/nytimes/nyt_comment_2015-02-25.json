If they refused to pay, the providers would slow down traffic.  The customers would become frustrated and look to buy elsewhere, thereby reducing revenues to the above mentioned.  The cable companies have decided that they don't just want to charge their customers for usage; they want a cut of the action that big, successful merchandisers enjoy.  \"Why shouldn't AT&amp;T get part of Amazon's profits if AT&amp;T is the provider that allows that customer to access Amazon,\" is the way the thinking goes.  Also, for the millionaires and billionaires, they'd start enjoying superior quality and speeds for a little more money, and they'd get preferential treatment.  <br/><br/>Well now the FCC can regulate the amount of money cable companies charge for internet access, just like they were able to regulate the cost of long-distance calling during the days of Ma Belle.  And when the cable companies want to raise rates, they'll have to ask permission of the FCC and give a damned good reason for wanting to raise those rates.  I see no down side here.  They've enjoyed carte blanche up till now; it's time someone reigned them in.  And the FCC should have the authority to do that.  The FCC should be a stalwart against companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon and Time-Warner straining and draining the consumer's pocket book just because their greed knows no bounds.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 3422604, "replies": [], "lft": 995, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/technology/path-clears-for-net-neutrality-ahead-of-fcc-vote.html", "parentID": 14233590, "commentID": 14233774, "rgt": 996, "userDisplayName": "Eric Jain", "createDate": "1424838919", "userID": 69685764, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1424841098", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Seattle, WA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1424841098", "commentSequence": 14233774, "commentBody": "Net Neutrality doesn't mean that a company or consumer can't buy more bandwidth, but that it's none of the ISPs business how you decide to use the bandwidth you paid for.

It is at the heart of who has power in the US and elsewhere.  Here, the rich pay virtually no tax on inheritance because taxes on property are zero.  They pay about 25% less tax rate on income because of things like low rates for capital gains.<br/><br/>Liberals, Progressives and indeed all Americans must fight against the power of the wealthy, especially those who have inherited it rather than earned it.  Thomas Jefferson felt so strongly about it that he outlawed extreme inheritances when he was governor of Virginia.<br/><br/>Today, we must tax both capital gains and inheritances as if they were ordinary income.  We should not continue to allow the undeserving rich to pay about half the tax rate that middle class earners pay on equivalent wages and salaries.<br/><br/>The death spiral has started and it must be stopped.  Low taxes on wealth lead to the rich being more rich, which enables them to purchase the votes of more legislators, who then lower their taxes further.  <br/><br/>This simple point should be the focus of liberal politics.  People who do not make this point should no longer be supported by liberals.  For instance, Obama's cowardly extension of the Bush tax cuts should lead to less support for him, even though he is a better choice than the Republican alternative.

Although even my young self realized that she was flawed, she persevered, and indeed, thrived, when her society fell apart while most everyone else tried to cling to dead social customs.  The crisis generated by the Civil War and the Reconstruction freed her from the stultifying roles that women were expected to play in the Old South and allowed her to fully take advantage of her \"head for figures\" and to excel at running a business and to become prosperous.  Yet, she felt the sting of judgment from other women, and worried that her mother would not approve of her actions.  Melanie's character is the perfect foil to Scarlett's  -- they highlight each other's strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>The movie has made it impossible for me to imagine Scarlett other than as Vivian Leigh phenomenally portrayed her.  Equally mesmerizing, in a much quieter way, was Olivia DeHavilland's steady performance as Melanie.

In education, the vast majority of primary school teachers are still women. The reason for this, I would argue, is not a pay differential, especially in today's economy, where teachers' jobs are relatively secure and well compensated (though not nearly as much so as they should be.) Nor do men, by and large, stay away from the field because they think it is \"sissy.\" Rather, it is because they viscerally understand that to acquire a mate (wife, partner, girlfriend, whatever), they have to be desirable. To put it simply, I have never heard of a girl who fantasized growing up and marrying a kindergarten teacher. Yes, most women explicitly support the idea of men teaching in the early grades. However, that is an abstraction, and unless and until women demonstrate that they will take those guys home with them and stay with them, men will stay out of those positions. <br/><br/>Another deterrent to men's involvement as grade school teachers is the public perception of men, not women, as potential pedophiles, thus producing a more suspicious work environment for men.", "recommendationCount": 48}, {"assetID": 3388328, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 10600009, "replies": [], "commentID": 10600057, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "taiko", "createDate": "1385358653", "userID": 10331021, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1385382053", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 1, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "OzarkOrc", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Oakland, CA", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1385382053", "commentSequence": 10600057, "commentBody": "Don't forget Loretta Sanchez, who unseated \"B-1 Bob\" Dornan.

The last paragraph, however, might be off a bit. The idea of \"starve the beast\" became a behind the scenes credo of Republicans in part because they didn't get a full plate (or better yet, an empty plate) of what they wanted in the Reagan years. Reagan was radical on some matters, but he was, at heart, something of an ordinary American. He didn't want to tear down and destroy the nation, its govt., or the fundamental accomplishments of the previous 100 yrs. He was also willing to compromise. <br/><br/>Starve the beast was another way of saying, if taken to its logical conclusion, that it would be great to drive the federal enterprise into bankruptcy. That way, the Republican belief that govt. can't do anything right would be demonstrated to the world and everything, except defense spending, would have to be cut to the bone. The actual program, too much spending, two wars plus tax cuts, was put into place under G.W.Bush.<br/><br/>The ACA marks the end game for the Republican anti-government argument. They will, of course, continue to bellow out the same tune, but many fewer will be listening. The last great piece of what started with FDR during the Great Depression will be in place. The only way forward with the same ideology would be to engineer an actual, unstoppable bankruptcy of our nation, something even their business and wealthy clients, in the main, would oppose.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 26}, {"assetID": 3388319, "replies": [], "lft": 69, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/start-of-a-bumper-sticker/", "parentID": 10599250, "commentID": 10600021, "rgt": 70, "userDisplayName": "Mac Knight", "createDate": "1385357500", "userID": 65278019, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1385357526", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Yakima, WA", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1385357526", "commentSequence": 10600021, "commentBody": "In bed on a Kindle.

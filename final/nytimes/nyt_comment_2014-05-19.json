While  it may be personally satisfying to some who didn't lose their shirts in the Crash, a display of smug is no explanation of what actually happened. <br/><br/>Many borrowers may have behaved foolishly, even foolhardily--but by far the majority of those who lost their homes and meagre savings in the 2008 Crash were just ordinary folks behaving as Americans are expected to behave.  They earned less than they needed to live in the manner those acres of advertisements told them they should, so they borrowed the money.   Their household income had been falling, so they borrowed more.   They only did what their President, in the wake of 9/11 told them to do: keep spending.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, they did all that borrowing at the wrong time.   They did it during a bubble in the precise sector, housing, that also housed their equity, when the fundamentals of the economy were weak, when we were borrowing hundreds of billions to pay for the disaster of Iraq, when the banksters were unregulated and when those same banks' wealth was serially invested in worthless paper instruments that no one could rate or understand.<br/><br/>Was there immorality afoot?  Was virtue in decline?   Maybe so, but that decline did not occur solely or even to a great degree in the millions of foreclosed homes.  <br/><br/>Looking for vice?  Look at greed rampant.

The unions brought about decent working conditions at decent pay, not only for union members but for employees in general. Now, the unions have been reduced to a shadow of their former selves as states passed so-called \"right to work\" laws and many manufacturing jobs were sent overseas.

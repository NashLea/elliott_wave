As we all can see crime has no color or religion, it is simply a vile act committed against all humanity.

To my mind, the community was betrayed by the individual who committed the crime, and by the people who almost certainly knew that individual was disturbed. If he truly was hearing voices, it did not start on Monday. He did not fall mentally ill overnight. Although any community may blame the family and friends of a murderer for not getting help for a mentally ill loved one, the more tightly-knit the community, the more shocking and outrageous the betrayal will seem.  \r<br/><br/>I say this not to imply that families or friends of criminals *should* be blamed for the acts of their associates. Rather, I simply think that natural tendency is more understandable in a case like this. The very insular, self-policing type of group depends heavily on trusting each member to act for the good of all members in accordance with a certain code. A violation of that trust calls into question the validity of the isolation, which they take completely for granted. It's not about being racist or thinking they're superior, it's about thinking they knew something for sure and being shown that they were wrong. Being that wrong can be pretty hard to swallow for doctrinaire religious zealots.\r<br/><br/>Those of us who live in the real world understand that we cannot assume anything about members of a community based on a particular shared trait. These people don't live in the real world.

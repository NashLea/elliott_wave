I appreciate the feedback, lots to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>I'm honored to be praised by you intelligent, wise people.  As to the green checks, I expect not to get one because sometimes my comments are outrageous; I write all in a burst and hardly ever edit.  As to the oft-remarked on notion of the liberal/conservative divide, I've got thoughts on that too, naturally.<br/><br/>We're not really liberal nor conservative.  We're individuals, all with different outlooks and experiences.  More liberal people are drawn to the NYT, but plenty of conservatives, and the real thing that draws us is intelligence.  This is not a place of propaganda or dumbing-down, there's a lot of analysis going on, and we like it.<br/><br/>I myself am mainly liberal but have diverged quite a lot from the norm; as Miss Ley says I'd rather tigers ate people than people hunted tigers.  I'm pro-2nd amendment too (much to many's dismay), and anti-illegal immigrant, as actually a lot of us technical liberals are.  And I've seen 'liberals' here be fully against the Palestinians, or unregulated abortion, or legal marijuana, lots of standard liberal stuff.<br/><br/>So I'd advise don't rush to pigeonhole people, discuss things on the merits.

Spain has a floating point federalism - where there are various different regions that all have a different arrangement (thus 'floating point') with the central government.<br/><br/>A solution is to put all of Kurdistan, save the Iranian section, into Turkey on a floating point arrangement, and perhaps acknowledge other regions as well. Then make getting along a condition for continued access and association to the European Union and NATO security.<br/><br/>The Evolution of Cooperation (Robert Axelrod) teaches two things.<br/>Cooperation to exist requires a perpetual relationship AND opportunity (i.e. benefit from cooperation). You must have both. European style prosperity and security which is what Western Turkey now seems to enjoy, can be made the benefit.<br/><br/>The map should be redrawn too. Northern Iraq should be enveloped into the new arrangement. History shows that control of Eastern Anatolia + Northern Iraq (where some of Histories most decisive battles have been fought - Manzikert, Gaugamela) is necessary for control of Syria, Palestine &amp; Egypt.

The Foster Parent Diary, following this pattern, is written from the point of view of one foster parent. Ms. Walbert is no doubt aware of the importance of protecting the privacy of BlueJay's biological family especially since she is writing a series of first-person essays as opposed to performing investigative journalism. The other side of the story is extremely valuable too; perhaps Motherlode will run a Birth Parent Diary one day. In the meantime, Ms. Walbert writes about her own role with sensitivity and grace.<br/><br/>And yes, it's very important for the biological parents to access help for any issues. The goal of foster care is reunification; caseworkers work with biological families too. Should interventions benefit only the child and biological family and \"not the foster family\" though? I'm not sure why they have to be mutually exclusive.

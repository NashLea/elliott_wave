Both programs are paid for through payroll taxes deducted over many working years and are earned benefits for the elders who receive them. And as any elder will tell you, we continue to pay premiums on Medicare to the tune of about $100 per month deducted from our Social Security checks. The difference, as Molly and others have detailed here, is in not having to go \"hat in hand\" to welfare offices to apply for food stamps, since Social Security and Medicare are, again, EARNED, not handouts.

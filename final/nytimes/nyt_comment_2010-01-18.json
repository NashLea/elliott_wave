Funny how many of the negative, macho pro-Jets comments come from people who don't bother to leave their last names. To those first name types, I don't believe that I am actually a sore loser; I've been a Chargers fan far too long to be that!  (To those of you unfamiliar with our franchise history, we have never won a Super Bowl, have only attended one, and typically choke in clutch moments like this one.  We're very accustomed to losing.)  In fact, I'm pretty sure I admitted in my earlier comment that my team truly did not deserve to win that football game.  And if you'd ever watched a football game with me you'd know that I always admit it when the other team gives us a good, old-fashioned you-know-what kicking.  (The Niners did in Superbowl 29; the Jets didn't tonight.)  So feel free to criticize my analysis of the game, but don't write it off as sour grapes -- that's unsportmanslike conduct on your part, not too different from kicking a challenge flag.<br /><br />And I will admit that Walt and other commenters have a point, and sometimes a good team shows its greatness not with flash but simply by making other teams look bad.  That may or may not be true of the Jets -- I guess we'll see next week.  But you all have to admit: you simply can't \"force\" some of the mistakes made by the Chargers team today.  Nate Kaeding's failures (especially when compared to his nearly flawless record) were ours alone, and those unearned points could be said to have caused your win. I realize that you can never blame a loss entirely on any one or two missed plays, and that if we had made those field goals, you might have responded to them.  But you can't deny that they played a huge (and perhaps determining) role in your win.<br /><br />So congratulations, Jets fans.  Enjoy tonight's glory.  But as a final note I'll echo my mom -- a New Jersey born San Diegan, with ties to both teams -- and say that based on the way they played tonight, neither team looked like one who would (or should) end up playing in the Super Bowl.  So take this week to figure out how to get your offense into the red zone often and early, without relying on penalties and interceptions for field position.  And maybe, just maybe you'll make the Colts look as bad as the Chargers.<br /><br />I might kind of enjoy that, too.

So I just want to say to those GOP members bragging about killing health care reform in 1994 congrats in that time 720,000 Americans have died from lack of insurance \"45,000\" americans die every year from lack of recieving proper medical attention. You know i wonder what those who fight getting everyone quality health care would say if Jesus were on earth cause in the bible they cast the sick aside to an island and Jesus went to them. To quote jesus \"how you treat the least of my people the poor, THE SICK and the imprisoned is how you treat me\" of course if Jesus said that today Shaun, Rush and Glenn would say watch out for this socialist.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1063877, "replies": [], "lft": 68, "assetURL": "http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/democrats-back-up-health-plan-ask-house-to-back-senate-bill/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1428118, "rgt": 69, "userDisplayName": "William", "createDate": "1263781802", "userID": 59948843, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1263792480", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chandler, AZ.", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1263792480", "commentSequence": 24, "commentBody": "If obama back doors this health plan he'll leave the wh the same way.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1063877, "replies": [], "lft": 66, "assetURL": "http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/democrats-back-up-health-plan-ask-house-to-back-senate-bill/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1428109, "rgt": 67, "userDisplayName": "indepthinker", "createDate": "1263781348", "userID": 59413037, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1263792512", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Bay area, California", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1263792512", "commentSequence": 25, "commentBody": "There are two major mistaken statements by the author of this article.  First, the health care bill will not be \"far reaching health care legislation.\"  Pelosi and House Democrats have indicated they will surrender on most of the differences with the Senate bill, resulting in a relatively weak House bill being diluted to a weaker overall bill.<br /><br />Second, most people seem to be predicting there will be no health care bill if Brown wins the Senate election Tuesday.  This is an insult to the intelligence of most people and a scare tactic being used by Democrats to try to sway some voters in Massachusetts.<br /><br />A health care bill could be still be passed, but Obama and the vast majority of Democrats would have to compromise with a few Republicans, which they do not want to do at this stage.  Obama seems desperate to have a health care bill passed before his state of the union speech, so he can have something to brag about.

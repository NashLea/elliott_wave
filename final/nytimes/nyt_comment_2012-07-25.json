When I think of Mr. Hemsley, and the hilarity that ensued when he was on screen, week in and week out on The Jeffersons, I think of the great Lucille Ball.  His talent was that great.  Yet, Mr. Hemsley could also be effective in those tender moments, sometimes required when the script called for George Jefferson, to swallow his pride, check his ego, or reflect.

The tri-state tornado of 1925 remains America's most deadly on record, when the population was a third of what it is now. There's few meterological records of tornados before 1925, as there was little technology and fewer people around  to photograph let alone record them. The Xenia Ohio outbreak of 1974 was also horrific. What we have have in the USA  are lots of pseudoscientists jumping to conclusions to to fudge the data to deliver their desired outcome, free taxpayer money in the form of dubious climate change research grants. It's more than psuedoscience, it's a slap in the face to last week's victims who need more tornado shelters, and better tornado path prediction. Real scientists would better work on tornado prediction and warning systems. ", "recommendationCount": 13}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

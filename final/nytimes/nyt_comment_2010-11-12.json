Just as my post quoted the folks at Potsdam correctly, they cannot find AGW or any GW in line with anything suggested by the IPCC and by extension, Hansen or the former consensus.<br /><br />\" In a paper published in 2003, using their own studies, the authors concluded there had been no global warming over the last decades. (J.F. Eichner, E. Koscielny-Bunde, A. Bunde, S. Havlin, and H.-J. Schellnhuber: Power-law persistence and trends in the atmosphere, a detailed study of long temperature records, Phys. Rev. E 68 2003),<br /><br />The temperature records of 95 stations distributed over the globe were studied. In the paper\u2019s summary discussion, Schellnhuber and his colleagues wrote:<br /><br />    In the vast majority of stations we did not see indications for a global warming of the atmosphere.<br /><br />and<br /><br />    Most of the continental stations where we observed significant trends are large cities where probably the fast urban growth in the last century gave rise to temperature increases.<br /><br />And la pi\u00e8ce de resistance!<br /><br />    The fact that we found it difficult to discern warming trends at many stations that are not located in rapidly developing urban areas may indicate that the actual increase in global temperature caused by anthropogenic perturbation is less pronounced than estimated in the last IPCC Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.\"<br /><br />In other words, when the actual data are examined, by warmists themselves it shows no AGW, for decades, then other warmists 'adjust' the data at which point, like magic, AGW appears.<br /><br />These warm-biased adjustments are shockingly coarse, because no one ever expected anyone to examine them who were not in the 'clique', (those of climategate), but now we are.  What is seen is stunning in its audacity and in its warming=-effect on the final calculations - at least 0.5 degrees of added global warming - and as we know - see above, the folks at Potsdam cannot find any GW anyways.<br /><br />There remains no objective data to establish that AGW exists within the real climate (though I accept that it may to some very small amount), and the data that is considered mainstream went from Potsdam's results to warmists results via adjustments not because there was unusual warming in the raw data.<br /><br />Do not take my word for it - take your fellows, or examine it yourself and see, that is what I did - the data are very clear, as Schellnhuber said so well:<br /><br />\"  The fact that we found it difficult to discern warming trends at many stations that are not located in rapidly developing urban areas may indicate that the actual increase in global temperature caused by anthropogenic perturbation is less pronounced than estimated in the last IPCC Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.\"<br /><br />We can argue about the data, but really the best arbiter or validity check are the oceans, are they warming and rising is melt accumulating all at an accelerated or faster pace, getting faster and faster as we have had experienced these last two decades one hotter than the next and both very hot (according to the warmists theocracy), the answers are that the oceans rise has slowed not sped, and that it has never broken its multi-century trends and that it is not warming as the models predict - as a result the IPCC calls for a mean rise of just 29 cm by 2100 with a low band of 14 cm - many other mainstream ocean experts are expecting about 1.1 - 1.6 mm/yr +/- overall, in other words, nothing unusual or outside the long-trends.<br /><br />C02 correlation with climate, no trend:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://c3headlines.typepad.com/.a/6a010536b58035970c0120a6614a9c970c-pi\" target=\"_blank\">http://c3headlines.typepad.com...</a><br /><br />Back to the topic - Obama/Browner - a fraud - Bush/McClellan - in step with objective data - yet far too gentle for my tastes, they should have had the full courage of their convictions and said it like we are now.

Collins, Chicago<br /><br />Dear Mr. Collins,<br /><br />Might I persuade you to re-read my #30 with, perhaps, a little more attention than you gave it at first glance?<br /><br />The elderly I described, dying in winter due to energy poverty, were (and sadly, are) in England, in the UK.<br /><br />Not, as you write in your #45, in New England, in the US.  I've never lived in New England and know nothing about energy poverty or its opposite in the region.<br /><br />My # 30 is quite clear that the unfortunates under discussion were in England. Not New England.<br /><br />This distinction makes a considerable nonsense of your parenthetical speculation \"(I suspect this [death of the elderly due to energy poverty]  happens far less in modern Western Europe, one of the benefits of their quasi-socialism, but I don't know.)\"<br /><br />The UK is geographically and politically part of \"modern Western Europe\" with all the \"benefits\" of \"quasi-socialism\". Yet for decades the appalling \"winter kill\" of elderly pensioners too poor to heat their homes properly has continued to a greater or lesser extent.<br /><br />Firstly, energy costs were kept artificially high, by tariffs of a factor of about 500%, as protectionism for politically untouchable unionized coal-miners.  In the eighties, Welsh coal cost 125 pounds sterling per ton. This was a time when, without those tariffs, coal from Wyoming could have been mined, shipped by rail and barge across half the continental United States and by freighter across the Atlantic Ocean, to Liverpool, for a delivered cost of 21 pounds sterling per ton.<br /><br />Margaret Thatcher broke the unions in the eighties. But eye-watering taxes on energy had become a necessary staple of government spending, and thus were not abandoned.<br /><br />For example, in my time there, motor fuel in Britain cost 400% more than it did in the US, with 75% of the price being tax.<br /><br />Just lately the UK has faced soaring electricity costs due to an earnest governmental desire to use renewables to reduce GHG emissions, mainly by wind power,  instead of more economical methods of electricity production.<br /><br />The energy poverty of UK pensioners has been an acknowledged national scandal for decades.  There is a government subsidy which attempts to bridge the gap between what energy costs and what pensioners can afford.  The size and adequacy of this subsidy are constant topics of dispute in British electoral politics.<br /><br />So why, I wonder, did your eyes read \"New England\" when I wrote \"England\"?<br /><br />And why were you so eager to believe the worst about our native land and believe, against the evidence, that \"modern Western Europe\" with its \"quasi-socialism\" would have \"far less\" energy poverty?<br /><br />Do you automatically assume that callous, hard-hearted indifference is the norm in America?<br /><br /> And do you just as automatically assume that the \"quasi-socialists\" of \"modern Western Europe\" are by deed and thought kinder, gentler, more caring than your fellow countrymen?<br /><br />If such assumptions underlie your #45, they need radical adjustment to bring them in line with reality.

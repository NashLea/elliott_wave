Why not do away with the bake sale altogether, then? Have a dance-off instead, or have children raise fruit and vegetables which they can then sell, if we are so concerned about students' health. The foods currently served in school cafeterias, and those the Dept of Ed is trying to promote at bake sales would never be served in my home, for my family. Although my baked goods may not comply with their health standards, the foods they offer and promote in schools do not comply with mine.<br />That being said, here is a recipe for carrot cake I adapted from Cooking Light magazine (no affiliation, I just subscribe to their magazine). I decreased the original recipe's quantity of sugar in the frosting. And I bake these as cupcakes instead of a cake if I am taking them to a bake sale. I made little notes for the changes I usually make when baking this. Nutritional information can be found on Cooking Light's website.<br /><br />Fruity Carrot Cake<br />\u2022\tCake:<br />\u2022\t1 1/2  cups  all-purpose flour (about 6 3/4 ounces)<br />\u2022\t1 1/3  cups  granulated sugar<br />\u2022\t1/2  cup  sweetened flaked coconut<br />\u2022\t1/3  cup  chopped pecans (I don't put these in because I don't like nuts in my cake!)<br />\u2022\t2  teaspoons  baking soda<br />\u2022\t1  teaspoon  salt (I actually use about \u00bd teaspoon because my salt is salty)<br />\u2022\t2  teaspoons  ground cinnamon (I also use ground cloves, nutmeg, etc and throw it all in- no measurements)<br />\u2022\t3  tablespoons  canola oil<br />\u2022\t2  large eggs<br />\u2022\t2  cups  grated carrot (If I have apples or pears lying around, I do 1 cup grated apple/pear and 1 cup carrot)<br />\u2022\t1 1/2  cups  canned crushed pineapple, drained<br />\u2022\tI add raisins and dried cranberries<br />\u2022\tCooking spray<br />\u2022<br />Frosting:<br />\u2022\t2  tablespoons  butter, softened<br />\u2022\t1  (8-ounce) block 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened<br />\u2022\t3  cups  powdered or confectioners sugar (I NEVER use this much sugar!! Maybe 1 \u00bd cups, maybe 2, depending on my mood)<br />\u2022\t2  teaspoons  vanilla extract<br />\u2022\tAdditional grated carrot (optional)<br />\u2022\tI also add cinnamon, ground cloves, nutmeg to this frosting. It makes the cake look pretty and it tastes better.<br /><br />Preparation<br />Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.<br />To prepare cake, lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flour, sugar, coconut, pecans, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon/spices in a large bowl; stir well with a whisk. Combine oil and eggs; stir well. Stir egg mixture, grated carrot, and pineapple into flour mixture. Spoon batter into a 13 x 9-inch baking pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 35 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely on a wire rack. **If making cupcakes, divide the batter between 20-24 cupcake tins lined with liners. Bake until golden brown, or until wooden toothpick comes out clean, about 35 min.<br />To prepare frosting, combine butter and cream cheese in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer at medium speed until smooth. Beat in powdered sugar, vanilla, and spices just until smooth. Spread frosting over top of cake/cupcakes. Garnish each serving with grated carrot, if desired, or sprinkle with your favorite spice.<br />", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1248621, "replies": [], "lft": 56, "assetURL": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/q-and-a-espresso-at-home/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1692684, "rgt": 57, "userDisplayName": "PE", "createDate": "1268504043", "userID": 28207797, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268630600", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Carlisle, PA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268627000", "commentSequence": 22, "commentBody": "I have a collection of all sorts of discarded coffee makers, from the beautifully crafted Alessi stainless steel stovetop model to the $5 clunky-cute Bialetti roughly cast aluminum contraption that every Italian owns. However, they are all now on a basement shelf, unlikely to be used again. After switching to the Nespresso system, I save myself (and my spouse) from all the fuss/mess/noise of grinding, measuring, tamping--etc.--for what was always a second rate cup of espresso. It was a like a nice Italian sports car: when it worked well (about once a month and when you least expected it to), it was a lot of fun, but most of the time it was one big headache. If you live alone and have nothing but time and patience for pointless rituals that rival those of the papacy, keep the old stove top models. For me, I've finally become a true coffee secularist and have join the ranks of Nespresso.  Although the system is more expensive up front and over time (about double the cost per cup), the results are downright Germanic in their precision, quality, and reliability. No mess, no fuss, less time, much less noisy than a grinder, and by far the best coffee I've ever produced, day in, day out. Also, for foaming milk, the Nespresso areocinio is by far the greatest invention. No more disappointing results. It produces exactly the same amount of generous foam, every time, automatically. Clean up is easy as well. While I wish the coffee cartridges were available in grocery stores, shipments arrive 24 hours after order. The only downside is that I nearly tripled my daily coffee intake--it's that good. Also, it's very fast, which is essential for dinner parties. I can pop out single espresso shots in under 10 second each.  When I need extra storage space, I'll toss out all my old espresso pots soon, saving only the Alessi as an inspiring example of 20th century contemporary sculpture.

Undoing the damage to my daughter's self-image is our next challenge.  For so long she would cry out of her frustration, because she didn't know what was \"wrong\" with her -- and unfortunately neither did anyone else.

From age two she seldom slept more than seven hours at night and never napped.  But she was generally a well-behaved child:  never loud or aggressive, friendly, eager to please and very bright.\r<br/><br/>When the family went to spend a year in France my daughter was four, and, true to form, she surprised me with one of her first actions in our rental home \u2013 she found scissors and \"trimmed\" the fringe on the rug in her room.  But after a month or so I suddenly realized that she had calmed down.  There was no more inventive destruction, no mini-whirlwind, and she slept longer.  I was thankful, mystified and wanted to find out why.\r<br/><br/>I finally decided that the source of the difference in my daughter lay in the food.  After all this time I cannot remember the exact numbers, but my recollection is that in France fewer than a dozen food colors were permitted.  At the same time the FDA permitted more than 40.\r<br/><br/>When we returned to the States I carefully monitored my daughter's diet and gradually reintroduced her to prepared foods.  We ate very few of these because I loved to cook and my husband and sons, being very athletic, had huge appetites.  But we did eat hot dogs about once a week.  No more.  Red dye.\r<br/><br/>It was, as another commenter wrote, like a switch.  Hot dogs, lunch meats in general, strawberry jam, chocolate in commercial cookies, drinks and cake mixes \u2013 and more \u2013 were no longer part of my daughter's diet.  When it was obvious that these couldn't be avoided, at birthday parties for instance, they were permitted.  Then the rest of the family engaged in a kind of relay to keep my daughter physically active and busy so she'd be able to sleep that night.\r<br/><br/>After a few years, by the age of eight or so, the restrictions were in place only after 4 pm as my daughter seemed to have a lessened susceptibility.  But almost 30 years later she told me that she had instituted a similar \"curfew\" on herself because of her own discovery that there were some foods that kept her awake at night.\r<br/><br/>This experience certainly made me wonder why on earth the US population has to be pumped full of these chemicals?  This story is a single anecdote, but the cause was tested again and again with the same effect.  Happily that effect was relatively benign, but it might be much worse for a child with heightened sensitivity.  While anecdotal evidence doesn't prove the hypothesis, it can certainly make the case for parental caution and for the need of a well designed, scrupulously conducted scientific study.", "recommendationCount": 15}, {"assetID": 2578385, "replies": [], "lft": 134, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/health/policy/30fda.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3615622, "rgt": 135, "userDisplayName": "Ktree", "createDate": "1301456458", "userID": 58454902, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1301457931", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Pac NW", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1301454331", "commentSequence": 63, "commentBody": "Vote with your pocketbook.

Loss of life depends on deadly places, and economic loss depends on valuation of damaged property. In Japan, the tsunami zone was the top \"deadly place\" in which a high proportion of fatalities occurred. The built environment outside the tsunami zone sustained massive and costly damage, but caused comparatively little loss of life.<br/><br/>Here in the Pacific Northwest we have two especially \"deadly places\": the tsunami zone, and our aging public schools plus other unreinforced masonry buildings in historic districts and town centers. The issue here is neither affluence nor poverty, but the fact that our (modern, western) built environment was largely constructed decades before the first evidence showed that great earthquakes could be expected here.We built for one environment, and now find ourselves in quite another.<br/><br/>Oregon's population is about 25% larger than the 3 million in northeast Japan, and not so concentrated on the coast. But our buildings are terribly vulnerable, and on school days more than 561,000 Oregon children are in public school classrooms. The share of our population that spends about 200 days each year in one of our state's deadliest places gives no cause for complacency.", "recommendationCount": 15}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

First, you can use reactors that will consume most of the waste that is generated.  Once that is done, you can store what is left over in pools of water until most of the highly radioactive material is gone as the short half-life materials decay.  What is left over can be encased in small glass spheres and dumped into the very deep ocean where it can do no harm.  Keep in mind that gravity will keep the waste well away from human beings and life near the surface.  Even if some of the material leaches out into the ocean there will be no difference to the radioactivity levels because anything produced by man will be dwarfed by the amount of radioactive potassium that is naturally found in the ocean and the other radioactive materials brought to the ocean bottom by natural volcanic activity.  Waste disposal has never really been a real problem from a scientific or environmental perspective.  It has always been a political problem that has been tainted by ideology.

In India, in the current decade (2000-2010) the temperature increase was less than 0.06 degrees Celsius which was also the case for the globe. The extreme temperatures recorded during 2002 and 2009 are associated with extreme dry conditions.  My studies on solar energy &amp; evaporation also show the impact of dry and wet conditions in a given location (a review of these were given in Solar Energy journal 1987). As per as Revkins observation, emissions control, it is an important issue, as it is a pollution, in terms its impact on health of life forms including soil.  Therefore, there is a need to look emission controls in this direction by identifying areas and control measures.

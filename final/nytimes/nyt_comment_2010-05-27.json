It was not clear whether this energy could be released explosively however.<br />Szilard, as always, was both a man of vision and a man of action. Well known among European physicists, Szilard drafted a letter in consultation with Albert Einstein that was addressed from Einstein to President F.D. Roosevelt and which warned hime of the possibility of nuclear weapons (the \"Einstein Letter\"). This letter was delivered to FDR on October 11, 1939, and ten days later the first meeting of the Advisory Committee on Uranium (the \"Briggs Uranium Committee\") was held in Washington, DC on Pres. Roosevelt's order.<br />Despite its official founding in August, the Manhattan Project really began on September 17, 1942 when Col. Leslie Richard Groves was notified at 10:30 a.m. by Gen. Brehon Somervell that his assignment overseas had been cancelled. Groves, an experienced manager who had just overseen the colossal construction of the Pentagon, seized immediate and decisive control. In just two days he resolved issues that had dragged on for months under Compton. On September 18 Groves ordered the purchase of 1250 tons of high quality Belgian Congo uranium ore stored on Staten Island, and the next day purchased 52000 acres of land to be the future site of Oak Ridge. Groves was promoted to Brigadier General on September 23. By September 26 Groves had secured access to the highest emergency procurement priority then in existence.<br />The era of weak, indecisive leadership was over.<br />Groves' pushy, even overbearing, demeanor won him few friends among the scientists on the Manhattan Project (in particular a special enmity developed between Groves and Szilard). Many detested him at the time, considering him a boor and a buffoon. It was only after the war that many scientists began to appreciate how crucial his organizational and managerial genius was.<br />By the start of 1945 the Manhattan Project had 'turned the corner'. The uranium bombs seemed assured of success in a matter of months. The prospects for the plutonium bomb were looking up although meeting an August 1 deadline imposed by Groves was far from certain. However, allied military successes against Germany and Japan made it a horse race to see whether it would matter to the war effort.

There are many parties at fault here including BP and regulators, but the nation is also to blame for its refusal to change its habits with respect to oil use and energy, or to implement measures that would provide us with incentives to change our habits and change the necessity of needing to keep drilling for more and more oil.  Other developed countries have managed to do this; so should we be able to do this, but because we have not done this already, we're stuck relying too much on oil for now.  Moving away from oil, however, is likely to encounter resistance in the Gulf region as these states are dependent on the oil industry for many well-paying jobs.  It is precisely because of this dependence, however, that the oil industry, with the help of regulators who were not doing their jobs, operates with seeming impunity and cavalierly created this mess.  The only way to keep this from happening again is for the Gulf states to diversify their industries instead of relying so much on the oil industry; their new industries should be in the green economy - batteries for EVs, solar panels and wind turbines to replace oil in cars, charging station parts, and research to improve and innovate all things to do with energy.  This is already happening elsewhere - in CA there are several small EV ventures coming into their own and big players like Nissan have sold out their first wave of pure electric cars before even coming into showrooms this fall, and Toyota just formed a partnership with Tesla, a small but high profile EV player.  The same goes for solar panels and wind turbines.  The demand is there and the products are slowly coming.  But too much is coming from China, and we will be switching our reliance on oil for a reliance on China.  If the Gulf states get in early, they can be at the forefront as we change our energy and transportation systems and manufacture our own products without relying on China; if they do not, they will be left behind as the need for oil begins to taper off, becoming the equivalent of the rust-belt of 30 years ago, and we may not have enough capacity elsewhere in the country to keep the nation independent and a leader in these new areas.<br /><br />The oil companies and other vested interests will fight it with misinformation and threats, but the people need to fight back and dictate to big oil for a change.  Don't let big oil continue to dictate to those who they provide jobs to and those who rely on their product - diversifying the gulf economies will dilute industry power and their ability to dictate to the Gulf states and to the United States, and it will help the United States recover and compete better in the world.<br /><br />As for those who have suffered, the U.S. government will make sure BP and other responsible parties, including regulators, pay for damages even if it means seizing companies and individual assets.  Why should a fisherman's life be destroyed when an oil manager or regulator who did not do their job continue to live a comfortable life?

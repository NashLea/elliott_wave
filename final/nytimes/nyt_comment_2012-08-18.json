We have no illusions, no hubris that we would be great parents, no insecurity  children complete our lives/marriage and no sense these children need \"saving\" and we be \"saviours\". We reckon we will live the average human lifespan, and perhaps in that time help someone with whatever means we have. We will register and see what happens.<br/><br/>Some people think this is a rather \"random\" approach. But I think it is about as random as getting pregnant and not knowing how the child may turn out. I think it's part of our humanity, not destiny. We might adopt a child who grows up one day with deep anger issues, and all I can say is we will help that child manage that anger. We will help raise him/her especially with health and identity issues. I can have the best intentions but the relationship will pan out depending on the dynamics of any relationship.

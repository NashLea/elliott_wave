The toll increases affect EVERYONE: Bus fares must increase, the PATH fare increase begins at $.50 per round trip. PATH is a subway-like train running from Newark, NJ through Hoboken and Jersey City to 34th St in Manhattan. Many, if not most PATH &amp; bus riders have a connecting bus, train or car fare in addition to the Port Authority's fee. The cost of goods and services will increase: the truck tolls will begin at $2.00 per axle. And all these tolls will increase to discouraging levels by 2015. Few can expect a pay raise or more business revenue that will match the toll increases. This was a done deal. A despicable deal. Public hearing were announced at the last minute, scheduled in out-of-the-way locations at times difficult for many commuters - who are working longer hours or a 2nd job to make ends meet. The \"last minute\" toll changes were planned. As a union member (SEIU) I'm ashamed of my brothers and sisters who were planted at the hearings &amp; encouraged to behave like performing seals.

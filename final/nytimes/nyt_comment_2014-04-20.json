There was a civil rights demonstration underway, and the construction workers, drinking beer, were attempting to pick fights with the demonstrators.  The demonstrators were very restrained.  There were lots of news photographers around, and I was afraid I would be in the newspaper holding a Schaefer beer.   Later we had lunch at Chung King, and a waitress dressed to look Chinese dumped an entire meal in a businessman's fedora.  I was looking around for Allen Funt.   It seemed that every third world country had a truck tire on display, to show how advanced their industry was.   Later, at the Brass Rail, we had free dinner, because there was nobody at the end of the cafeteria line manning the cash register.    I also remember the IBM \"people wall\", an almost vertical grandstand that hydraulically raised you into an egg shaped theater.

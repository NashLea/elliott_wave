Life was challenging but I think its given me a perspective on identity and reconciliation that could be very useful.<br /><br />On that front, I recenty co-launched a piece of work called Blood Across Boundaries. We are suggesting that mixedness need not remain in the realm of cultural curiosity but actually has real hard political implications. We have a proposition: That people of mixed heritage (racial, ethnic or religious) have a unique, but as yet untapped, contribution to make to the way we do national and international politics around identity, conflict, peace and reconciliation. Under this banner we want to explore questions such as: How does a person whose parents come from either side of a conflict understand, live with, or overcome that conflict? What contribution could people of mixed heritage make to the way political leaders frame national discourse around \u201cbelonging\u201d and \u201cnot belonging\u201d? Can those insights be scaled up to meaningfully inform and direct the development of national and international policy in the areas of identity, conflict, peace and reconciliation? If so how? What impact could a growing mixedness in the US, UK and around the world (within individuals and across the national) have on the understanding of personal belonging and international relations?<br /><br />We are looking for people to help us with this thinking.

For me, exposure to contrasting ideas, traditions, and means, paved a way in my heart towards openness, comprehension, and respect of culture. In the same vein, exposure to differences in race and ethnicity, the persons that value them, and the lessons learned from them, could also lead to mutual understanding and eventual respect for such differences.<br /><br />Race, ethnicity, and culture are wonderful concepts to the extent that they make us unique. They are also wonderful in that they bind us together. However, they are also sensitive subjects. In the path toward mutual understanding, we may never be able to avoid giving or taking offense. The least we can do is have compassion for one another. The least we can do is strive for deeper understanding for the things that make us different and also the things that make us so much alike. Anyone, regardless of race, color, or creed, can believe in a higher idea of unity. There are those of us with faith in a higher power. We would do well to apply those lessons of faith toward believing in the best in one another.<br /><br />Put another way, a very wise man once said: \u201cLove your neighbor as you love yourself.\u201d This message instructs compassion for all people, everywhere, while fundamentally implying our common humanity.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 2357569, "replies": [], "lft": 528, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/us/30mixed.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3315084, "rgt": 529, "userDisplayName": "piotrorloff", "createDate": "1296433818", "userID": 44213964, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1296454051", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Portland, OR", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1296454051", "commentSequence": 208, "commentBody": "I jokingly refer to myself as an Ethnic Oregonian.

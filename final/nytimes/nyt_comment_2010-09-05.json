They were warm, caring and so family oriented. Yet so many Americans including some of my own Italian American relatives view them with fear and anxiety.  We, through our media and fears are promoting this fear and it is so sad. Thank-You for reminding us. As a first generation Italian- American this country provided me with incredible opportunities. Please stay with the subject so we as Americans don't forget what this country has provided for us and not fall into the cycle of fear we worked so hard to break throught.<br />", "recommendationCount": 31}, {"assetID": 1817069, "replies": [], "lft": 46, "assetURL": "http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/is-islamophobia-the-new-hysteria/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2494031, "rgt": 47, "userDisplayName": "JC", "createDate": "1283657083", "userID": 1948827, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1283659289", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Michigan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1283655689", "commentSequence": 23, "commentBody": "Mr.Kristof, the controversy over the Islamic center near groud zero is not about fear-mongering or any sort of phobia.<br /><br />It has to do with respect for the folks who died in the September 11 attacks.

They react unthinkingly to any  change to the status quo with fear and intolerance.  The Republican Party has ridden this process to their success ever since 9/11.  The overall theme of Republicans (being conservative) is to profess ignorance as to the  outcome of any threat and just raise the fear of the unknown.  The Electorate reacts with support of this outlook.<br /><br />FDR was so right that we need fear only fear itself.  All problems can be resolved by our people with a reasoned approach: learn about the problem, consider reasonable responses to threats and select a rational course of action.  Observe results to measure progress in overcoming a problem, and modify actions to correct any missteps.  This  has worked for us  in this country for over 200 years.  Why are so many terrified of threats to our nation?  We have overcome so many obstacles with excellent results.  There is really no threat, today, that cannot be overcome.  So let's stay the course and move forward with courage and confidence.  The Glen Becks of today are diverting us with their programs of fear.  It should be beneath us.

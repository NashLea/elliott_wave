Who really cares. Find ways to reverse the trend.<br/><br/>We want it all, and we want it now. So take it.<br/><br/>Embrace the idea of having children at a younger age, early 20s. Work towards that vision - backwards engineering, like Vic Gundrota's take on product design. Start with the demo of how the finished product should work.<br/><br/>Some ideas of what we need:<br/>\n* rethink education &gt; it's all wrong. Too much emphasis on cognitive development, too little on intuition/emotional development. It costs way too much money and time. I say, aim at real case based learning from the start of school. Meaning, invite child labour in thru the back door, but this time, let the child decide what to do and how. Validate with real value. That's how kids learn - hearts and bellies, feet and hands. Help them learn how to create the value they need.<br/>\n* rethink childcare options. I vote \"community childcare,\" organised and staffed largely by parents themselves (ouderparticipatiecreche in Holland). I want to be involved in the daily activities and raising of my child, not park them in the early, most tender years of their life.<br/>\n* rethink money. What do you really need in life? How could you get that, does money come in at all?<br/>\n* role models. Roll out the read carpet for those who consciously chose to have children at an early age. I know they're out there. Invite them out to honour them and learn their lessons.<br/><br/>I hope our kids will start early on. Late mom, early grandma? I got their back, and will let them know.<br/><br/>Let's do this, mums, dad, grandparents, politicians, entrepreneurs, CEO's, and anyone who cares!<br/><br/>Written by an innovative mom - I wanted to have kids at 23, but didnt settle with my man before 24, and then didn't know it enough to convince him, myself, and just do it, trusting life to work itself out.

Over the past three decades, there have been \u201cas many as\u201d 315 bird-plane collisions each year.  The USDA decided, by methods not described, that a mere 5000 birds is an \u201cacceptable\u201d number.  If they mean to leave 5000 in NY state, that\u2019s quite a massacre they propose; if they mean only in the metro area, that\u2019s still a significant cull. The article doesn\u2019t mention the number of planes that fly over the city, but 300 collisions actually isn\u2019t much\u2014and even if you kill birds that are nesting near the airport, the famous Sullenberger landing in the Hudson River was forced by _migrating_ geese.  It is valid to ask whether culling birds on Riker\u2019s Island and Prospect Park is going to do much to reduce an already-low risk (a report covering 1912-2002 estimated that bird strikes cause 1 human death per 1 billion flying hours; needless to say, the birds come out much worse). <br/><br/>I will post the rest of my reply at <a href=\"http://wwwmiscellaneousmusings.blogspot.com/\" title=\"http://wwwmiscellaneousmusings.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://wwwmiscellaneousmusings.blogspot.com/</a>", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2911451, "replies": [], "lft": 88, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/nyregion/behind-affluent-image-connecticut-faces-economic-pain.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 4084645, "rgt": 89, "userDisplayName": "RGV", "createDate": "1309493540", "userID": 3906448, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1309493707", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Boston, MA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1309490107", "commentSequence": 39, "commentBody": "Connecticut's experience with trying to appease public worker unions validates the approach taken by the Republican governors in New Jersey, Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida and Maine.

I put off marrying and having a family because I could not juggle working 100+ hour weeks with anything else. It was really tough. I stuck with it, paid my dues, had lots of good luck, allowed a couple of years of experience to get under my belt, didn't give up on developing my personal life when I finally got a breather, and now w/. small kids, finally am reaping the reward.

Earplugs are highly recommended.<br /><br />However the positives are all good:<br /><br />1. You're located exactly where you want to be: a lot of the key sights and the main public transport routes are all very close by. The surrounding streets offer places to eat.<br />2. The rooms are good sized, clean and comfortable. None of the \"ususal suspects\" here - hot water was good and limitless, the bed was comfortable, the place was clean and modern, the furniture basic but not shabby.<br />3. The staff are friendly, excellent english speakers, they can arrange tours and other services if you ask them to.<br />4. Internet connectivity - wifi and a PC in the lobby.<br /><br />It is true that taxi drivers can't find it.

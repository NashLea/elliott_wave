It is inversely proportional the probability that the U.S. will collapse.<br/><br/>Therefore, the reason that money can't be derived from either macro or micro economics is because money is a barter commodity, which the sovereign transform into money by the political power of his fiat.  The value of money is not as a good or a commodity but is the result of the political authority of the sovereign, whose fiat decrees it to be a medium of exchange and a unit of value.  The status of fiat currency as money is based on the sovereign's decree, and its value of money depends on the sovereign's political power.<br/><br/>I'll leave the equations for you as an exercise.

If there is any doubt about the sovereign's ability to enforce in trade and transactions its decree that a commodity will be the medium of exchange and a unit of value and/or in the sovereign's ability to maintain money's value, then the value of that commodity as money becomes unstable and may proceed to collapse.  <br/><br/>If the Eurozone's instant troubles cause the public to lose faith in the euro as money, e.g., as was true for Weimar Republic or Confederate dollars at the end of the Civil War, the euro will provide the latest natural experiment in to prove that money's value is the sovereign's decree that it is money and the public's faith in the power of that decree."}]}, "lft": 340, "assetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/theres-something-about-money-implicitly-wonkish/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 14101357, "rgt": 345, "userDisplayName": "Chanson de Roland", "createDate": "1423630783", "userID": 10494, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1423630808", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1423630808", "commentSequence": 14101357, "commentBody": "Come on Paul; you guys, the macro-economists, can figure out why people value money, which is usually just a piece of paper with writing and a pretty design on it, in terms of real goods and bonds.

Patients may even have financial incentives, such as a reason for taking time off from work without penalty.\" Is this your own theory or do you know therapists personally? <br/><br/>You state this as if you think these are major motivators for therapists. I can assure you (after being in the field for 30+ years) that most are NOT primarily motivated by money. They're generally motivated by the desire to help people, curiosity about the human mind, other less tanglible values. Most of my colleagues, talented New York therapists, are not fabulously weathy; most make less than their patients. Many therapists routinely lower fees, especially if an established patient has a crisis (such as losing a job).<br/><br/>If someone is mostly motivated by financial incentives, he/she chooses a much more lucrative field requiring little to no advanced education (MA, MD, PhD), exams/certifications, continuing ed costs. all out of pocket.<br/><br/>When one uses the primary criteria of \"financial incentive\" it extends a business (profit) model and projects it on others who do not primarily share these values. Of course, there are some greedy practioners. Most therapists want to make a decent living but they more want to help their patients get well. <br/><br/>Your comment that \"patients may even have financial incentives\" is absurd and reductionistic.

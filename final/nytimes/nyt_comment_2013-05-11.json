Tuition revenue from those able to pay is also the source of most of the financial aid.<br/><br/>It is a sort of \"Robin Hood\" system.  You need to charge some students (or their parents) a lot more than the actual cost of providing instruction, so that you can charge others a lot less. <br/><br/>Thus how much aid any given school can afford, depends on how much tuition it gets from others paying above actual cost.<br/><br/>Leaving aside room and board, lets say the cost of providing instruction is $20K and the \"sticker price\" for tuition is $35K.<br/><br/>Then anyone paying above $20K is making a net contribution to financial aid.  If 5 merit scholarship at $5K are given to high achievers with little need, they will pay $30K each for a net over and above cost of $50k that can be used to provide financial aid to those who can less than 20K.<br/><br/>If actual cost is $20K, 2 students paying $30K can cover the cost of one paying $0.<br/><br/>You get some really talented students AND you end up with more financial aid to support high need students.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 3370248, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 8969485, "replies": [], "commentID": 8969727, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "DOS", "createDate": "1368245465", "userID": 55616298, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1368271080", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 1, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Informed Voter", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Philadelphia", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1368267480", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "An interesting false-flag variation of GOP talking points.

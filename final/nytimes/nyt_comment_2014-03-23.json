And, that further programming was done as the plane headed from waypoint to waypoint. A pilot suicide that involves flying around for 7 hours before crashing? In every other pilot suicide (mass murder) the guy points the plane's nose down, says his prayers and that's the end of it. <br/><br/>Let's posit, not a remotely controlled aircraft, but malware that was placed in the FMS to program changes, possibly spoof the pilots and knock everyone out through a steep climb and possibly cabin depressurization.<br/><br/>But all of that requires manual input or can be overridden by manual input?

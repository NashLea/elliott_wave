Unfortunately, in the digital age, once the story gets out there, it can't be recalled.  The damage is done.  This incident has as much to do with accurate reporting as it does about political manipulations.  Even Mr. Krugman has failed to mention that the 2 million job changes are spread out over 10 years.  His wording in this piece could give the impression that they will occur all at once.  <br/><br/>The Republicans have been manufacturing lies about the healthcare reform with abandon and this misinterpretation of an official non-partisan report will allow them some degree of false legitimacy.  I fully expect the wimpy Democratic political machine to treat it the same as all the others and utter the standard. \"We don't see it that way.\" <br/><br/>It is true that many older workers will retire when they can get affordable insurance on their own.  That will free up many positions and younger people will fill them.<br/><br/>There is another group that will also benefit greatly and they are younger people that want to start their own businesses.  A 35 year old with 3 kids can't take the chance to start a business because the insurance needed to protect the family could cost well over $15K.  The ACA will give them an opening.

That reduces the employer's leverage.<br/><br/>I've repeatedly have taken the position, and still do, that the American system is based upon only one principle: free contract. In that system, bargaining power is everything. What you earn is a function of it. The Rich/Republican know this. The concentration in wealth over the last 40 years is the result of the systematic attack, by the rich, against the agencies of other groups bargaining power, the most obvious cases were unions for workers, ACORN for the very poor, the cost and quality of education for the aspiring middle class.<br/><br/>The fire of the Republican response to the ACA makes no sense on the surface: it is, after all, their idea, their plan. However, it does make sense from the perspective of bargaining power analysis. Huge swings in earnings occur at marginal shifts in bargaining power. The Rich, the republicans know that. That's why they are rich.<br/><br/>Just a subtle shift in bargaining power is going to cause a disproportional shift in the distribution of earnings from the 1% to the 99%. If you could add 2.5 million jobs to the economy tomorrow, we'd be approaching full employment and it would show up in earnings and economic security to the 99%.

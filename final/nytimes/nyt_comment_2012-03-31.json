I think the argument that the Court has become political (especially in close, controversial cases like the health care law) is largely true. It's not an accident that the justices Barack Obama nominated look like they would vote to uphold the health care law, while those nominated by George W. Bush look likely to vote to strike it down. I'm not sure there's anything entirely \"wrong\" with this. If you're a conservative, you're going to agree with the conservative position on the judicial system, which tends to favor focusing on the actual text of the Constitution. If you're a liberal, you're going to agree with the liberal position, which tends to focus on fairness and empathy and things like that. Republican presidents will tend to nominate conservative judges, while Democratic presidents will tend to nominate liberal judges. It is what it is. Pretty much no matter what the judges decide in a case like this, one side or the other will be outraged and the other will be elated. That's a big part of the reason why winning presidential elections is so important because it lets the president (especially if he has the Senate on his side as well) nominate judges that are likely to rule the way the president favors for decades. In this case, I think that if the healthcare law is struck down, I don't think there will be too many negative consequences for the court because the law is so unpopular.

I have been volunteering in a senior care program for some time now, where we've had plenty of Alzheimer's sufferers. The fact is that it's not okay, it's hard as hell, especially on the primary caretaker, which is often an elderly spouse.  The emotional and physical toll on the caretaker has now been well-documented (including as reported in the article linked below). It feels like Mr. Snelling's attempts to be upbeat about it all finally broke down in the face of reality. I wonder if the persistent attempts at having a positive mental attitude kept him from seeking the help he needed both for himself and his wife.

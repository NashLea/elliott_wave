In spite of accepting tax payer funded \"secret grant money\" from Sheldon Silver, Dr. Taub did not and would not accept my sisters private insurance. I had informally appealed to the Chief Medical Officer, who I worked closely with at the time, but nothing could be done. True to form, Dr. Taub only took cash. In this respect he appears to have been very consistent. It should be noted that Dr Taub was only one of two practitioners on the east coast who claimed to treat mesothelioma, a Dr. Alexander was the other, at the University of Maryland. The truth is there is no specific treatment for it. Even Sloan Kettering had no treatment options. According to the the doctors at Sloane Kettering, Mesothelioma is not a true carcinoma, and the only treatment was extensive surgery and conventional chemo therapy much the same as is used to treat ovarian cancer.  We took my sister to Baltimore and she was treated there, but sadly she succumbed.  As for Dr. Taub and NY Presbyterian, as it were, they are now thinking, only of themselves. Dr. Taub is a government witness, granted immunity, and NY Presbyterian scapegoats and fires one of their own to salvage the organization's reputation. It seems it's still very cozy in Sheldon Sliver's universe of graft.

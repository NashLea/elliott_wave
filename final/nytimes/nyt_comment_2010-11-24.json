I will try to explain it.<br /><br />       In first case we have 5 stops and 10 floors .As  you explain it, each floor needs to be on ceil[f-1]/[s-1] ie 3 elevator stops. So this means that from each floor there are  4*3=12 different ways or connections of getting out of that floor.(ie 12 combinations obtained by combining 4 destination floors and 3 different elevators). This gives a total of 12 * 10 =120 combinations for all the stops/floors.<br />We will half this number to get 60 connections (as I am treating connection from floor  A to B and floor B to A as one connection.)<br />Each elevator with 5 stops provides us (5*4)/2 = 10 different connections.<br />Therefore 60 connections will require 6 floors.<br />Hope this explains my reasoning.<br /><br />We can use a similar approach for the second case.<br />The second case is little tricky. An elevator with 6 stops provides 15 connections.<br />A floor needs to be on 2 elevators to cover the 9 connections it needs.(again ceil   9/6 =2 as per your formula.) If it is on 2 elevators the floor has in all 5 +5 =10 connections .So the total connections come out to be (10 * 10) /2 = 50 which will be covered by 4 elevators.(4 elevators will provide 60 connections whereas 3 will provide 45, so we choose 4)", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2109828, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/opinion/24dowd.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2886540, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Phil in the mountains of Kyushu", "createDate": "1290566766", "userID": 58220231, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290579696", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Japan", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1290579696", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Such fakery happens so often.<br /><br />Do you remember the scene in \"Good Will Hunting\" where Will, played by Matt Damon, sent his friend (played by Ben Affleck) posing as Will to a job interview?

That BEF never returned. Graveyard of Empires. British Empire RIP.<br /><br />But, if one continues reading, Britain continued to look at the Afghanistan problem: they wanted the raids on the Raj and the threat of Russian encroachment stopped. So the Second British-Afghan War installed a member of the Afghani royalty as king, and he brought stability to the region. Afghanistan remained an independent nation, not part of the Raj, and not even a British neo-colony. But the Afghani raids on the Raj stopped until '47, when the Raj was dissolved, and Russian encroachment was stopped for almost a century. So victory for the British, if one takes the right definition of victory.<br /><br />***<br /><br />When the Soviets marched into Afghanistan, the right-wing Times columnists mourned that the US had elected a loser who had finally, irrevocably lost the Great Game.<br /><br />But then, after 9 years, the Afghan forces did not march triumphantly into Moscow, so it wasn't a clear defeat for the USSR, it was just a realisation the the word for 'victory' was pronounced 'da svidanya.'<br /><br />But when the costs of the Soviet Afghan adventure were tallied, they proved to be more than the USSR could afford, so the USSR completely disintegrated. Graveyard of Empires. USSR RIP.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Meanwhile, the fact that the British were taken in by the latest fraud means that they seem to have lost whatever expertise they once had about the region.<br /><br />But the war is squandering a lot of money. So much that, when yesterday's Times article said that the fraudster was paid 'a lot of money,' I thought they meant serious money. Today, Ms. Dowd says it was only in the low six figures, an amount lost in the round-off error.<br /><br />Still, trillions are being squandered (admittedly, an much smaller fraction of the total US economy compared with the fraction of their economy that the Soviets squandered), and that money is ending up in some pockets somewhere.<br /><br />So, from the point of view of the decision makers who are continuing the war, it's not at all stupid, it's just profitable.", "recommendationCount": 342}, {"assetID": 2109828, "replies": [], "lft": 36, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/opinion/24dowd.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2886919, "rgt": 37, "userDisplayName": "RosiesDad", "createDate": "1290573197", "userID": 10482944, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1290579696", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Wayne, PA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1290579696", "commentSequence": 12, "commentBody": "Add this to the growing list of reasons to get out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.<br />", "recommendationCount": 223}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

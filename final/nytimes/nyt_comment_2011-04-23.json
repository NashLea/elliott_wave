In my opinion, it is the oil and gas industry which is behind much of our country's woes as well as one of the largest culprits in the destruction of our planet.<br/><br/>Let me explain my hypothesis.  I have been learning a great deal about what is going on with our debt, budget, jobs, education, women's rights, programs for children, etc, etc, etc but I keep coming up with one pervasive thought - all this chaos serves a purpose.  We are all so busy surviving and worrying about what is going to happen next (politically/economically - pretty much one in the same) that we are not seeing what is happening before our very eyes.  We, as human beings and most other life on our planet, are at great risk of not being able to survive the environment we are creating (or rather, destroying).  Case in point, Bush exempted the oil/gas industries from the purview of the Clean Water and Drinking Water Act (in 2004-2005).  Look at the fervor around eradicating the EPA (in the short term settling for greatly reducing budgets for it).  Look at this industry's impact on the tenor of congress vis a vis financial backing of the candidates now in office.  Look at the ever increasing profits and overall proliferation of this industry's effect on law and policy.  Look at the frenzy created through manipulation of gas prices, all the blame that ensues, and the fear that immobilizes people as they pull out their wallets to pay for filling-up or heating their homes. <br/><br/>Both \"Gasland\" and \"11th Hour\" are documentaries that speak to the points I am making.  The former documents what is happening in our country regarding 'hydrofracking' and the resultant poisoning of our waters, which includes our drinking water (for g-d's sake!!!).  The later interviews renowned scientists from around the world who are all in agreement with each other and who have independently come to similar conclusions based upon scientific evidence and data - that catastrophic changes are happening on our planet. They are all in further agreement that we do not have decades to change our course, it needs to happen now.  The largest culprit on our path of self-destruction is our addiction to fossil fuels and our reluctance to change our patterns/habits.  And we must not forget, this goliath industry will do anything to maintain its stronghold on our country and world. <br/><br/>So, I am hypothesizing that the fossil fuel industry is a huge influence on the \u2018mood\u2019 of our country.  By censuring the media (look at how many stations and newspapers are owned by who), financing politicians, and backing the 'conservative think tanks', the result is unbridled power to shape legislative priorities, judicial decisions, budgetary priorities, tax laws, military budgets and the demise of environmental policy.  All this chaos serves a diabolical purpose: to prevent our refocus on serious renewable energy so it can maintain its own life and enormous profits; to keep us (the populace) poor, hungry, undereducated, and sickly because then we would be too weak and focused on mere survival to do anything about it; in this weakened state, we would make great cheap labor for it and all other manufacturers and industries that rely on fossil fuels for their plants and products (the auto industry having one of the largest symbiotic relationships with it).<br/><br/>All this begs one question, though.  Where do the CEO\u2019s of the oil/gas industry, all the puppet politicians, and all their families plan on living?  Do they have a space ship ready for blast off?  Do they have another inhabitable planet to escape to?  OR, does greed really run that deep?", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 2656206, "replies": [], "lft": 1112, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22poll.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3727096, "rgt": 1113, "userDisplayName": "David Underwood", "createDate": "1303532784", "userID": 53612425, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303533003", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Citrus heights, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303529403", "commentSequence": 462, "commentBody": "Out of all the complaints about President Obama I have read here, I can not recall any that actually offer a concrete suggestion for solving the nations economic problems; they all complain he has done nothing, that he needs to do something, but no one seems to be able to say exactly what needs to be done.<br/><br/>How do we bring back eight million good production jobs? What industries should be funded and why? Who is going to pay for this recovery. I too am disappointed with Mr. Obama's actions as president. I had hoped he would treat the Republicans like FDR did and make them pariahs. That is not his style. He just seems to believe he can get the cooperation of the \"Loyal opposition.\" But the opposition is not loyal, and I can not understand why he keeps trying his bipartisan agenda, it is not working, it will not work with those who do not want it to work.<br/><br/>I see a real lack of understanding about our economic system on these forums. There is a great deal of hostility to TARP and the Fed. It does not look like these critics have read any of the recent books published on the economic crisis and why those actions were taken. Not counting the books on the subject that tell tales of machinations by Wall Street banks as traders, there are a few that contain the facts of the crisis and why. For historical perspective read Liaquat Ahamed's \"The Lords of Finance.\" Then read Andrew Ross Sorkin's \"Too Big to Fail,\" Henry Paulson's \"On the Brink,\" and the Phil Angelides commission report \"Inquiry Into the Financial Crisis.\" <br/><br/>You will see just how close the country came to economic paralysis. Then read books such as \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" and you will see where the jobs went. Look at the hedge fund managers who want companies to fail. Look into the companies that have sent production overseas and how they have profited at the expense of the American consumer.<br/><br/>Even the most well educated economists have not been able to formulate a comprehensive economic recovery plan. We recently allowed a group of individuals to run the market as they saw fit, and were told they would self regulate in their own interest. Well they did, in many cases taking home millions of dollars a year in compensation, while they devised even more ways to separate the rest of us from our meager incomes. We are told by one faction that raising taxes on the wealthy will make them spend less and invest less, by rescinding a tax cut they got for political favors. That tax reduction was primarily in dividends and capital gains for those with incomes of more than $250K, not on their earned income. The congress is playing chicken with the budget, and to my despair, Mr. Obama has allowed them concessions heaving nothing to do with the budget, but are attacks on the environment, health care, and women's health.<br/><br/>These same Republicans had no qualms about funding the invasion and occupation of Iraq by selling $1 trillion in debt to China, but $500 million to NPR is suddenly seen as a wasteful expense. <br/><br/>So what if we did leave Afghanistan, stop helping Pakistan, and kept the money here? What would be done with it to fix the economy? True we have deteriorating roads and bridges, and that would put a few skilled construction people to work. High Speed Rail should be built, but the Republicans will fight that until the day they can not get gas for their taxpayer subsidized cars, and airline fees become so high that even they can not afford the fare.<br/><br/>But that would not bring the economy back. So instead of all the criticism of Mr. Obama, how about some real concrete ideas for economic recovery?", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 2657856, "replies": [], "lft": 150, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/world/middleeast/23syria.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3725832, "rgt": 151, "userDisplayName": "valwayne", "createDate": "1303509688", "userID": 56582161, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303533163", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Denver", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303529563", "commentSequence": 58, "commentBody": "When Obama launched his useless, endless, costly, unauthorized war against a nation that was no threat tothe U.S., Libya, while he was playing soccer in Brazil, he took 10 days to finally tell us he took us to war for humanitarian reasons to keep Gadhafi from killing innocent people.

US Postal industrialized the doping, implementing a team-wide, EPO-based doping program systematically designed to decimate the competition, rather than just to keep pace. Tyler Hamilton's book explains how the entire pro peloton was caught flat-footed in '99, having brought the equivalent of knives to the Postal's machine guns in the 1999-01 tours.

Part of my job with American Express was setting up the \"network\" you are referring to - the communication lines (pipe) between merchant and Amex. The capacity of data across those lines was not  what drove the fees at all.

Even with a dramatic shift to the center (which isn't happening), they will still be The Answer-lite, and any major shift by the Republicans will be matched by a much more progressive Democratic caucus.<br/><br/>This is fairly easy to understand in the parlance of modern politics: If someone tries to take your position, you go further away to a position that they find unacceptable, and party there. Capitulation is never met with Acquiescence to the other sides position, or even further. No. If the Republicans attempt to move Left, so do the Democrats.<br/><br/>And with that, looking at that distribution and taking anything over 11 points for Obama, that totals 179 electoral votes. Those states are essentially almost off the board for Republicans for a considerable amount of time, at least two to three cycles. Taking 11 &lt; x &lt; 6, which now are relatively safe for one to two cycles, that's 54 more votes, for 233. <br/><br/>Any calculus that comes out having the Dems having any less than this, for the next two elections, is questionable. This is a base level. This is what Republicans have to fight against. A margin of error that is so small as to force some kind of hand. Because from 6 &lt; x &lt; 2, there's another 52 votes, totaling 285, well over 270 to feel comfortable, without even considering OH or FL. You can bet Dems are also gonna spend a lot of time in NC.

Learning more about the dynamics of our home during my childhood has allowed me\u2014over time\u2014to forgive my Mother for some of her \u201cheavy-handed\u201d behavior and my Father for his infidelity (to the entire family).<br />My particular experiences have made me keenly aware of the verse\u2014\u201cThe sins of the father are visited upon the son.\u201d For those of us who have dealt with infidelity, as we come to understand the weakness and need of the family member who was disloyal, we stand a far better chance of bringing the cycle of pain generated by the disloyalty to an end; otherwise, the \u201csins of the father are visited\u201d and revisited upon other family members and friends. The disloyalty puts in place a cycle of distrust and dysfunction that can only be ended by forgiving the one who betrayed the family.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1273854, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/mumbai/78528/prakash/restaurant-detail.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3081535, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "", "createDate": "1269070043", "userID": 7547660, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1269070043", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "", "commentType": "userReview", "updateDate": "1269180798", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Excellent restaurant.

Iraq was a stable thriving safe nation for most of it's citizens ,very similar to the US and Europe ,the persons with special interest connections received favor ,exactly as inn the USA.

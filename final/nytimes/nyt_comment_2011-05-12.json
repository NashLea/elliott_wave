It would be refreshing for the Times to add something new to the debate: Consider investigating if Charter Schools are a wise use of our public education dollars. Investigate how the Department of Education guidelines for Special Education are effectively cutting services for special needs children while saying those services are being provided. Audit the financial decision-making of several schools (principals have 100% control of their budgets, and some principals have only been on the job a year or two) and see where the money actually goes. And finally, why not interview an older teacher, who yes, is getting paid some $60 or $70 thousand  dollars a year - still less than a sanitation worker - and ask them what they do for the kids. I think you'll find that there are idealists across the spectrum, old and young, and that those who aren't working could be gotten out if the administrators were doing their jobs. <br/><br/>I am in my 4th year of teaching. I am not as worried about losing my job now as I am about what would happen if I were to remain a teacher for 25 years only to be fired because a principal could hire two new teachers for the same price.

These micro-fees and usury interest payments fall heavily onto people who already have little or no access to capital. <br/><br/>When chastened even lightly the banks cry foul because the consumers can adopt some flimsy protection from overdrafts, etc.  What is not written about is that often those overdraft protections come with credit checks.  Not to mention that when one is poor and without access to capital in this society, if you need to feed the kids for two days before payday and the rest of your family suffers similar hardships, the only option is to overdraft a bank account or walk down to the local homeless shelter. That is a bit of a difficult journey for Americans who are not used to even seeing breadlines let alone standing in one with their kids.

Governor Kasich keeps repeating that he wants to lure businesses to Ohio (he has privatized Ohio's longstanding economic development department too), but what business would want to locate in a state that doesn't educate its kids?

The ads are based on the subject matter of each piece and its keywords, and are usually unintentionally hilarious.\r<br/><br/>For example, alongside this Gail Collins column lambasting abysmal teacher training-for-profit were ads for similar on-line universities where you can buy teaching credentials on the cheap -- and all behind the anonymous screen of your own cheap home computer. Of course, these classes will only attract the best and the brightest G.E.D. grads and probably a few rejects from Catholic seminaries and aspiring Boy Scout leaders. (For some reason, there was also an ad for a school purporting to help you get an \"intelligence degree\" if your career goal involves the CIA).\r<br/><br/>The deliberate dumbing down of America seems to be official Republican party policy, and the latest statistics indicate we don't have far to go before hitting rock bottom. According to recent tests administered by the Department of Education, more than half of eighth graders do not know the purpose of the Bill of Rights. Three-quarters of high school seniors could not name one power granted to Congress by the Constitution. Only 10 percent of the middle schoolers demonstrated knowledge of the checks and balances among the three branches of government.\r<br/><br/>But that is probably all according to Republican plan, which defines checks as those pieces of paper with dollar signs endorsable by them, and balances meaning Fair and Balanced Fox News coverage. An educated electorate is a clear and present danger to those who stay in power through sheer mendacity and whose concern for children is limited solely to the nine months they stay in the womb.\r<br/><br/><a href=\"http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com/\" title=\"http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://kmgarcia2000.blogspot.com/</a>", "recommendationCount": 446}, {"assetID": 2724622, "replies": [], "lft": 14, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/opinion/12collins.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3818248, "rgt": 15, "userDisplayName": "Marie Burns", "createDate": "1305167846", "userID": 4461145, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1305174847", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1305171247", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "The biggest problem with American education is all the legislators and so-called educators who were educated -- or not -- in America. When you have know-nothings in state legislatures and on school boards across the nation deciding the curricula, why be surprised when the kids come out knowing nothing? In Texas, members of the state school board want the kids to learn that Newt Gingrich and Phyllis Schlafly were great Americans, and Martin Luther King, Jr. was kind of a Black Panther who had the same goals as Alabama's segregationist Governor George Wallace. Sounds about right to me. And maybe this kind of \"education\" will be a big help to Newt, who we learned yesterday is running for president in a surprise video announcement he made that reminded me a lot of Christine O'Donnell's \"I An Not a Witch\" ad. Although he did not wear pearls.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Republican complaints about \"elite\" teachers who have cushy part-time jobs with summers off to loll around and do nothing are not helping, nor are Republican efforts -- a number of them successful -- to cripple teachers' unions. Probably the unionized teachers are among the rabble-rousers who think classroom internships are an essential element of teacher training.  <br/><br/>The move to for-profit education is appalling. One of the biggest proponents of for-profit education is Florida's former Governor Jeb Bush who runs a \"foundation\" which is largely funded, coincidentally I'm sure, by the very for-profit schools Jeb runs around the country promoting. In fact, the reason Jeb has given for not running for President is that he \"wants to make some money for his family.\" I guess promoting for-profit education is pretty lucrative. The President of the United States has a crummy salary of $400,000 a year, plus a $50,000 expense account. And when he quits his job, he and his wife can make millions in book deals and speaking engagements. That is so not enough for Jeb and his family.<br/><br/>I'm thinking if we are ever going to \"Win the Future,\" we had better import some of those experts from Finland, Australia and Japan who are running programs geared to teaching kids useful skills and accurate information, and to treating their teachers with dignity and fair compensation. We've had quite enough of American \"experts'\" input. In the last couple of decades these geniuses have moved American education from the best in the world to about 15th place. Thanks, but no thanks, Jeb.

Not surprisingly, major donors to the Republicans who support this legislation are companies that run on-line education programs.  Other legislation pending in Idaho would weaken collective bargaining rights of teachers and begin to implement \u201cperformance-based\u201d pay policies. <br/><br/>In Pennsylvania, Indiana, and 33 other states, reactionary Republican Governors and/or state legislators are pushing for school voucher programs that would allow a small number of students attend private schools on the taxpayer's dime.  Many of these Republicans are combining such proposals with attempts to massively cut funding for public education. <br/><br/>And at the national level, Republicans are seeking to restore a voucher program in DC while, unfortunately, the Obama Administration is pushing for expansions of charter schools. <br/><br/>The problem with all of this is that it is doing very little to actually help education our children.  Study after study have shown that charter schools perform no better than public schools.  While charter schools are a bit cheaper on a per student basis, that is largely because they have much lower proportions of ESL students, disabled students, and other students who have additional needs.  Vouchers, at best, allow only a few students, most of whom are relatively well-off, to attend private schools while taking away resources from public schools. <br/><br/>The simple fact is that the best way to improve education in America is to improve public education, as 90% of students attend public schools and other options have done no better despite strong support from politicians and rich philanthropists.  Instead of diverting our resources, let's increase funding for schools, reduce class size, pay teachers better, provide additional tutoring, and take the other steps needed to give all of our children a fair start. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a> ", "recommendationCount": 423}, {"assetID": 2724622, "replies": [], "lft": 20, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/opinion/12collins.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3818279, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "John Farrish", "createDate": "1305168271", "userID": 18907052, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1305174847", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Lafayette, LA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1305171247", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Let 'em eat cake.\r<br/><br/>That's the sentiment. At some point in the near future, when the forces of corporatism have their way, education will be a strictly private matter. The provision of educational services will be left to market forces, meaning, of course, that some will simply not be able to afford it, and those who can will be sending their money to private corporations to educate their kids. Charter schools, vouchers, the dismantling of student loan programs, are all meant to not only wrest control of the educational system from the public, but to eliminate public education altogether, in much the same way the drive to privatize Social Security is meant to spell its ultimate demise. \r<br/><br/>Why pay into Social Security when we can privatize it and private investment firms can make billions? Why pay for Medicare when Paul Ryan can simply turn over the tax dollars to private insurance companies?

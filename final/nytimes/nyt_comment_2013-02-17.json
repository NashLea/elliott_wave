Minimum wage is what one pays unskilled labor, including teenagers and less-skilled immigrants.

Raise the minimum age, and part time and summer jobs become more attractive to teens, while unskilled labor jobs are an attractor for immigration--illegal, and to a lesser extent legal immigration; for legal immigrants, the minimum wage is a guarantee that minimizes the financial risk of immigration.  It is amazing how many taxi drivers are skilled immigrants who have difficulty finding other jobs.  The current lack of minimum wage jobs has temporarily \"secured\" our southern border, but that will change as the economy improves.<br/>Now, there are situations in which raising the minimum wage would increase unemployment:  if there is no possibility for economic expansion, and where the low end of the economic scale is filled with unproductive workers that can be made more productive through fear of losing their jobs, for example.

No one can force you to make a claim for benefits.  Never make a claim for benefits &amp; you'll be guaranteed not to get any.  No gov't employee will come to stuff them into your pocket.<br/><br/>Better yet, you can also continue to buy extra insurance for as long as you like, if you can afford it.  Fortunately, the ACA now protects you from all those things your insurance company would surely do to you if ever you got \"too expensive.\"  Everything, that is, except jacking up the premiums to \"market rates.\"  <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you took advantage of Medicare and social security, all those insurance premiums you've been paying to those insurance scoundrels for 40 years could now be invested in the stock market.

It was so obvious Roberts, Alito, and Scalia were biased. They want to end affirmative action because \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" The clock is ticking for Roberts: no more of this nonsense; 12 years is enough, 25 is just unbearable. Alito and Scalia--both Italian-Americans, both considered ethnic minorities to this day but who by virtue of their skin color can transcend the \"definitive\" features of American whiteness--attempt to validate their identity by attacking a politically unpopular policy deemed unnecessary, if not sinful, by white people. And who can forget that lawyer who were it not for affirmative action would probably not be sitting on the bench today: Poor Justice Thomas; affirmative action traumatized him but sent him to Yale and ultimately the Supreme Court. Why have they shut their doors to a more balanced, intellectual, and fair legal inquiry on the subject? At least Kennedy is open to the idea of remanding the case to seek additional facts and perhaps come up with alternatives. Oh, speaking of alternatives, in Glosip v Gross, Roberts, Alito, and Scalia grilled the defense attorney for failing to name an alternative to Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. Why didn't they pressure university lawyers to do the same. No, instead they simply attacked. The irony of things: Sotomayor got so much grief for her Latina comment.

Every company I've worked at has been fairly diverse holistically, until you look at the front office, the people getting business who were ultimately the key to the company's success.  That area was usually 95% male, and white/asian.  Audit, accounting, technology, back office?  Diverse.<br/><br/>It's all very screwy and frustrating, and leads to stereotyping.  Every time people see someone from one of the privileged classes, you can tell there's a certain doubt - is this guy here because he deserves it?<br/><br/>I don't know if it's feasible (this stuff is all very complicated and I'm just an idiot on the internet) but I'd prefer it if there was more of a focus on developing equally qualified candidates, because promoting less qualified ones is very destabilizing.", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 3443438, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 16911829, "replies": [], "commentID": 16912151, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "TPierre Changstien", "createDate": "1449724924", "userID": 1456724, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1449757148", "userTitle": "NULL", "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Carol lee", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "bk,nyc", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1449757148", "commentSequence": 16912151, "commentBody": "I think what you're seeing is their reaction to the pernicious destructive nature of an explicitly race based society.

Scalia seems to want to follow the Trump pattern of saying more and more outrageous statements to get attention, and Roberts because of his apparent lack of understanding of what America should be about. Why should there be diverse people in Science classes? Because a big part of education is to be exposed to different ideas and people and to become more confident in the world. Because it would be useful that all American citizens have a good education in science. Perhaps the Justices have been picked from such rarified backgrounds and educations that they are unable to know what is really going on out there, and future appointments should be more diverse, I.e. Maybe from a law school from someplace other than the Eastern Seaboard?  Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton seem to be a good reason to avoid Harvard for awhile. It would be interesting to see the drop out rates from UT. I would suspect that there are a good number from the automatic admits. The supposition that any student that is admitted because of any affirmative action analysis would be an automatic failure is objectionable. I have seen many people come from small high schools, with no advanced courses, go on to be very successful in college and professional school. I am very tired of the classism, snobbishness and judgmental statements, such as that of Justice Scalia.

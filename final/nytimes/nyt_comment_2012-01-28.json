I guess he figures that his moon colony would be filled with Republicans (we can only hope!).<br/><br/>As for Romney, a loss in Florida is not needed to show that his candidacy is in question. Romney has always been the natural frontrunner in the race yet GOP voters have been extremely reluctant to coalesce around him. So reluctant, in fact, that they have flirted with Gingrich, Santorum, Perry, Bachmann, and Cain, each of whom should never be anywhere near the White House. <br/><br/>The problem for Romney is two fold. First, is his Mormonism, which consists of a different set of myths than those believed by the evangelicals that make up a large percentage of the GOP base. The gap between those two religious sects is so large that many evangelicals simply won't vote for Romney. <br/><br/>The second is that Romney's complete lack of any core convictions or beliefs worries many conservatives that Romney won't be with them on the key issues. I am far more concerned that his lack of convictions means that a President Romney wouldn't stand up to the crazies who have taken over the GOP. But if conservatives decide not to turn out for Romney in the general election, more power to them. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 295}, {"assetID": 3303023, "replies": [], "lft": 15, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/world/middleeast/violence-rises-sharply-in-syria-flustering-arab-league-monitors.html", "parentID": 5374563, "commentID": 5377120, "rgt": 16, "userDisplayName": "CityBumpkin", "createDate": "1327704106", "userID": 60909833, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1327727685", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Earth", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1327727685", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "You asked \"Why isn't the UN, the entire Arab world, all those liberal blowhards who condemn Israel every moment of their lives, standing up and stating enough is enough - this tinpot dictator who inherited his power from his ruthless father has got to be eliminated?\"<br/><br/>From the FIRST paragraph of the article:<br/><br/>\"Violence in Syria has escalated sharply in the past two days, with heavy bloodshed reported Friday in at least three flash points as Arab League monitors expressed exasperation and the United Nations Security Council prepared to discuss the crisis as a step toward a possible resolution condemning President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.\"<br/><br/>Also from the article:<br/><br/>\"At the Security Council on Friday, diplomats from Western and Arab nations were holding talks on a draft resolution that would condemn Mr. Assad\u2019s government, and there were expectations that a vote could be held next week. \"<br/><br/>If you google it, the King of Jordan has also called Assad to step down. <br/><br/>Next time you have an axe to grind about Israel, maybe you should actually read the article first.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 3303023, "replies": [], "lft": 60, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/world/middleeast/violence-rises-sharply-in-syria-flustering-arab-league-monitors.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5377141, "rgt": 61, "userDisplayName": "jstevend", "createDate": "1327704392", "userID": 25036455, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1327727685", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Mission Viejo, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1327727685", "commentSequence": 14, "commentBody": "It seems that this is something of a class war, the privileged under the Assad regime against the others, revolting now for some political power.

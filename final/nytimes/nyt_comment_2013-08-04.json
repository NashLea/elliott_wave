As far as sfd's comment, I don't see the term \"whites\" anywhere in bush hippy's comment just the term \"white man's game\", which it is, so you are assuming it.  He wrote \"haters\" and You are the one who is connecting the words \"whites\" and \"haters\".  One last point, I don't know where you are coming from (sfd), but racism is alive and well in this country."}]}, "lft": 50, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/sports/baseball/choosing-to-remember-rodriguez-as-an-18-year-old.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 9641860, "rgt": 55, "userDisplayName": "bush hippy", "createDate": "1375584724", "userID": 65898372, "replyCount": 2, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1375589380", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Mad River, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1375585780", "commentSequence": 20, "commentBody": "Like Tiger Woods, A Rod is an exceptionally gifted athlete.

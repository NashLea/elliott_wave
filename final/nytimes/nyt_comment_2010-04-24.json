Likewise, if someone had a good hand, play was cautious since it was likely everyone had a pretty good hand.<br /><br />That observation seems to apply to this situation. Apparently this is the round for Republican poor hands.<br /><br />A lot of it stems from the fact that primary elections are starting to take place while the public is still inflamed about their situation. Come November, however, the Democrats are going to have a credible list of accomplishments and about eighty percent of the employable American population will have much less anxiety about their employment.<br /><br />The Republican candidates, however, will have a much less substantial record of accomplishments, and through the camera lens, their supporters in the background may be a serious PR challenge.<br /><br />Both parties may have hopeless candidates but at least the Democrats are not trying to changes horses in mid-stream. The Republicans are trying to change horses in mid-stream - with inexperienced horses.<br /><br />If the Republicans don't do well, the Democrats had better work to work to better their hands the next time around because it's for certain the Republicans will.

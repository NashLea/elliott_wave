The latent heat of melting ice is still small relative to the enormous heat capacity of the oceans.  The ARGO float program is getting better data on the change in heat content of the oceans. There are a bunch of ARGO buoys that sample the ocean at different depths and send the data back to NOAA.  The program is still relatively new. The expected T changes in the ocean are quite small give its large heat capacity, so long observing times are clearly better than a few years.  Both the upper ocean (often take for this purpose to be above 700 m) and the deeper ocean (mean depth 3800 m) show signs of warming but as time goes on we will have better data.  So the \"missing hear\" could easily be n the oceans.  See for example von Schuckmann Jour Geophys Res 09 and both Meehl 2011  Nat Clim Change and Loeb Nat Geosci 2012 for useful studies.  They suggest continued heat uptake by the oceans and would not easily be reconciled with the new Norwegian study. Heating the ocean causes thermal expansion and sea level rise, so SL data should constrain the problem.  The difficulty is sorting out how much SL change is from ice melt and how much from expansion (steric) at the level of uncertainty necessary.

It identified a reported rate of \"reproductive coercion\" of 16% among men, and compared that to an earlier 2010 study that showed only 8.7% of men reported equivalent acts of women sabotaging birth control. The gist of the viral sharing was \"men try to control women by sabotaging birth control more than women do.\"<br/><br/>But this was misrepresentation.  When you break into the data, \"reproductive coercion\" isn't just birth-control sabotage, but also social pressuring women to have children.  On the screening questionnaire, women were also asked if their partner ever 'threatened' to end their relationship to seek a partner willing to have children.  This was counted equivalent to birth-control sabotage in the 16% headline number; when you reduce reproductive coercion to birth-control sabotage, the study showed an incident rate of 9.2%, within the margin of error of 8.7%.<br/><br/>Nevermind that \"men sabotage birth control more than women\" has become an untrue trope; consider the straightforward acceptance of the idea that men shouldn't say they may end a relationship because they want to have children while their current partner does not.

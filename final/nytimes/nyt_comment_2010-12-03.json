At least this time you got a glimpse of the obstreperous nature of Republican ideologues, and I hope you found it at least mildly irritating.  Ryan seems to enjoy lowering taxes, but to compensate for lowered revenues he also enjoys dismantling social services.  There is also his idea of a regressive consumption tax, so that lower and middle income people still wind up footing most of the bill.  The rich can shelter and hoard their money, while the less well off, who must consume every penny they own, wind up paying disproportionately more.  His vision focuses on the free market creating nebulous business opportunities, while he disparages (presumably with a sneer) the European model of taking care of people, most of whom  are beyond their entrepreneurial years, and are mostly concerned with finding food, shelter, and medical care.<br /><br />To reinforce this point you harp once again on \u201cshifting resources from unproductive consumption to more productive investment.\u201d  Of course as our population ages, our individual lives become less profitable, and people enter the phase of what you call \u201cunproductive consumption.\u201d  Apparently when granny can no longer work, you begrudge her the increasing cost of her upkeep.  You say as much when you advocate shifting money from the affluent elderly to struggling youth.  Of course one struggles in one\u2019s youth in order to build wealth and hopefully enjoy a more affluent old age.  I wonder if you ever have a vision in which you are no longer productive, and require a little of the support that most of us eventually need.

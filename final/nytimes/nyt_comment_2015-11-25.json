I am speaking a s a daily user of a schedule 2 opioid drug. That drug is hydrocodone. I use it daily as prescribed 4 times per day, to treat an incurable, and extremely painful neuromuscular illness. Since it was reclassified as a schedule 2 drug, I have experienced inconvenience, and abuse at the hands of those who seek to prevent this medication from falling into the wrong hands. This includes monthly doctor visits (as opposed to every three months) which my insurance company reimburses at a rate of $420 per month, thus inflating the cost of medical care by god-only knows how much. I'm told this is the most widely prescribed pain killer in the nation. Imagine what utterly draconian drug laws are doing to your health insurance premiums?!  All because of laws to prevent safe and legal prescriptions from being written. And you thought the HUMAN cost was unconscionable. The dollar cost is no small matter either.

For someone who is suppose to be an ally they did nothing to aid he coalition in Desert Storm. They have done nothing to aid in the war on terror and reports indicate that the Russian fighter barely entered into Turkish air space and that the Turkish response was clearly an overreaction on their part. To me that begs the question;  what is their end game? Were they trying to send a message? Were they trying to quell any doubts about their commitment to NATO? They are playing a very dangerous game. But by far the most horrific part of it was as the pilots parachuted the Turks shot and killed the 2 pilots as they descended to earth.  I think NATP should meet and expel Turkey. To kill 2 helpless pilots in this manner to me deserves expulsion and those responsible be tried for war crimes. <br/><br/>Finally, Putin has indicated that Russia will make a very strategic and bold response. I would bet that they will hit key infrastructure facilities as well as key military installations. And then how will Turkey respond and will  NATO support them.

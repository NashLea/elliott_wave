My husband worked 18 hour days and we sacrificed a lot to make it happen.  I felt  that they would receive a sub-standard education at our town HS when my son, struggling in his Honors Algebra course, was told by his teacher, \"I don't teach Algebra, I facilitate it.\"   He was secure in his abject laziness because he had the golden ticket of \"tenure\" in his pocket.  The younger, still enthusiastic teachers were the best, but they were the first ones to go if downsizing was required.  The private day school was  populated with teachers who allowed tangential discussions on course material, which encouraged intellectual curiosity.  Faculty comprised a core group of seasoned teachers and new college grads.  There was a good deal of staff turnover after a few years, as the now experienced teachers went on to pursue their higher education.   Salaries were paltry compared to those of public school teachers , yet the rate of graduation  was near 100 %.   All  students were not children of \"those rich, money- grubbing tax evaders\" that our divisive politicians hammer us about;  most parents used a \"payment plan\" , some kids had scholarships or need-based aid.  Both students and teachers had a long day, as after school sports or community service was a requirement.  Kids were \"ready to learn\", and the lack of  that in inner city schools is the #1 problem teachers face in K-3; kids with no food, sleep or stable homes.

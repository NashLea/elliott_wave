So when it comes to gender and the sexual marketplace, men are irrational but women are not.  I don't buy that.  From my experience, women still value men as partners primarily based upon their potential economic contribution to any future household.  Men with higher incomes are more desirable.  Therefore, men try to maximize their sexual desirability by maximizing their income.  When men meet women with equivalent or higher incomes, men are concerned that women might be less interested in them.<br/><br/>This is not men not adjusting to a new social role-- this is men reacting to the fact that men DO NOT HAVE a new social role.  While the feminist movement has given women many more choices in self-definition over the past 50 years, men have been stuck in the same box.  Change male social roles and you might find that men are not \"threatened\" by higher female income, and do in fact welcome it.  As women tend to write articles on gender and conduct gender research, this point is often missed-- \"gender\" discussions are typically lack a male perspective.

Besides rampant corruption with slap wrist punishments, if any, PT has proved itself to be thoroughly incompetent in managing the country. Brazil's growth during the last ten years was due to the sound economical and managerial principles established by presidents Franco and Cardoso, between 1992 and 2002. The Workers Party systematically voted against all the reforming legislation, which created the basis for Brazil's growth. Lula and Dilma Roussef just took advantage of the vast institutional reform and rode out the world's generalized growth wave while uttering socialist slogans and courting third world dictators. Regretfully,  Dilma Roussef will probably be reelected and Lula will still be pulling strings behind the scenes. Communism, which is extinct all over the world (North Korea and Cuba are located somewhere out of this planet) still has many sympathizers among Brazilians misguided, and this has to be taken into consideration when analyzing Brazilian politics.

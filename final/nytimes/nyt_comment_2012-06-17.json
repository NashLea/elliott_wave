There's something to this--increasing the supply of housing in New York would no doubt be helpful. But, apart from any issues of impact on neighborhoods (and subways), Glaeser's idea has an important flaw.<br/>\nHighrises are expensive to build. The taller they are the more expensive they are on a per square foot basis. So when a highrise is added to the city's housing stock, it's not the same as adding, say, a 6 story apartment building, where each unit is cheaper. That highrise can only be economically justified by the developer if he can sell it for more than its cost--if he can't he simply won't build it.<br/>\nAnother problem is \"filtration.\" Economists assume that if you build new housing, older units will filter down to poorer people, eventually to the true poor. But that only works if new entrants don't come in and grab up the units. In New York and other highly desirable cities they will. Corporations will use the unit for occasional housing. Suburbanites who've wanted to move back to the city will do so. Well and good, but it doesn't create any new housing for existing New Yorkers. In San Francisco, some new downtown highrises only have a minority of permanent residents.<br/>\nI'm all for more housing supply in cities, but creating affordable housing is not as simple as an economist's two line graph.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3326174, "replies": [], "lft": 53, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/us/for-many-immigrants-obamas-policy-offers-relief.html", "parentID": 6436640, "commentID": 6437083, "rgt": 54, "userDisplayName": "Janet", "createDate": "1339907839", "userID": 14480101, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1339907896", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1339904297", "commentSequence": 11, "commentBody": "Yes, he is doing everything within his powers as President to get something done in this country, given the refusal of Congress to act.

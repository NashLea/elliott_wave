Lowering labor cost is just one way to maximize profits, but it can pay off big for a company when it wins a concession. Recent anti-trade union behavior of some state governments following Republican routs in blue territory is illustrative of this mindset.  They went to labor to balance their books after decades of government waste and deal making.  That the middle class is evaporating is of little consequence to the corporation, collateral damage.<br/><br/>They have replaced men with robots, and moved jobs offshore.

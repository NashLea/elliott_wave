In her first tournament back, the Australian, this was something I saw as a glaring problem that she needed to work on in order to make a strong comeback. As the stats prove, Stoser's 70% winning percentage on second serves made quite a difference. Once Henin gets her first serve consistent and stops making so many uncharacteristic unforced groundstroke errors she should be back to her old self. Her lack of backhand winners wasn't a good sign either. Stoser seems to have quite alot of talent with the big serve and forehand and can go far on the tour.

I may have made mistakes, so feel free to check this yourself:<br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam_Men's_Singles_champions\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam_Men's_Singles_champions</a><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam_Boys'_Singles_champions\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam_Boys'_Singles_champions</a><br /><br />This minor amateur analysis should be read with caution, especially if you're a young tennis player. For one thing, singles isn't everything. For another, slams aren't everything.<br /><br />Of the 106 boys who've won junior singles slam titles since 1980, just 5 went on to win a senior title - Roddick (junior Oz 2000, jUS 00), Fed (jWim 98), Pat Cash (jWim 82), Mats Wilander (jFrench 81), and Stefan Edberg (the only person to win a junior Grand Slam, which he did in 1983).<br /><br />Btw, all five men won senior titles within five years of their junior title, which is unwelcome news for a certain Scottish gent (jUS 04) and Gael Monfils (jOz 04, jFrench 04, jWim o4).<br /><br />Of the boys who've won junior Slams since 1990, I count just 9 who have reached a senior Slam final so far - Fed, Andy R, Andy M, El Mago (Coria), Tsonga, Baghdatis, Gonzo, Nalbandian, and R\u00edos. Admittedly, one of their primary sins was to be born in the age of Fed &amp; Rafa.<br /><br />Speaking of Rafa, he never won a junior Slam - I think he only entered two junior tournaments, reaching the junior Wimbledon semis in 2002. He was knocked out by Lamine Ouahab, who went on to lose to Todd Reid in the final. Incidentally, in the girls final that year, one Maria Sharapova - who won the senior title two years later - lost to Vera Douchevina. Kim's little sister Elke (now retired due to injuries) was part of the junior doubles winning team that year (Barbora Strycova was her partner).<br /><a href=\"http://www.clgandjrtennis.com/Wimbledon02.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.clgandjrtennis.com...</a><br /><br />Of the 28 men who have won senior Slams since 1990, only 4 won junior Slams: Ivan Lendl (jFr 78, jWim 78), Edberg, Roddick, Fed.<br /><br />In other words, 24 men who won senior Slams since 1990 did NOT do so at junior level: G\u00f3mez, Sampras, Becker, Courier, Stich, Agassi, Bruguera, Muster, Kafelnikov, Krajicek, Kuerten, Rafter, Korda, Moy\u00e1, Safin, Ivani\u0161evi\u0107, Hewitt, Johansson, Costa, Ferrero, El Gato (Gaudio), Nadal, Djoker, El Lobo (delpo).<br /><br />For the women (I was too tired to repeat the whole process) : Venus, Serena, Kim, Maria, Kuzy, Pierce, Steffi, Arantxa, Monica, Majoli, Novotn\u00e1, Ivanovi\u0107, Myskina have no junior singles slams, but Justine, Mauresmo, Capriati, Hingis, and Davenport do.<br /><br />Winning singles Slams isn't everything - what matters for young tennis players is enjoying the game and making a living from it. (And as a doubles fan, I'd also add playing doubles.) Any kid who reaches a Slam final and thinks \"Oh no, I'm gonna jinx myself if I win this!\" is a twit.

Watch \"Roman Holiday\" with Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn and a very young Eddie Albert before you go.<br />2.  Go to Trastevere at least one night for the evening Passeggiata; it happens around the Piazza of the Church of Santa Maria (which also shouldn't be missed for the mosaics).<br />3.  When the hot and crowded of the Old City starts to weigh, spend a couple hours biking on the splendid countryside of the Appian Way.  (Metro to Colli Albani, bus #660 to end of the line.  Bike rentals right at the stop at a nice outdoor cafe).<br />4. Some evening, walk or take the bus up to the Giancolo, the highest park in Rome with beautiful views over Old City and back to St. Peters.

You call for an \"expanded form of understanding that includes the mental but that is still scientific.\" After talking about the limits of the traditional scientific worldview, it is unclear why you want to hang onto this term. In the face of scientific reductionism you seems to want a scientific maximalism, where just the right extra bit could be added to the scientific paradigm to capture subjective consciousness. <br/><br/>This approach seems similar to the zombie universe example: imagine an atom by atom copy of our universe, but one in which the people were zombies rather than conscious beings. What, exactly, is missing between the two universes? Now the thought exercise is: imagine a version of science that is an exact copy of our existing science, but one that is able to fully describe the experience of being conscious.

Second, one employee in a daycare center, even as many don't have health insurance, cost a legitimate employer rather more than what they pay the employee.  If the employee costs the employer $16/hr. to pay for (her wage + employer expenses paid to the gov't), at 40 hrs/wk x 4 wks. x 12 mos. = $30,720.  Say the operator has 4 employees, all costing $30,720/yr.; ttl cost for employees is $122,880.<br/><br/>So, at any one time, the center has 20 kids in it.  If the parent(s) are charged $20,000/yr. ttl for each kid, gross revenue for the center is $400,000.  400-122 leaves $278k.  Probably, 20 kids means there's a location: a building of some kind.  Rent will vary from location to location, but 20 kids probably need about 1500 sq ft at least, right?  Say then it costs in rent or mortgage about $1,100/mo.  So now it's another $13,200 on top of it for expenses.  Down to $264k.  Add monthly charges like electricity and water: possibly another $15,000+ total.

If you aggregate the expected yield from various investments over different time intervals you get the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital.  In a liquidity trap, the short-term real rate is too high to induce full employment-restoring investments except those with a very short time horizon, where competition is not an issue.  The long-term rate is basically boot-strapped from the short-term rate and is too high for the marginal efficiency to be positive considering competition in the long-run.<br/><br/>The monetary authority can only induce long-term investments, if it can credibly lower the long-run rate such that it falls below the expected long-run aggregate marginal efficiency of capital.  In practical terms, this means the Fed quantitatively swaps long-range debt for short-term liquidity and the banks, in turn, swap liquidity for long-term assets including bonds and loans.

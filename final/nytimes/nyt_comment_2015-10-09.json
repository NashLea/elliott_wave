The issue is fraud committed by Volkswagen against the government, its consumers, and even its shareholders, and who was responsible.   But a second issue is, how to best mitigate the excess nitrogen oxide?<br/><br/>The most difficult cars to retrofit to bring into compliance will be the first generation cars without Selective Catalytic Reduction.   Those cars will need to have that equipment retrofitted to the cars to come into compliance.  An expensive prospect.<br/><br/>I suspect that the amount of excess nitrogen oxides these cars produce is small compared to the nitrogen oxide produced at a one or two old coal fired midwestern power plants.   If Volkswagen were to buy a couple of these old power plants, shut them down, and replace the electricity with clean power produced by wind and solar, the TDi pollution would be offset.    And the cars could be left, unmodified, to live out their remaining useful lives before they ultimately go to the crusher.   <br/><br/>Emissions trading is an accepted part of any cap and trade regime.

But the McGovernites (the New Left) of the 1960s took over the Democratis.  They were nearly as anti-government as the Republicans.   They were the big de-regulators, and then Obama simply reappointed the failed Bob Rubin team who are following the same low tax policy (three points on the top 2%!!!), fake regulation (read Sheila Bair's Down in the Dumps), and doctrinnaire free trade.   Indeed, the Rubin crew is following a  QE3-zero interest policy to force investors to take new risks with their retirement in a bond and maybe stock bubble.<br/><br/>The Republicans are moving rapidly to the left to appeal to their New Deal base    A team of, say, Jeb Bush and Sheila Bair as VP, would wipe out Hillary from 25 years in the past and the Rubin team.   At least the Republicans know they have to move to the center.    New Democrats like Krugman have no suspicion that they must abandon the 1960s as well and what faces them.   They just keep appealing to the wealthy suburbs as their \"left-wing base\" and Obama is quite likely going for European austerity.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3351780, "replies": {"comments": [{"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7850012, "replies": [], "commentID": 7850925, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Rob Porter", "createDate": "1355487409", "userID": 27349913, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1355504212", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 2, "editorsSelection": true, "parentUserDisplayName": "Bill Appledorf", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "PA", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1355504212", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "Also:<br/>\nCut 1/3 of military budget<br/>\nStop the drug war<br/>\nCap deductions to $25k<br/>\nTax all capital gains as ordinary income<br/>\nMake the top marginal rate 39%<br/>\nAnd we're there<br/>\nRob P<br/>\n<a href=\"http://cfdemsblog.com\" title=\"http://cfdemsblog.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://cfdemsblog.com</a>"}, {"recommendedFlag": 0, "parentID": 7850012, "replies": [], "commentID": 7851519, "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Dennis M", "createDate": "1355492963", "userID": 66746167, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1355504395", "userTitle": null, "recommendations": 0, "editorsSelection": false, "parentUserDisplayName": "Bill Appledorf", "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Margaretville NY", "depth": 1, "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1355504395", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "Good work..that is basically the same list I announced a couple of weeks ago in my weekly radio commentary on our local community radio station.

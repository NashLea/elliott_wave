Older americans collecting social security and medicare are the strongest supporters of the republican party. The party would be crazy to do anything but strengthen and maintain these earned entitlements and you can be quite sure that they know their duty. As far as I can see the only difference between the parties is on the basic philosophy of the entitlement programs. Republicans, abhor the thought of being forced to live off charity in their old age. They are too proud and jealous of their independence and freedom and they would rather starve. They therefore only want what they have earned by the sweat of their brow. A dime more is charity, and a dime less is robbery.  Republicans thus insist that Social security and Medicare should be structured along the lines of a real private retirement insurance program. One that is based on a trust fund built up from dedicated payments taken from each paycheck for thirty or forty years and then saved and invested till needed. Democrats, being american, used to agree with this basic approach.Lately however they seem to be getting squishy on the idea that entitlements are earned benefits. They keep weakening the walls between these entitlement programs and the general budget and they keep trying to introducing means testing into the benefit a person gets.

But hopefully it offers insights into the interplay of rising food prices, weather disruptions and why the usual suspects go wild. We overlook in our search for truth that stories have an older half-life, greater social power, and have historically eclipsed the truth. Truth once was directly observed; market goods were stacked.<br />Stories embellished and altered for our entertainment what we all knew was the truth underneath.<br /><br />In a society of 300 million, that underlying truth is hard to find. So we substitute our personal untethered versions. But our need for mindless entertainment has exploded. Last week I read many posts of the Krugman ancillary entertainment industry, the legions of columnists, blogs, comments, and web sites whose raison d'etre is to strike at Paul Krugman not through examining his conclusions or invalidating his reasoning, but by saying \u201che's wrong because we all know he is wrong (wink or stare or angry scrawl) and this example and interpretation proves unequivocally in its fallacy he is unhappy, washed up, over the hill, failed, Keynesian\u201d and in Paul's words, \u201cevil.\u201d<br /><br />Of course, I disagree. But it was eye opening to read the sheer volume of vitriol and fantasy that a single person could generate. Especially one who currently holds no public position in government, works in a classroom and writes for the paper we are reading. The stories outsize his influence on government and policy. So while Paul speaks truth (mostly! we disagree on China's errancy and his framing of cultural issues as moral), he has greater value as a invention, as a story, as a means of entertaining the fears and jeers of many, as a target for the public illogic that deflates our fair pride and devalues the important nuances of civil duty. His hard truths make him an easy target. So Paul is a straw man inflated for those whose political appetites include a hearty enjoyment for bread and circuses.<br /><br />Paul's metrics show our dominant passion is fear. Paul's bokors with their deadening brew sanitize his examples, and smash the supporting detail, model building, and weighing of pros and cons, timeline comparisons and crafted logic that are the character of his posts. The wrong impuned is not a simple omission; it is framed as dangerous and leading to a perilous slide. This cultural formula undergrids the policy battles. But how can there be honest debate, if no view is thought sincere? And all differences are met with scorn?<br /><br />No matter the economic state, rising or falling, until we recognize and learn from our history, we are condemned to restore the old insanity. If we continue to allow the pursuit of power through money and deceit, our comfort will come from the wrong means and will bring about bad ends. Right now, we would do well to remember the unexpected dangers and delusions that lay in freedom.<br />--Walter Rhett<br /><a href=\"http://twitter.com/walterrhett\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/walterrhett</a>", "recommendationCount": 164}, {"assetID": 2382661, "replies": [], "lft": 18, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/opinion/07krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3346811, "rgt": 19, "userDisplayName": "Frunobulax", "createDate": "1297053039", "userID": 50176648, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1297056300", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1297056300", "commentSequence": 5, "commentBody": "I think this is about right.

The Supreme Court reversed that finding in 2007, leaving it to the Obama Administration\u2019s U.S. EPA to decide whether CO2 emissions endanger public health and welfare.  In April 2009, U.S. EPA made such an \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d which paved the way for regulation of CO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act.<br /><br />The first two sets of U.S. EPA CO2 regulations went into effect earlier this year. They are:<br /><br />* Automobile standards \u2013 Requires fleet-wide reductions in CO2 emissions from cars and light trucks.  These reductions translate into increased fuel efficiency standards rising from 30.1 miles per gallon (\u201cmpg\u201d) for cars and trucks for model year 2012 to 35.5mpg for model year 2016.<br /><br />* New Power Plants and Other Industrial Sources - Requires proposed new power plants or industrial sources to use best available control technology to reduce CO2 emissions.  Examples of how to reduce CO2 emissions include increasing plant efficiency, use of lower-CO2 fuels like natural gas or biomass, carbon capture and sequestration, and implementing combined heat and power projects that use the heat created by industrial process to generate electricity, or the excess hot steam created in power plants for certain industrial purposes.<br /><br />In addition, U.S. EPA is pushing ahead with its plans to develop specific CO2 emission performance standards for power plants and industrial sources over the next couple of years.<br /><br />While these EPA regulations are far from enough to fully address climate change, they are an important start that will provide a foundation upon which to achieve further reductions in CO2 emissions.  In addition, by starting to regulate CO2 emissions, we create more momentum in favor of transitioning to the use of cleaner, lower-CO2 energy sources.<br /><br />Unfortunately, EPA\u2019s regulatory authority is already under attack from Republicans and some Democrats in coal-dependent states, with the incoming Republican chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) calling for at least a two-year delay in any EPA CO2 regulations.  So, now is the time to call the White House and urge the Obama Administration to ocmmit to veto any legislation that would curb EPA's authority to regulate CO2, and to call your Congressmembers and urge them to allow EPA to do its job.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 518}, {"assetID": 2382661, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/opinion/07krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3346821, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "B.

A recent liberal blogger at the Guardian noted that when his columns and postings touched on concerns of large corporations, like Petroleum and Coal's interest in denying global climate change, because of the effect such claims might have on their bottom line, the number of vapid vitriolic rightist comments surged. He then traced it back to some publicist firm working on behalf of some corporations.<br /><br />The links is here: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/dec/13/astroturf-libertarians-internet-democracy\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.guardian.co.uk...</a><br /><br />And as you pointed out after the shootings in Tucson, these people can't win the debate on the merits. They will either post unsubstantiated claims which are not based on probable theory or fact, or they will try to shout down the debate or debase their opponent in the debate, which is you and/or the medium that is publishing your work.<br /><br />This is a disservice to the public's interest of course. But it also affects real lives. There's a shortage of food, riots develop, people die as a result. Ironically, the corporate friendly dictator might get thrown out of power because of the global warming that the corporation is trying to deny exists.  Strange world.<br /><br />So here you are commenting on global warming, something near and dear to the heart of some very wealthy and powerful corporations, so I would expect an onslaught of counter commentary, all of it paid for by corporations wanting to look AstroTurfish.<br />", "recommendationCount": 709}, {"assetID": 2382661, "replies": [], "lft": 28, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/opinion/07krugman.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3346829, "rgt": 29, "userDisplayName": "Karen Garcia", "createDate": "1297053358", "userID": 48110597, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1297056613", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New Paltz, NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1297056613", "commentSequence": 9, "commentBody": "When nearly half of all Egyptians subsist on $2 a day and nearly $1 of that goes toward food, it's understandable that they want some change to believe in. Their dictator Mubarak, who reportedly has billions stashed in Swiss banks, is a 21st century version of Louis XVI. He feasts, the masses starve, the masses revolt.<br /><br />It's a worldwide replay of the Old Testament plagues of Egypt - drought, record floods, heat and looming famine. Although climate change, both man-made and natural, are likely causes of both the crop failures and ensuing food shortages, the rising prices are also attributable to greed and an unregulated market.<br /><br />In the United States, the cost of groceries went up about four percent last year, with another four percent increase in 2011. According to the public interest group Farm Policy Facts, the increases in the recent past were blamed by AgriBusiness on the hike in petroleum prices, for which an adequate explanation was never given. Remember gas prices going down as mysteriously as they'd gone up? But food prices stayed high, because we'd gotten used to paying them. The Grocery Manufacturers Association spends millions of dollars in public misinformation campaigns that blame farmers and ethanol products for the continuing high price of a box of cereal. The food industry has no reason to lower prices at the register. They're \"sticky prices,\" the rationale being that companies don't have the incentive to lower prices once they're slapped on a product.<br /><br />With the massive crop failures and increasing Chinese demand, American food companies will have no compunction about raising our food prices even higher than anticipated. Then, if by some miracle, the weather improves in a year or two, we'll still be paying through the nose. That's the American way, or more accurately, the multi-national way.<br /><br />Maybe when we start having to pay half our incomes on food, and Republicans are successful in destroying the New Deal safety net, Americans will revolt too. Hungry people are angry people.

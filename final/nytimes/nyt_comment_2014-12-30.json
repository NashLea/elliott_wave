Notice that if you consider a sum and a sum 2 steps away, you are adding almost the same group of four except one old member is lost and one new member is gained. Furthermore, those two members are adjacent. Now if you hop around the star in steps of two you will land on all nine points before repeating. So the successive pairwise differences in the 9 numbers of a solution, accumulated one by one, must step uniquely through a range of nine consecutive integers. It's like telling someone on a ladder to step up 1 rung, up 2, up 5, down 1, down 5, etc., such that he steps once on nine adjacent rungs.

I wanted to use my imac to convert but I figured it will not be up to the task.  I have looked into several analog to dv converters such as elgato, canopus (now grassvalley), and datavideo dac 200.  These all cost about 200 if you can find them used on Amazon.  I tried to use one of the cheaper alternatives but found there are software issues unlike with the ones I listed above which just allow you to convert just using imovie or movie maker and no other unnecessary software.

It just adds another source.  How we read it and what we challenge will partly depend on our own study of history.<br /><br />The pioneering historian Ranajit Guha, in his article \"Chandra's Death\" takes a moment to reflect on \"the small drama and fine detail of social existence\" before using such detail to plunge ahead into a critical investigation of a murder of an ordinary woman in nineteenth century rural Bengal.  Reading between and beyond court documents he finds what the court, mired as it was in the same patriarchy that resulted in the death, could not see.  The woman who was found guilty at the time would never know that more than 100 years later, history cleared her name.<br /><br />While twitter too records \"the small drama and fine detail of social existence,\" it will take more than search engines to use this information to understand society or interpret history.  It will require critical rigour, compassion, insight and \"bending closer to the ground in order to pick up the traces,\" as Ranajit Guha has done to expose the systematic patriarchy that led to the death of one woman and the conviction of another woman for a crime committed by neither.<br /><br />In closing, allow me to quote Ranajit Guha:<br /><br />\"The ordinary apparatus of historiography has little help to offer us here.  Designed for big events and institutions, it is most at ease when made to operate on those larger phenomena which visibly stick out of the debris of the past.  As a result, historical scholarship has developed, through recursive practice, a tradition that tends to ignore the small drama and fine detail of social existence, especially at its lower depths.  A critical historiography can make up for this lacuna by bending closer to the ground in order to pick up the traces of a subaltern life in its passage through time.\"<br /><br />from \"Chandra's Death\" in Subaltern Studies V, Writings on South Asian History and Society<br />Edited by Ranajit Guha<br />Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987.<br />p. 138<br /><br />(I hope that the comments on the New York Times are being archived as well.)", "recommendationCount": 18}, {"assetID": 1366144, "replies": [], "lft": 22, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/technology/personaltech/15pogue.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1852162, "rgt": 23, "userDisplayName": "sgmorr", "createDate": "1271301751", "userID": 6353878, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1271304428", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Texas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1271300828", "commentSequence": 8, "commentBody": "A Popular Mechanics article of a few years ago referred to the phenomenon of the Digital Ice Age for the relentless obsolescence of media and formats over time.<br /><br />That's kind of hilarious that David got that call from Steve Jobs.

Sanctions by the US alone will have little to no effect and they certainly won't be crippling.  To deal with Iran we need to get a broad coalition on board.  To me even the limited progress with China during the summit was a major advance on this front.  We need to convince China and Russia that a radical Iranian government with nukes is a threat to them and to their interests.<br /><br />So Congress wants to help.  Great.  But why send a public letter urging unilateral sanctions that won't be very effective?  Make the point in private (as if the President didn't know this already).  Let the administration work to build a coalition.  It takes time but we've made progress.  At the best this public letter doesn't do anything to negotiations with other countries but more likely it makes it more difficult for the administration to build a coalition (who wants to work with someone who already has decided what the end product must be, we may already know that, but lets not make it public).<br /><br />So what does the letter do?  It pins the administration in a corner.  If it sensibly tries to build a coalition before taken action it is weak on Iran in our political discourse yet if it goes hawkish we end up with ineffective sanctions.  But it is great for Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike.

Estimates of the TEA Party event with Sarah Palin range from 10,000 to 16,000.<br /><br />I was there at the Common this morning.  On this very lovely spring day (not winter) the crowd was about 4,000, and about a third of it was there for curiosity or counter-protest.  (Those opposed and supporting the Tea Party were intermingled; except for right near the podium, there was no clear gathering of people which only represented one view.)<br /><br />The PA system was so terrible that only the few hundred closest to the speakers could hear.  Thus it was an event tailored for TV and radio.  The media cameras were all on the podium and I saw no cameras from the local news stations filming members of the crowd.  While arguments took place between opposing attendees, it was pretty civilized, although the pro-Palins had very few facts at their command, mostly just insults.", "recommendationCount": 5}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

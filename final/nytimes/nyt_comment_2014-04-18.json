We need very little of today's energy to heat heat, light, and power our lives.Over my lifetime I have seen technology thwarted because it hindered economic growth. Gulf Canada square in Calgary built 1979 20 story office tower  turns on the heat at minus 25 degrees C. and requires only its outdoor fountain to cool in summer.<br/>Our economy is enslaved by fossil fuel reliance. Without fossil fuel dependency our economy shrinks.<br/>It is much more than economic growth that is imperiled by a shift from fossil fuels it is an understanding that our economic system is a relic of a bygone era. Technology has the ability to provide each and everyone of us enough of everything we need but our economic model fails miserably in giving us mechanisms to distribute the goods and services. We are no farther ahead than 19th century Ireland where 1 million Irish peasants perished and millions of others suffered grievously while Ireland exported its food far and wide.<br/>As an economist Dr Krugman is right on the money when stating the elimination of our fossil fuels will not affect our economy.

Since the amount of energy 'stored' in fossil fuels is very large, It requires an insanely large land area to generate serious electrical energy to compete with coal or other fossil fuel.

Since sun is out only during day, we need to double it as the fossil fuels can produce energy day and night .... so that is 12 square meters. Also sun is not really bright during mornings and nights so let us make it 15 square meters.

If corporations were people, then no corporation could own another, and all holding companies, subsidiaries, etc. would have to be dissolved immediately (as per anti-slavery laws).<br/><br/>A corporation is nothing more than an absentee ownership arrangement which protects the owners (shareholders) from any legal liability, instead handing that liability off to the corporation's management (insiders) and assets.<br/><br/>The notion that such a legal fiction could be defined as a 'person' entitled to spend as much money as it wanted on buying politicians is beyond ludicrous, and shows that the Supreme Court has abandoned rationality and respect for the impartial rule of law in favor of political partisanship.  <br/><br/>Clearly, allowing corporate entities (say, the the British East India Company) to buy elections is not what the framers of the Constitution had in mind.

What a stretch of the imagination! What you're really describing here are not metaphors but idiomatic figures of speech, some of them anthropomorphic. We do not use these idioms, as you suggest, in an \"imprecise\" way or as a means to \"distance\" ourselves from our subjects. They are simply common ways of expressing common phenomena. At some point, what may once have been a novel metaphor simply becomes a synonym for a common word. <br/><br/>Everyone will know what I mean when I say your thesis on metaphors is \"half-baked,\" and NO ONE will think of cakes taken from the oven too soon. In fact, if I took my cake from the oven too soon &amp; it fell, I would not describe it as \"half-baked,\" because \"half-baked\" no longer refers to the state of a cake or a pie or a chicken.<br/><br/>When we describe a stock market \"dip,\" everyone knows exactly what we're talking about. There's no psychological distance between \"dip\" and \"down,\" other than that they are different parts of speech. Indeed, \"dip\" is more descriptive than \"down.\" \"Dip\" evokes a mental picture of a graph, whereas \"down\" is a more general term &amp; can describe a direction of various types of descents. <br/><br/>What you are describing is not poetry at all.

A situation that boggles the mind on so many different levels.<br /><br />The forces that cause the perpetuation of the status quo in Korea have two pegs: Geo-Political (intra Korea) and Domestic (inter-Korea).<br /><br />The GeoPolitical question is quite easily resolved: diplomatic neutrality. The issue is the strategic importance of the Korean Pennisula vis-a-vis Korea's much larger neighbors. Between Japan and China it is said, whomever dominates the peninsula holds a gun to the head of the other. Indeed, Korea has been invaded by Japan several times on its way to attacking China, much to Korea's regret, and at least one attack upon Japan originated in Korea. The obvious solution is for a unified Korea to be a diplomatic neutral, say the switzerland of North East Asia.<br /><br />The inter-Korea issue is a bit more complicated, but in essence, the most obvious way to solve that is to offer Kim, his retainers and confederates, the feudal deal.<br /><br />Basically, the ancestors, either literally or institutionally, of all Royalty, in almost all nations goes back to some war lord, not that much different than Kim, who arrived at that position through coercive, usually cruel and evil, means.<br /><br />Coercive force is expensive to wield, so once in power, the prudent war lord then seeks non-coercive means to hang on to his position.  Ultimately, the war lord exchanges much, then later most, power for legitimacy/moral authority while retaining, or gaining enhanced, prestige and wealth: Voila, a constitutional monarchy.<br /><br />That's the way it's always been and likely always will be.  The alternative is revolution.  The choice has always been: The King of England or Japan versus the King of France or Czar of Russia. It's called the Feudal Deal.<br /><br />Getting from here to there would be the complicated part. One way would be to divide the North in two: 1/4 to Kim in Pyeongyang (Principality of Pyonyang?) where he and his retainers continue as they do now and 3/4 to a new \"Kingdom of Chosen\" which he would retain \"constitutional monarchy\" sovereignty, while South Korean Bureaucrats would rule over it to do to the North's (Kingdom of Chosen's) economy what it did to the South's and phasing in democratic rule and Northerners into their own bureaucracy over time.  The Kim regime, resting easy in Pyonyang would get the same percentage of take from Chosen that they take now, plus a smaller percentage of the new growth - giving Kim an incentive to letting go. If it helps, throw in the title Emperor of Pyongyang and Emperor of Chosen. Knock yourself out, Kim.<br /><br />In 15 years, give or take 5 years, a customs union could be formed between the north and the south and a few years after that a Community similar to Europe's.  Hold out the carrot that some future Kim, if well behaved, could become all of Korea's ruling monarch.  Then, kick the can down the road and see where things go.<br /><br />Anyway, the way out of the current situation is diplomatic neutrality and a feudal deal.  Its not attractive, Kim's are an awful rougime, but it is better than watching millions of people suffer.<br />", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 1542670, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/opinion/10kristof.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2105160, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "jrfromdallas", "createDate": "1276139340", "userID": 57217193, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1276142567", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "dallas", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1276138967", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "I think if Obama played a little less golf and stayed away from giving commencement addresses he would find that time you are eluding to to actually do Presidential things like meet foreign leaders and deal with domestic issues.

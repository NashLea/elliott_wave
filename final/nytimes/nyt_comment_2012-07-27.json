And while I don't dispute that there are some progressives who want to ban guns, the vast majority of us do not seek to do so.  <br/><br/>Instead, I would venture that most progressives think that additional steps need to be taken to reduce the \"dangers posed by allowing the reckless and the careless to own and carry weapons.\"  We believe that mandatory background checks, closing the gun show loophole, banning cop-killer bullets and bullet clips that hold 100 shells, making it easier for police to trace guns that are used in a crime and to revoke the licenses of corrupt gun dealers, and making sure people on the terrorist watch list cannot buy guns are all common sense steps to protect public safety while not infringing on the right to own a gun that the Supreme Court found in the 2nd Amendment.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, such commonsense regulation is stymied by the NRA, which refuses to accept that with rights come responsibilities. As such, the NRA prevents action to protect public safety, while at the same time falsely accusing even the mildest supporters of common sense gun control of being out to take away everyone's guns. <br/><br/>In short, guns aren't the problem - the NRA is the problem.

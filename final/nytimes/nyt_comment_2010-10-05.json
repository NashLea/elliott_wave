Half the Republican's running for election to Senate seats were elected by the \"Tea Party.\" These Republicans are far to the right of where the Republican Party was 10 years ago.<br /><br />Ron Paul ran in the Republican Primary in 2008, as a Libertarian.<br /><br />Pretty much as a third party candidate you need major name recognition and/or a lot of money. Bloomberg is not the type who would run in a \"symbolic race\" which it obviously would be for him in 2012, even more so if the economy turned around, or Obama otherwise had an approval rating of at least the mid-50's (55%+). Bloomberg wouldn't enter such a race.<br /><br />The larger issue is whether the GOP will become a divided party. If Obama turns the country around, and pushes his approval rating to around 60%, the \"Tea Party\" will still elect the GOP-nominee. In almost every state the Republican Nominee is picked solely by Republican voters as Independents can't vote in the Republican Primary. Since 2008, so many moderate Republicans have become Independents (or Democrats) that the Republican Party has an even higher concentration of conservatives. If Obama turns things around, and his approval rating hovers around 60%, it will be hard for Obama to be picked as an extreme candidate, and many moderate Republicans will break, and with a \"Tea Party\" candidate, even some conservative candidates will break off. If Obama can show a clear vision for controlling spending, and controlling the national debt, can have passed dynamic policies to control waste and make the government more efficient, Obama might get a serious % of the vote of \"fiscal conservatives.\"<br /><br />The question should just be how will the third-party candidates affect the race, not whether a third party candidate would be viable.<br /><br />If someone like Ron Paul ran as a third-party candidate and got just 5% of the vote in the general election on the Libertarian ticket, that would increase Obama's spread over the Republican Party candidate, while also have a very fiscal conservative Republican (Ron Paul) attack the GOP and it's candidates of not being true fiscal conservatives.<br /><br />In the general election, someone like Ron Paul stealing 5 points from the Republican candidate, even if Obama would win otherwise, that increases his margin, and would depress Republican turnout.<br /><br />The ideal situation for Obama would be Sarah Palin losing the primary and running as a third-party candidate, as I actually think she could get 10-15% of the General Election vote, especially if the GOP picks someone that is not super super conservative. This would completely screw up the electoral map for the GOP.<br /><br />Michael Bloomberg I don't see becoming the dynamic candidate Ross Perot does. His self-proclaimed credentials as having this ability to work across party lines, has not been demonstrated outside of New York City politics, he has had no role in Washington, or national policy, other then to lead this \"Mayors Against Illegal Guns\" group. He is not a strong campaigner, and being an old, rich, white, unmarried, short, Jewish, New Yorker is not something that will help in getting votes in Iowa or Ohio.<br /><br />Fox News would give no time to this third party candidate even if he is farther to the right, more conservative. They just wouldn't.<br /><br />The Liberal Democrats (far left) will understand the situation Obama is in (if the Democrats lose House/Senate seats in 2010) and will not accuse Obama of being a conservative if he can't pass the amount of progressive policy they'd iike, and then push for far-left liberal candidate like Ralph Nader. That won't happen. The super-far-right Republicans won't break off and support a Tea Party candidate as that will probably be the GOP nominee.<br /><br />So where will this third party come from if it is not a party to the right of the GOP or left of the Democratic Party? Someone in the middle, who promises to bring the two parties together? Anyone who understands the GOP strategy understands the GOP is determined to block progressive agenda, will work to defeat any President whether a Democrat or Independent Party President that has a goal to have real reforms. Some third party candidate running in the middle, is running as someone who can bring the two parties together, but who would be able to sell that, if they have never served in national politics, as everyone in the House and Senate is a Democrat or Republican, other than Joe Lieberman-CT and Bernie Sanders-VT, neither of which would get more then 1% of the vote.<br /><br />There is no room for a third party. The only third party possibility is people fed up that the GOP lost it's way. If Obama can get broad support for his policies, and the GOP tries to block everything, perhaps someone who pitches themself as a true fiscal conservative, some corporate CEO-type person, has somewhat sensical solutions, and is seen as having integrity, that might absorb the Republicans that flee the Tea Party-ruled GOP.", "recommendationCount": 3}, {"assetID": 1921410, "replies": [], "lft": 44, "assetURL": "http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/odds-against-third-party-bid-not-as-long-as-they-seem/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2634650, "rgt": 45, "userDisplayName": "pierce.moffett", "createDate": "1286244532", "userID": 12668404, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1286255252", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "portland, or", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1286251652", "commentSequence": 21, "commentBody": "Speculation about Sarah Palin running for president seems so off base to me.

This place is cerebral.  Must be some miscreants from The American Spectator.<br /><br />Anyhow, while I think Nate has pretty much nailed the analysis of why there are a lot of background conditions perfvect for a 3rd part Presidential candidate, I think he is far too sanguine about the ability of anyone to actually get the necessary traction.<br /><br />As one said on here, the likelihood of a serious 3rd party bid (this would really be \"independent\", like Ross Perot, as they would not have any real party behind them) would likely come from the very right  (Tea Partier types) who realize that nothing much changes when the Republicans gain control of Congress (or at least the House).<br /><br />And as another said, the best prospect for a real third party movement gaining traction is through the takeover of an existing party (we may be seeing this, although it will surely take a few election cycles).<br /><br />The money thing is far too big an impediment to anyone making a serious challenge.  Michael Bloomberg is small potatoes (and he seems to be D-inclined anyway -- hence all the rumours of him as the next secretary of the treasury).  Having a couple hundred million ain't even close. Obama spent that much.  Perot had a couple of billion, and he was kind of crazy.  And what did he spend, like $100 million?  And that was the equivalent of 4 generations ago int erms of how things have changed.<br /><br />Friedman spins very nice stories.  And he is mostly right in his analysis of what ails our society as far as I am concerned (his books, especially so).  But it ain't gonna happen.  Why?  Most of the posts in here tell the story.  The people just aren't up to it.  The system has beaten them downs, chewed them up and spit them out.  Therre hopes of change have been dashed and destroyed by the perversity and perversion that is the political system.  People just want to protect what they have, hope that they can keep it, struggle to make ends meet, and don't have any energy left to battle with the machine anymore.<br /><br />Until the money that drives the system is taken out of play, America's future prospects are very bleak indeed.", "recommendationCount": 5}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

Hmm, no advertising within 200 feet of a park: does that relate only to 3rd party advertising (billboard for Acme Auto Detailing, e.g.) or also to premises advertising (J&R's signs, on its own buildings)?   This matter is enforced by DoB, and the way to proceed is to complain to them;  my experience is that they are very responsive.  One problem is that a) City Hall Park is \"the mayor's park\", and generally what he says goes, as with the Guiliani years.

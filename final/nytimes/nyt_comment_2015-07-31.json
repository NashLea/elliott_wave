I remember watching the comedy show \"In Living Color\" back in 1992, in which Jim Carrey played a LA police Sargent Stacy Koon lecturing his police academy students.  He said,  \"That's him.  Kill the bastard with the video camera\".  A hilarious sketch.  20 years after the Rodney King video taped assault and finally people are waking up to our incompetent thuggish police forces.

I had no say in the matter of course,  but only learned later on in my young life how popular his stories were.     Years later,  I read Shel Silverstein's wonderful stories and poem's to my own son while he was growing up,  not Seuss.

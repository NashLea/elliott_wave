But consider that a price on fossil-derived carbon would in effect do the research for you.  <br/><br/>By attaching a cost to fossil fuels, in proportion to the amount of CO2 they release when combusted, the suppliers of fossil fuels and of goods which are fossil fuel intensive to produce will have to incorporate the increased cost into their products, if they want to stay in business.  No economic research is needed since the full-cycle environmental costs would be incorporated into pricing.  That would steer small and large decisions of what to buy and where to invest.    <br/><br/>As a policy prescription, this is about as good as it gets - it steers the economy into more sustainable technologies in a way which naturally incorporates the full-cycle climate (CO2) impacts which your post raises. Given the risks which increasing atmospheric CO2 poses to the climate of the only planet we have, it's critical that we reward the best technologies for the long run by adopting some form of pricing of fossil carbon.  The policy proposed by Citizens' Climate Lobby, called Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend, does this while preserving a robust economy and protecting low income Americans.

However I am amazed at the rise of love/hate opinions about the iPad, which seem worse than the opinions blasted about the iPhone, which were heated at times. I think both Google and Apple make great products, which is great for consumers. Competition keeps the pressure on them to continue to improve their devices/software.<br /><br />The interesting thing that fascinates me is that Apple entered the virgin tablet market with a great product, but did not overprice the iPad with a 'premium' price but rather a low entry price point that stunned consumers and their competition. I believe that this was the one detail that delayed the competition from going head to head with the iPad. Now Apple has the 2nd gen iPad ready to go, and Honeycomb is still in its arrival and priced way over the iPad. Combining this with the eco-system of the app store, retail stores with helpful and savvy customer service, and it appears to be 'game over' for the competitors. I think that Apple was not content to make a great product and have it separate itself from other tablets just on form and function alone; they have that business model down to a science. No, they upped the ante by making a great product, selling it and entrenching it for over a year before any others arrived, and undercutting the one real advantage its competitors have used against Apple over the years.....the price.<br /><br />I want one, and I'm saving my pennies now!

The basic properties of these gases are not in question. What is in question is how they behave in the atmosphere. Global warming cannot happen if these gases are not actually blocking the infrared radiation that is leaving the earth despite their presence in the atmosphere. It so happens that Ferenc Miskolczy, using NOAA database of weather ballo;n observations that goes back to 1948, has demonstrated that \"...the global average annual infrared thickness of the atmosphere has been unchanged for 61 years, with a value of 1.87. It will be inferred that CO2 does not affect the climate through the greenhouse effect.\" As far as I am concerned, this is correct  As I pointed out the satellite record shows that within the last 31 years there was only one short spurt of global warmiing, non-anthropogenic, and no other warming if you don't include Arctic warming. Arctic warming is actually the only real warming that is happening now and its cause is warm Atlantic currents invading the Arctic and not CO2 as  loudly touted by warming advocates. Miskolczi's result is purely empirical and overrides any calculations from theory. Theory that yields a different result must either be adjusted or abandoned.

HIGHLIGHT by Mark, Dallas:<br />\"I'll say it again, it's not about the past or the future, it's about today. Forget the tree rings, ice cores and models. If we go to work now, what are the benefits of a national effort to reduce greenhouse gasses? What are the economic risks of doing nothing?\" Apparently he wants to discount science (those tree rings, ice cores, and models) and start reducing greenhouse gases right now. And then he wants to know what are the benefits of doing so and what are the risks of doing nothing. It is not clear to me on what basis he wants to reduce greenhouse gases if he does not want to bother with science. But as long as he is asking for answers, here they are: benefit of reducing greenhouse gases: nil. That is because there is no global warming they are supposed to cause. And economic risks of doing nothing? Nil, and for the same reason. I recommend that he should attempt to inform himself about real climate science before he comes out with any more brilliant ideas and spring for \"What Warming?\" available on Amazon right now.", "recommendationCount": 10}, {"assetID": 2495443, "replies": [], "lft": 1210, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/politics/09king.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3507040, "rgt": 1211, "userDisplayName": "David Bartlett", "createDate": "1299733219", "userID": 53449194, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299733780", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 1, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Lake Superior, MI", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299733780", "commentSequence": 521, "commentBody": "It is not that simple.<br /><br />A great many liberal Democrats here in America also supported the Irish Republican Army during its existence----some privately, others very publicly.

Furthermore, the preceding comments are very helpful in giving perspective on the questioned drug trials.  I study a little philosophy avocationally.  I also read the NYTimes Stone series on how philosophy can impact on daily lives.  Why doesn't a philosopher write a column exposing the illogical thinking that goes on in drug trials and the thinking about antidepressants?  Of course, the use of antidepressants and the publishing related to it are all about the mind-body dilemma that philosophers are forever wrestling with.   I've been taking antidepressants over 20 years.  I now take one with fish oil that enables me to function fairly well.  The last six months I have been seeing a psychoanalyst, and I attend weekly group therapy.  This therapy (especially the group) has been hell at times.  As I (my personality, my emotions, my desires) clash with the persons of the group, I only hope and pray that I'm able to face my difficulties in relationships with an open (and humble!) mind.  It's not easy!!!  I especially appreciate the comments that call for longer term studies (over a lifetime) of how antidepressants and a depressed person get along.  I have quit antidepressant several times but with very poor results.  I really think that antidepressants change my brain mostly for the better.  But if I stop taking them I will feel worse physically and emotionally than I ever felt before. (Marcia Angell's article in the NYRB addressed this outcome.  The antidepressants kind of take over for the work for the synapses.  The synapses are not ready to go back to work on their own when the antidepressant is stopped.)  Oh, once we I stopped the drugs, my depression returned in the form of fibromyalgia (scapular and temporal mandibular joint pain for me).  Back on the drugs I found relief.

While I agree with other commenters who noted that he failed to acknowledge alternative modalities, including exercise, I would argue that these alternative approaches have not been sufficiently studied. In a perfect world, we would all exercise and rates of  Diabetes, Heart Diseases, and some Cancers would be drastically reduced. However, anyone who has worked as a clinician will tell you that getting an individual to engage in daily exercise (or even three times a week) is a very difficult enterprise. The studies which measure exercise vs antidepressant use as a cure for depression do not factor for patient compliance; they measure a compliant population.<br/><br/>Kramer also supplies a badly needed balance to \"soft-science articles\" which have gone viral and had far-ranging influence. In the article that was almost certainly the mostly widely read and cited, the author a) had a degree in humanities rather than science or even psychology b) did not counter the anti-anti-depressant argument with any interviews or counter arguments or interviews c) displayed a rather stunning lack of journalistic ethics.  The author failed to disclose that he/she had written two previous books (based on almost no scientific data) on curing depression through some controversial concepts, without medication.

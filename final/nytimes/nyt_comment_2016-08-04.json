Look at Barry Bonds: he's Miami's hitting coach, and he's never really admitted anything about juicing. ARod doesn't shy away from it anymore, and you don't even have to wait for an interviewer to bring it up. Somebody suggested asking his teammates what they think of him. It's been done, often, and the vast majority of them feel lucky to be on the same team as he is. I think even Jeter has made up with him. He's got one of the greatest baseball IQ's in history, and he seems to have learned what Bonds, Pete Rose and a lot of others never did about taking responsibility. Sometimes you can learn more about what not to do from someone who did it than from someone who never did.

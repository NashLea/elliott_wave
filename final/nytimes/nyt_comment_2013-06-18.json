No one wants to talk about how most Americans are unwilling to defer consumption. It is not just 1% who keep ordering expensive Starbucks drinks regularly or using iPhones with a thousand dollars a year cell phone bill (plus hundreds in iTunes charges)! If consumers are choosing these over retirement savings, why should those who are frugal pay more taxes to take care of the spendthrift's retirement years?<br/>We are in a free country where you get to make choices and face the consequences of those choices. I sympathize with those who don't have good incomes but that is only a small part of the story. Spending choices, lifestyle choices (including single parenthood) are all contributors.

The NMR/MRI machine aligns the spins of the nucleons in the atoms in the patient using a big magnet.

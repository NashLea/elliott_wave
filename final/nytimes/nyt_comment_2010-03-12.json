Let me present the restaurant's side here: The whole point of corkage (and yes, cakeage) fees are to make up for lost revenue -- desserts not ordered from the menu, the cutlery and plates provided, and the extra time the table is occupied when it could be turned over to another paying customer.  Corkage and cakeage are also meant to allow patrons to bring in something *special* that isn't available from the restaurant: some special vintage wine, a decorated birthday cake, etc.  NOT some leftover cake in a takeaway box.  Also, it's common practice to inform the restaurant while making the reservation that you would like to bring in something, partly to make sure that both sides are clear on what's going on, fees involved, and the server is properly informed.<br /><br />Restaurants aren't charitable operations.  They exist to make a profit!  Clearly, the server could've handled the situation in a better way, but I don't see why people are so outraged.<br /><br />Julia's Love Child<br /><a href=\"http://juliaslovechild.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://juliaslovechild.tumblr.com</a><br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 5}, {"assetID": 1246828, "replies": [], "lft": 38, "assetURL": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/this-takes-the-cake/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1685747, "rgt": 39, "userDisplayName": "Kenneth Ranson", "createDate": "1268356823", "userID": 3332728, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1268371608", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Salt Lake City", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1268371608", "commentSequence": 21, "commentBody": "Bookseller<br /><br />She didn't use their facilities for nothing, she bought lunch.

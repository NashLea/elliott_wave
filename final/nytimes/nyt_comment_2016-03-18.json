It was my worry about Ibama during the primaries in 2008--he was not understanding the prior 20 years' worth of GOP behavior, particularly obvious under Bill Clinton's presidency. Leaving aside the ridiculousness of that GOP position and the insidious bases behind it, I believe Obama was unable, due to the makeup of Congress &amp; the completely insane forces driving the decisions of the right  (now personified by Trump), to accomplish more than he has. His \"establishment-ness\" is nothing more than the end result of trying to legislate \"hope &amp; change\" with a crowd of unintelligent &amp; unempathetic legislators  who couldn't care less about the people they're meant to serve. The blame for not getting  the \"hope &amp; change\" we voted for--by a landslide in 2012--lies with Congress, not Obama.

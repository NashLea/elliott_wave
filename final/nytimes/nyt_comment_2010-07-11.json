Without denying that many human problems can not be resolved by examination of ethical principles, most ethicists point to some problems about which there is an overlapping consensus among most ethical positions. Climate change surprisingly raises many issues about which such universal claims can be made. One place to look for universal agreement is when nations have actually agreed in either soft or hard law documents that certain principles represent ethically responsible behavior of  nations. In the case of climate change, the United States and 180 other countries have already agreed on the following in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that:<br />1. No nation may harm another nation by its release of greenhouse gases, or more specifically that  nations \"have the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,\"<br />2. All nations should as of 1992 adopt policies to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system based upon equity (notice not national interest)<br />3. No country may use scientific uncertainty as an excuse for  taking cost-effect actions to reduce the threat of climate change. (This is a principle widely ignored by opponents to climate change policies)<br />4. The developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.<br />5. The developed countries (including the US  have special responsibilities to  the least developed countries for climate change. (By  the way  this principle was agreed to by George Bush the first in 1992 because it was clear to by all that the rich countries have caused most of the climate change problem and this is very well documented by negotiators at that time<br /><br />Most opponents of climate change policies in the United States either are ignorant of these well settled normative principles or choose to ignore them. If there position is that the United States should not be bound by them, even though it is by the force law and and the US promise in ratifying the UNFCCC ,that makes these principles  universally binding, opponents at the very minimum, should be required to identify rational arguments why these principles don't represent ethical minimums.  Yet, time and time again we hear opponents of climate change policies appeal to short term economic arguments that implicitly deny that the United States has duties to prevent harm to others from climate change, a matter which is well settled. This puts the opponents of  climate change policies in the position of basing their entire position on lack of scientific poof for climate change damages. Yet, the US has already agreed it would not use this excuse in the UNFCCC, as a matter of ethics,  as we explained before, the burden of proof for something so dangerous lies with the skeptics, and the no harm principle has been interpreted by international courts to require nations to take action that could cause harm once they are on reasonable notice that their actions could cause harm, that is long, long before absolute proof is available.<br /><br />In addition although clauses such as \"all nations should  reduce their emissions on the basis of equity to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with  the climate system\" requires further interpretation and therefore are  questions which different parties might reasonably disagree about, not all interpretations of this requirement are entitled to respect as a matter of ethics just because some disagree. For  instance, I cant say I am entitiled to emit more ghg becaue I have brown eyes. Principles of distributive justice require that differences of how burdens should be shared must be based upon morally relevant reasons. One of the arguments that this principle excludes is the one most frequently heard in the US, the US should not reduce its emissions because it hurts US ieconimic terests. This passes no ethical test. Ethics and international law requires the US to acknowledge, duties, responsibilities and obligations to others for  climate change not base domestic policy on on  national interest. Yet, all most all arguments against US policy on climate change appear ethither cost arguments to  the US alone (an argument which by the ways conveniently ignores the cost on non-action  to the whole world.) or claims that there is no scientific proof.<br /><br />And so strong ethical principles can be made about some climate change issues, others are subject to reasonable disagreement, and others we can spot injustice even though we may disagree about what justice requires.

What accumulating evidence? Using NOAA's database of weather balloon observations Ferenc Miskolczi has shown that the infrared optical thickness of the atmosphere has not changed for the last 61 years. What this means is that constant addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere for the last 61 years has not had any influence on the already-existing greenhouse effect. To put it another way: the infrared absorption band of the atmosphere is saturated and does not respond to addition of carbon dioxide to air. Others have made this claim but now we have empirical confirmation of it. Climate change does exist but it is not caused by carbon dioxide - that is the key observation that the global warming enthusiasts have to reconcile themselves with.

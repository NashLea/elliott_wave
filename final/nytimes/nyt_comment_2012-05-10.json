People are physical but they have a soul (so they are also spiritual).<br/><br/>As such, the point of insitutions like religious institutions is to support the growth of the spiritual and reduce the influence of the weaknesses of the physical. In other words, the religious experience is not just a personal struggle but ALSO a SOCIAL endeavor.<br/><br/>In the past, Americans saw that the government (as we are a democracy) represented to some degree that social endeavor. There is a reason that some of the language used in our historical texts like the Constitution has a religious component. The government was suppose to represent the hopes, dreams, ambitions and potential of the entire population and that often meant dealing with the duality of human nature (e.g. crime and punishment, opportunity and charity, freedom and responsibility).<br/><br/>Current political discussion of the role of government seems to ignore all of this history. The entire conservative dogma seems to speak about money, individual achievement, personal ambition and competition (instead of cooperation). I am reminded so often how the people who are being asked to absorb the losses of the recession are the people with the least to give and that the people who have the most are asking for more.

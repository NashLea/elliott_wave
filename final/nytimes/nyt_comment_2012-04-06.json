While the exemption for current death row inmates is unfortunate, Connecticut would be the fifth state to abolish the death penalty since 2007 (Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and New Mexico are the other four), and there would now be 17 states in the US that do not have a death penalty. <br/><br/>The death penalty is barbaric, ineffective, biased, and costly.  The evidence shows that the death penalty costs taxpayers more than life in prison without parole, does not deter violent crime, and is marred by significant racial bias and far too frequent ineffective legal representation for those who are charged with capital crimes.   Since 1973, at least 138 people have been released from death row after being proven innocent, and there are at least 23 cases in the last century of people who have been killed by the death penalty but are now believed to be innocent of the crimes they were killed for.<br/><br/>In short, it is well beyond time for the death penalty to be abolished. We should celebrate if Connecticut does so, thank the officials there who voted to end it, and then work on getting rid of the death penalty in the remaining 33 states and the federal government. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 12}, {"assetID": 3315079, "replies": [], "lft": 102, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/opinion/krugman-not-enough-inflation.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 5927211, "rgt": 107, "userDisplayName": "Paul A.

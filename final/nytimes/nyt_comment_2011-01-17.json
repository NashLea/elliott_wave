It should be noted that both JPM's Jamie Dimon and his favorite federal regulatory playmate, the FDIC's Sheila Bair, have been united in their ideological certainty that shareholders must take the hit for the failures of corporate management.  (Neither has advanced an opinion on the failures of federal regulatory agencies; Mr Dimon hires from agencies such as the SEC.)  Since it is the Obama administration that is currently in a position to attempt to reform our toxic financial system, it would be prudent to examine how those in power might influence the future flow of dividends.<br /><br />James Lieber, writing in the Village Voice, advised, in October, 2009:<br /><br />\"People who expect President Obama's Department of Justice to take the lead will be severely disappointed \u2014 not necessarily because the task is difficult, but because the Obama administration is showing that it lacks the will.<br /><br />Instead, the new administration is putting its energy into creating what it believes will be a meltdown-proof new system of elite 'too-big-to-fail' banks, regulated by a beefed-up Federal Reserve.\"<br /><br />Further,<br /><br />\"...the nation's new top prosecutor, Attorney General Eric Holder, has a history of preferring that deviant corporations be held to no more than a 'voluntary cooperation' system in which they investigate themselves privately.<br /><br />Under the 'Holder Memo,' which he wrote in 1999 as deputy AG in the Clinton administration, bad-boy executives and their corporations who turn over evidence to the government qualify for lenient sentences and fines and, sometimes, for settlements without even indictments. The consequences of their crimes often amount to only the cost of doing business.<br /><br />After leaving government, Holder followed the mandates of his own memo and made a lucrative living by conducting internal probes for companies and negotiating outstanding results for white-collar clients. He was public about it: Holder's 2002 op-ed 'Don't Indict WorldCom' in The Wall Street Journal argued on behalf of the corporate perpetrator of one of the sleaziest frauds of the past decade.\"<br /><a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-10-27/news/we-ve-bailed-out-the-banks-when-do-we-go-after-the-crooks-behind-our-financial-collapse/2/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.villagevoice.com...</a><br /><br />Louise Story, writing in this newspaper last month about \"the secretive banking elite [that] rules trading in derivatives,\" quoted an anonymous DOJ spokeswoman in saying that \"[t]he department\u2019s antitrust unit is actively investigating 'the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries.'\"<br /><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nytimes.com...</a><br /><br />Investors, it would seem, would be wise to take a circumspect position regarding the dividends distributed by the TBTF institutions that circumscribe virtually every interpretation of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 2296366, "replies": [], "lft": 184, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/business/14dividend.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3238761, "rgt": 185, "userDisplayName": "timey", "createDate": "1295099268", "userID": 5946162, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1295241439", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Westchester", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1295241439", "commentSequence": 85, "commentBody": "Citibank is instituting a $100 or $200 annual fee on their investment accounts in 2011.

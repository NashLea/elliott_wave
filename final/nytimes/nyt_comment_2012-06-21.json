Yet, while Issa incessantly tries to conjure up a scandal against Holder, he refuses to even call the AG under Bush, Michael Mukasey, who started the program. <br/><br/>Second, Issa's witch hunt is being motivated by his belief in a conspiracy theory - namely, that Holder purportedly decided to continue the Fast &amp; Furious program started by the Bush DOJ in order to create a crisis that would enable the Obama Administration to infringe on Second Amendment rights. The conspiracy theory is laughable on its face, especially given that Obama, unfortunately, has done virtually nothing to promote sensible gun safety legislation.<br/><br/>Third, Holder has already produced more than 7,000 pages of documents.

This has been offset over the decades, by a series of bubbles (tech in 90's, internet around millennium, then the housing bubble (biggest of all).  During this time, interest rates have been trending ever downward - meaning that sufficient demand was only obtained by ever-increasing borrowing by the have-lesses, made possible by the low interest rates.

In fact, even at the peaks of these bubbles, wage pressures never got very high.

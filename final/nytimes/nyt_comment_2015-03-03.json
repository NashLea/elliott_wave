That makes it hard to explain all the wars of conquest that have been fought throughout history. Genocide is wrong? Yet it has taken place throughout history when groups battle over limited resources. There are many things we believe today, for example, about what marriage is and what is acceptable sexual behavior, that will probably be seen in the future as unfathomable, just as (most of us) look back at racial segregation.<br/><br/>It is disturbing to some, but there are no absolute moral truths.

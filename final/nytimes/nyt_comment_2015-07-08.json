They had industry, a new functioning government, infrastructure, and let's not forget - Europe and the U.S. needed a strong Germany as a barrier against the Soviet Union, so the debt wasn't cut for the sole purpose of helping the German people. So the debt was cut and Germany did their own thing to get out of the miserable situation they were in.<br/><br/>Greece does not have that structure at the moment. The Troika were put in place to help them build the structure that is necessary for them in the future to make it without loans. If the debt was cut now before all these measures are in place, what reason does the Greek government have to change what brought them into the situation in the first place? It was never a question of whether the debt will be cut for Greece, it was always a matter of when. That so-called \"austerity\" helped other countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, so it can't be all that wrong. And what would these countries say if Greece was dealt with in a completely different way? If Greek debt was cut now, that would not be the end of the line; Greece would need more loans even after that.<br/><br/>Everyone praises the Greek referendum - but one country cannot possibly dictate to the EU - and other democratic nations - what the terms should be for giving them more money.", "recommendationCount": 39}, {"assetID": 3433047, "replies": [], "lft": 1327, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/business/international/greece-debt-eurozone-meeting.html", "parentID": 15424666, "commentID": 15425028, "rgt": 1328, "userDisplayName": "AgentG", "createDate": "1436325256", "userID": 32447433, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1436328579", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Austin,TX", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1436324979", "commentSequence": 15425028, "commentBody": "With all the love for the Greeks and the Germans, the Greeks don't appear ready to take their chance.

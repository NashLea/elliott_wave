The muddled warning messages by the scientific community and an inefficient communication system to the public resulted in the realization of some of the dire warnings that emanated from groups who stressed the importance of curbing the business-as-usual practice that was inherently unstable.<br /><br />The consequences may not have been as large as the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs, but they were eventually as significant as going in and out of an ice age, the impacts were realized over a relatively rapid time period (over just a couple of generations).  This was the most significant climate change that was ever experienced in the timeframe of civilization, and occurred when human population and settlement patterns were such that migration to more adaptable climate zones was extremely difficult.<br /><br />Human beings began to have a significant impact on their surrounding environment around the start of the agricultural revolution.  Over several thousands of years there was a radical global paradigm shift from small groups of people that were hunting and gathering to survive, to the rapid expansion of population that began to settle down into cities.  Some authors of the 20th century, such as Daniel Quinn, viewed such behavior as stemming from an inherent feeling toward the \u201cspecialness of man\u201d which justified their domination of non-civilized cultures, rainforests, or other biological habitats, in much the same way as Adolf Hitler\u2019s mythology of Aryan superiority justified his war on much of Europe.  However, no event over the course of human civilization was as large on a global scale, and yet so avoidable as the onset of the radical climate shift which began in the 20th century and became so pronounced over the next century.<br /><br />The warnings from the climate science community could only be heard by those people that listened.  A solid foundation in the relevant issues needed to make informed decisions could not be found in primary schooling, or even for most people in college.  Despite the principles behind how climate change operated being well-rooted in physics and adequately verified from those who study the past climate behavior, there was still a strange amount of focus given to the precise language used by scientists who argued over terminology such as \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201cvirtually certain\u201d or \u201calmost\u201d which is useful in scientific setting but proved impractical to the general public.<br /><br />Ironically, the revolution in the accessibility of information played a large role in the lack of suitable action that was needed to stabilize emissions of gases that caused global climate change.  This came primarily in two ways.  First, there was a considerable industry devoted to popularizing false information.  This may have been due to a perceived short-term threat to the status quo, personal gain for spreading this disinformation, but regardless of the rationale for such behavior, a large amount of confusion was spread to the general public concerning the scientific understanding of how climate change operated.  On the other hand, media reports often exaggerated the conclusions that would appear in the scientific literature, or used icons to emotionalize the impacts of climate change, which resulted in a lack of appreciation for the real biological and social concerns of a changing world. In fact, much of the public became largely disinterested in the subject, and the threat of a changing climate would not even appear on the top of lists highlighting the main problems of the time period.<br /><br />Continued...", "recommendationCount": 8}, {"assetID": 1157248, "replies": [], "lft": 102, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/a-historian-looks-back-at-the-climate-fight/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1562347, "rgt": 103, "userDisplayName": "Chris Colose", "createDate": "1266034000", "userID": 54316249, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266037813", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "New York", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266037813", "commentSequence": 51, "commentBody": "The second reason that the accessibility of information actually played a role in the confusion for how to handle climate change was the illusion that any person could instantly become an expert in multiple fields.  This became a time when only hours worth of easily accessible research gave some the personal feeling that they were in position to challenge experts who spent decades studying the subtle nuances of the field.  Hundreds of years of tradition of publishing results in academic journals and being scrutinized by peers was replaced by flashy postings of information which could instantly be read by millions of people, and this online database of information became an authority of its own.<br /><br />The result was that authority was no longer sought after in the manner it once was, and the reality of how climate change was influencing society became as much of a personal preference as what type of food people like to eat.  It also became the first time in history in which the scientific community as a whole could be collectively accused of spreading false information, even when a small group of individuals spoke uncarefully or made a mistake.  In the early 21st century, a key report issued by the United Nations mistakenly claimed that Himalayan glaciers would disappear over just several decades.  Despite the fact that glaciers around the world had been melting and were projected to continue to melt, and despite this claim not even being a central component to the report, the mistake was quickly translated into suspicious acts by the entire scientific community and flaws in the whole structure of the science behind global warming.<br /><br />To be fair, at the time when climate change became a significant problem, there was no adequate alternate structure by which the lifestyle at the time could be maintained.  There was also not enough attention given to searching out alternate methods to maintain that lifestyle.  Just like a canoe ready to go over a waterfall, there was no attempt to abandon ship, but rather to simply row harder and delay the catastrophic fall.  We are now paying the price for this lack of desire to evolve in culture, and to get off the addictive drug that was cheap and easy energy.<br /><br />This is the most pronounced analog to our modern situation (insert human problem in hundreds of years here) whereby we are warned to take significant action, and yet we are repeatedly being told by non-experts that there is in fact no problem, if there is a problem that we're not able to change it, or that even if we could it would be better to adapt to it.  These views are all hard to reconcile yet our decision on how to approach it has severe repercussions for ourselves and future generations.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 1157248, "replies": [], "lft": 104, "assetURL": "http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/a-historian-looks-back-at-the-climate-fight/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1562471, "rgt": 105, "userDisplayName": "Girma", "createDate": "1266037034", "userID": 56529217, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266037849", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Perth, Australia", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266037849", "commentSequence": 52, "commentBody": "You wants us to comment on \u201canticipating how the current period might appear in, say, 100 years\u201d<br /><br />One of the greatest scientific stuff ups, or one of the greatest scientific fibs of all times.

Read this:<br /><br />A celebrated athlete, a catalyst for change in society\u2019s attitudes and a man dedicated to making a difference, Rick Hansen is best known as Canada\u2019s Man In Motion.<br /><br />At the age of 15, Rick Hansen sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI) in a car crash. Paralyzed from the waist down, he slowly came to terms with how to deal with his new life, setting new goals from new dreams. After months of rehabilitation, Rick returned to his first passion: sports. Fuelled by his mantra \u2018anything is possible\u2019, he went on to win 19 international wheelchair marathons, including six medals as a Paralympian.<br /><br />Inspired by the dream of a world accessible and inclusive for all, and a passion to make a difference in the lives of others, Rick set out on a journey, his legendary Man In Motion World Tour, on March 21, 1985 . Rick wheeled more than 40,000km through 34 countries, raising $26 million for SCI research and quality of life programs. More importantly was the collective shift in consciousness in the belief of the potential of people with disabilities when barriers are removed.<br /><br />A recipient of the Companion Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia Rick continues to have a far reaching impact on the world of sport. He chaired the Commission for the Inclusion of Athletes with Disabilities, a special committee of the International Paralympic Committee, successful in creating full medal status for Commonwealth Games athletes and, in 1980, was named \u2018Athlete of the Century\u2019 by British Columbia Wheelchair Sport. .<br /><br />March 21, 2010 will mark the 25th anniversary of the day Rick embarked on his Man In Motion World Tour, and today, his journey continues. As President &amp; CEO of the Rick Hansen Foundation, he has helped to generate $200 million for SCI research and quality of life programs. His efforts have continued to improve the prognosis for newly injured individuals and have increased support and care for those living with SCI providing opportunities for them to live to their full potential.<br /><br />Despite a lifetime of accomplishments, Rick believes his best work is in front of him as he expands the work of his Foundation internationally and continues to pursue those dreams that first inspired the Man In Motion World Tour; to find a cure for SCI and to build on the great example Canada has become in making the world fully accessible and inclusive for everyone. His passion and commitment to making an extraordinary difference in the lives of others continues.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 1158557, "replies": [], "lft": 160, "assetURL": "http://vancouver2010.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/coming-soon-live-updates-from-opening-ceremony/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1562596, "rgt": 161, "userDisplayName": "aliruba", "createDate": "1266040130", "userID": 42391808, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1266040237", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1266040237", "commentSequence": 75, "commentBody": "The \"We Are More\" ode was AWESOME.

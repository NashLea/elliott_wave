At the time, my wife's mother was \"with it,\" though now, at 94, she's frail and forgetful.  When we met with a social worker to see if she was eligible for a program in her apartment, I brought out the book and asked her to share it with anyone who was going to work with my wife's mother, because she's from the old school, is hard-wired for getting to know people and their families, and will not abide someone sitting down, getting out a clipboard or laptop and asking impersonal questions before establishing rapport.  Now with the option of free blogs online, everyone can publish their private memoirs.  I just had a 50th high school class reunion.  Our class president has established a website so we can all keep in touch with each other.  It's been a source of much enjoyment and sharing.

The only issue is how best this transfer of wealth is to be accomplished with the least negative effect on efficient pricing (see Bart's comment above). In this respect, wealth is relative, not absolute.  Again, it makes no economic sense to take X dollars from the subsidizing segment of the population and to give that same segement Y dollars back with the other hand.  Here, the difference between taxing and spending is truly blurred.<br/><br/>If nearly everyone over 65 in America is as \"poor\" as you suggest, where are the funds to come from to pay for their medical costs?  <br/><br/>The over 65 cohort have a higher median income than do some other cohorts, particularly when one considers married couples (they have much more than double the median income of singles you cite).  And, they typically have much greater wealth and fewer non-health related expenses.  If we cut spending on the relatively wealthy, we can better afford spending on those who need help the most.  <br/><br/>As for Medicare, it is already means tested.  Premiums are higher for higher-income folks.  Means testing will inevitably increase, but we are now doing this primarily be stealth.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3316332, "replies": [], "lft": 209, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/looking/", "parentID": 5997308, "commentID": 5998174, "rgt": 210, "userDisplayName": "leapfinger", "createDate": "1334480363", "userID": 51284005, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1334480414", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "durham,nc", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1334476814", "commentSequence": 70, "commentBody": "If that's all there is, I respectfully submit that, unless the clue is alterred to indicate \"erroneous usage\" or \"French\", they've given us the wrong finger...", "recommendationCount": 0}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

The coast of California has rebounded from the recession but people in the valley have not seen it. Foreclosures have taken a toll. Unemployment is 13.3% and we fit the description of one of the white house's promise zones.  These include Kentucky and the choctaw nation.  There is no one here from the 1%.

There is no benefit to people in the valley except to keep the status quo for a few. And it's sad to see how many people who have so little continually vote for people who do not have their best interests at heart but simply give them a false lifeline of hope that some day there will not be people who are immigrants or of color or of poverty or or lack or priveledge amongst them.

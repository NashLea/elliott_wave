The average grade at Stanford is a \"B+\".  This may make sense (not really)  at Stanford, where the average student is expected to be exceptional.   But the immense pressures of graduation and retention rates will mean that most students who just show up will pass in community colleges and state schools.  we will be heading into an age of rubber stamping college graduates who are not much better off in terms of analytic skills and thinking than when they graduated from high school."}]}, "lft": 6, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/upshot/washington-university-aims-to-attract-low-income-students.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 13859066, "rgt": 21, "userDisplayName": "Transparancy", "createDate": "1421385090", "userID": 57262485, "replyCount": 7, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1421385127", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Belmont Ca", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1421385127", "commentSequence": 13850720, "commentBody": "Wash U has been labeled Coddle University for some time. That fact must be known by the administration of Wash U. Top students express disdain for the use of luxury to attract students with money and the very students that Wash U is trying to attract are turned off by it. That is, top students from wealthy households speak of Wash U in critical tones because the perception is that they are trying to attract students via coddling, absurd luxuries and deference to privilege. Even their decision to expand aid reeks of something different than (and less than) a true commitment to  finding ways to help educate capable students not able to pay exorbitant tuition. And, tuition would not be exorbitant if not for the luxuries they have built into their climate in an attempt to attract wealthy students. The very top students, even the wealthy ones, see exactly where Wash U's  money has been spent and they tend to choose against attending. They see the lack of need blind admissions, the huge preference given to legacies and they decide to attend universities with better values.  So Wash U gets a lot of those students swayed by a posh and coddling academic climate. Is that not working for them any more?", "recommendationCount": 44}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

First, NNT isn't measured, it's calculated by multiplying probabilities from various studies. Neither probability of disease nor of benefit is known with certainty; they vary from person to person in ways that are neither fully understood nor precisely measurable. Multiplication of uncertainties gives more uncertainty; the idea that an NNT of 30 is better than one of 31, or even 300, is highly questionable. NNTs should include confidence limits multiplying upper and lower limits of all the studies from which they are derived. Emphatic about the uncertainty of benefits from intervention, the referenced website fails to convey this uncertainty of derived NNTs in any useful way. Second, Zeno's the guy who said to walk a league, you had to walk half a league, and half of that, and so on. Since intervening fractions are infinite, it's impossible. As it is in fact possible to walk a league, this logic is perniciously wrong, but NNT invites it by analyzing interventions singly instead of cumulatively. How long and how many interventions are enough? The NNT for not smoking that next cigarette is probably in the billions, if calculable at all, so you might as well smoke it anyway, heart attacks and lung disease be damned. NNT is by nature a nihilist approach to all interventions, including preventive ones. But the cumulative public health impact of not doing these interventions is huge.

Of all the eating establishments patronized, \"THIS\" was by far the worst both in palpability and cost for the amount of food received!  My wife ordered the so-called \"Catch of the day\", which turned out to be Mahi Mahi.  The portion was about three ounces of blackened fish with cajun seasoning, about four ounces of mashed potatoes, and approximately a dozen small florets of broccoli.  The price affixed to this paltry serving turned out to be $20.  The reason that I state it this way as to the cost was due to the fact that the cost wasn't listed of the menu.  I ordered the Jumbo blackened shrimp served on a bed of alfredo fettuccine.  I was charged $18 for five shrimp, which turned out to be large instead of jumbo.  The fettuccine was totally devoid of alfredo sauce and instead contained some sort of sweet red sauce that did not fit well with either the shrimp or the pasta.   We also ordered a house salad with bleu cheese dressing and were charged $3 each with no concession considering the high prices of the entrees.  Even though we relayed our disappointment to our waiter, at no time did any one on management staff stop by our table to inquire about our meal or to address our concerns that had previously been expressed to our waiter.  During the course of sitting and partaking of our meal, a manager did pass by our table two times and neither of the two times did he acknowledge and/or ask us about how our meal was or if we had any concerns pertaining to our meal.

They always know just what to say.<br /><br />I'm glad that you posted that piece from Robin Givhan because the issue is REAL and needs to be called out much more than it is. I'll read it and get back to you.<br /><br />RC...of course there's anti-semitism and all other forms of prejudices in fashion. Why wouldn't there be? Fashion people, who usually are of a demographic minority themselves...ie women or gay men... aren't immune from bigotry than anyone else.  In some ways, the idea that minorities are somehow immune from prejudices is part of the reason why bigotry is so rampant in fashion. People are too busy seeing their own perceived/real oppression to see their own biases towards people unlike themselves.p some are just more socially acceptable than others....think the vocal and constant rejection and stigmatizing of fat people, poor people, or short people, just for starters. Why are people so angry when race/religion/sexuality are the target rather than something else...say ugliness (perceived), weight, height, social class, etc...?  I think it's because people are extremely complex beings able to condemn somethings while rationalizing others. IOW, like prejudice is a human trait...so is hypocrisy. It's apart of the human condition methinks. You'll have noticed that the anti Asian comments and the \"I will kill you\" part seems to have been lost in the sauce, right ? Needless to say, it shows quite well that all sorts of stinckin' thinkin' is afoot here, n'est-ce pas? This isn't just about Galliano...not a bit of it.<br /><br />Fashion draws its ranks from the same pool as everything does...the society in which it operates. People have been trying to figure out  since forever how to deal w/ such persistently entrenched attitudes, and so far....? I think things are better in some ways than in the past and keep improving,  but in other ways I think people simply hide their thoughts/attitudes better than they used to. At some level tho, vilifying these attitudes doesn't make them go away, but simply go underground. That doesn't mean their affects are any less real tho. Air isn't visible, but you sure feel it when it kicks up.<br /><br />In some ways I look at all this \"shock\" over Galliano's rants  as being just more hypocrisy and melodrama. The big diff between him in this instance is that he was caught on tape and caught saying something specifically considered taboo in the place he said it...anti-semitism in modern France. If he had said that in the US or even the UK (w/ or w/o the tape), I wonder if it would have had the widespread impact that it has? Frankly, I doubt it.<br /><br />Truthfully, I'm sure other prominent people in fashion have said as bad or worse and behaved as badly as Galliano, but there was no tape and/or people covered for them. I'm sure this was true for Galliano himself until last week. Much of the tone of these comments coming from the insiders  has a whiff of \"there but for the grace of God go I\" (esp Karl Lagerfeld's super cynical statement).

Given that he was a couturier, it was about as affordable as any other couture...not very, but he definitely had a major \"trickle down\" influence (very appropriate for the 80s, eh?). For me the key is \"back in the day\" tho. Everything is always new to everybody at some point, but most people aren't presenting their version of it during PFW and asking big money for it (as I'm sure they will).<br /><br />I just wonder why there's so much of a nostalgia trip w/ so many of \"the kids\" now? As much as I like Mugler, he was definitely of his time and that's partly why he's not around today designing for his label, but what has he to do w/ today? Fashion happens in it's time and context....at least much of the best fashion IMHO, tho many times it's because of that so many designers fade away.  Why is everything seeming to be a redo of something long past? Again I ask, why bother w/ this when you can get a vintage Mugler (probably cheaper, if you're lucky) or DIY it yourself?<br /><br />I'm a long time lover of designers Gareth Pugh, Olivier Theyskens, Rick Owens and the like as many here know. They all have touches of Mugler/Montana aesthetics IMHO but they put their own stamp on it and they have a contemporary feel. Many other designers are clearly inspired by them too (tho many times less obviously and less recognized as such), so it's not the aesthetic I have issue w/ but the execution and sense of the designer's personal vision/intent.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 2474449, "replies": [], "lft": 94, "assetURL": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/egyptian-antiquities-chief-resigns/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3473949, "rgt": 95, "userDisplayName": "Ann McCoy", "createDate": "1299204914", "userID": 55185642, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1299218031", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "NY", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1299218031", "commentSequence": 46, "commentBody": "The Tut show was sent on the road by Hawass to get funds for the Cairo Museum.<br />Even after the millions earned , the place was a shambles, no good security, and poorly paid curators.

There are very few French women in my opinion who are natural beauties, and most women go to bizarre lengths to conform to the national standard of attractiveness. Most women diet to the extreme, eating no breakfast, vegetable consomme (or something similar very low in calories)for lunch and a small dinner. A friend's mother reacted with horror when I asked her if she ate bread. Never, not since the war, she responded. The worst haircuts I have ever had were in Paris, when little attention is paid to the hair, just to the drying and styling. Every time my hair was cut I had to run home, take a shower, and do my hair myself. It is considered unattractive for a woman to laugh out loud. It is appropriate that this article appeared on Bastille Day, for the French art of attractiveness is one of 'l'artifice,' or appearance or fireworks. Why no mention of Jane Birkin, who has spent most of her life in France, and obviously has never had plastic surgery? La Deneuve, on the other hand . . . I remember when she turned 50, and every bus and news kiosque was decorated with the photograph of her that decorated the cover of that week's Paris Match. She gave interviews crediting her youthful appearance to giving up coffee, cigarettes and crossing her legs at the knee, as well as a new hair style. The face lift, meanwhile, was about as obvious as they come.

I'm not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination.  I AM a performer, but hardly a famous one.  I try to eat well, exercise and take good care of the skin and hair my parents were kind enough to pass along.  I must respectfully disagree with EMR. I'm in my early 50's and can pass for 38 on a good day and I haven't had a shred of work done.  Nor can I afford to. Nor would I wish to if I COULD afford it.  As someone who deals daily with the idea that being over 35 somehow renders you pointless, I have to say that I think we are giving away that which makes us beautiful as we age by trying to look like young women, and I would also submit that succumbing to the societal idea that aging is a BAD thing is to negate all that is wonderful about having lived.  Aging is a fact of life. Some of us aren't lucky enough to have the opportunity to do it.

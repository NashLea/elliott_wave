There are things to learn there.<br/><br/>\"Does a continuing depression actually serve the interests of the wealthy?\"<br/><br/>While you posit your doubts, recessions have manifold benefits for the wealthy, employer class.<br/><br/>1. Fewer new start up companies to bother their established ones. Less competition on price, the sole reason many enterprises use as their reason for being. Less competition means higher profits.<br/><br/>2. Recessions drive the weak competitors out of business. Again, less competition on price as the weak ones fall. The potential for near monopoly power in some sectors rises. This is the goal of all corporations, to control prices and the market.<br/><br/>3. Lower and less strident demands on wages and benefits from employees.<br/><br/>4. An abundance of available workers, especially those so anxious to take a job that they will work for far less.<br/><br/>5. Less job shifting by workers. Lower costs on training/hiring.<br/><br/>6. More exclusivity in the places the rich go and the things they buy. Fewer tourists in St. Barts.<br/><br/>7.Lower prices for the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th house.<br/><br/>8. More power for the rich as those below them lose money and power.<br/><br/>America's corporations are not America's any more. They are citizens, beasts, of the world, roaming the planet, taking what they like, shifting dollars and tax burdens around in a giant whirl, supporting life styles for those at the top that would make ancient kings blush. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://terryreport.com\" title=\"http://terryreport.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://terryreport.com</a>", "recommendationCount": 502}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

You could have representation with each popular vote having an equal weight in selecting the representatives.<br/><br/>The Senate is specifically designed to represent states not people. The electoral college was specifically designed not to allow the popular election of the President, though it almost always does that now. The electoral college also has nothing to do with a representative democracy.<br/><br/>Look at John Boehner refusing to bring a clean CR and debt limit increase to the house floor, because he knows it will pass with a majority of the representatives in favor. He has the political power to stop a democratic decision by our representatives in this matter.<br/><br/>When Franklin characterized the new government as a republic after the convention, he was being precise in his terminology. Most of the delegates feared a real democracy.<br/><br/>I am afraid these are not just oddities of a representative democracy. We have a republican form of government, with some democratic features.

The lower earners forced to take on more tax burden relative to their incomes, enabling the rich to amass than in Reagan's time.

After their conservatives gain power, they don't go quite as far right as ours do. Even Thatcher said every citizen must have guaranteed medical care. <br/><br/>And when their progressives regain office, with publicly financed elections, they have ways of restoring more balance to the economy.

Reagan did increase economic growth.  He was a military Keynesian who tripled the national debt from $1 to $3 trillion by the time he left office.

And to be fair the weapons we bought did come in handy in 1991 when we rented out the army to Saudi Arabia during Gulf War I.<br/><br/>By the way, the reason why we got into the 1982 recession to begin with was because the first Reagan budget was such a god-awful mess.

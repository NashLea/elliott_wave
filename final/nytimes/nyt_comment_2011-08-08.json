It has also helped me recover by re-engaging with friends, new and old, community events, political rallies and more. <br/><br/>I am an activist for social justice, volunteer to my community, event photographer and writer.  I do not care if our government knows about me.  What I really want is for my friends and acquaintances \u2013 possibly future friends \u2013 to also know about me.  <br/><br/>I primarily use facebook but have recently started to use Google Plus and Twitter.   To use social media, I mean to really share your life in it, in words, pictures and video, is to reap its value - and it has so very much value.  It has greatly improved the breath and stroke of my life.  It has not only lifted my depressed spirits, it has enabled me to meet new people, first online and then later in person, people I would have never normally met or had access to - interesting people with engaged lives \u2013 artists, writers, activists, volunteers, musicians, politicians, scientists, business consultants and professionals in many fields.<br/><br/>Social media has also enabled me to stay in touch with my diaspora of far flung and out of area friends and family.  As my facebook profile can be seen by anybody who has a facebook account, it has enabled former friends and contacts from earlier stages in my life to find me again. <br/><br/>Not all online friendships work out, however.  Thankfully, there is a solution.  If a facebook connection doesn't work out, I can block the person, something I have done only four times in the last two years.  Once blocked, the offending person can't see me and I can't see them.  Problem solved.  Google+ also has a blocking feature.<br/><br/>My social media life has been a life enriching and healing experience.   I recommend giving the act of sharing your life online a chance.

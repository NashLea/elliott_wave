My father and I would pick them after dinner and my mother, who was from a large French-Canadian family and could make masterpieces from just about any food, would make pies. She used her usual crust, with some openings on top, and just the blueberries and sugar as the filling. Mmmmm! I assume that the secret to her perfect pies was those small, dark, sweet and very fresh wild blueberries, but maybe it was love.", "recommendationCount": 9}, {"assetID": 3455400, "replies": [], "lft": 90, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/magazine/the-perfect-imperfections-of-blueberry-pie.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 19094047, "rgt": 91, "userDisplayName": "Blonde Guy", "createDate": "1468095883", "userID": 21978729, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1468123488", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Santa Cruz, CA", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1468119888", "commentSequence": 19094047, "commentBody": "I use tapioca flour.

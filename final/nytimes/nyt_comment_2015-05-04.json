This includes sports like swimming and dressage (anyone remember the cause of Christopher Reeve's terrible injury?) which are, presumably, more acceptable to the high-minded readers here. Boxers know the risks and have the right to take them. There is such a thing as an illegal punch in boxing, among other rules, and the onus falls upon the referees to enforce those. Illegal or underhanded moves can cause real injury to opponents in any sport. <br/><br/>I'd also add that I was at the heavyweight match at Madison Sq Garden two weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. The boxers were pros and had a clean, entertaining fight from which each walked away healthily. The crowd was surprisingly diverse, with many women in attendance who seemed to be enjoying themselves. <br/><br/>In my view, there is entirely too much judgement of the fans and the sport going on here masquerading as compassion for Mago.

An agonizing decision is one which is made by parents who hear that the baby they want MIGHT have a severe birth defect.  When a child is conceived by a woman who knows that she can't afford that child or that she just doesn't want a child, could be agonizing, but, abortion, in most cases, is a selfish decision.  As Obama said, it would be \"an inconvenience\".<br/><br/>Re your comment on caring for children born into abusive and extremely dysfunctional circumstances, I agree--it is a big problem.  Short of forced sterilization of the mother and father, there is no good solution.  Those children could be removed from those homes and put into institutions--I'm old and had friends in orphanages--they were healthy, clean, well-fed, and nurtured.<br/><br/>The Bible makes it clear  that abortion is murder. It also says that family members MUST help other family members, and that widows and orphans must be cared for.  True believers know this (but might not do it).  Condoning (and in some cases promoting) conception by non-committed people and those who can't properly provide for the children is not Biblical.  Providing for those children is Biblical, but, leaving them with people who will not care for them is not.<br/><br/>I imagine if true Christians were required to aid true Christians, and only non-Christians were required to aid non-Christians, those non-Christians would revolt.

Some of the ideas above are a little muddled.  Inverse functions aren't really about \"order matters\".  But they are definitely about \"can be reversed\".<br/><br/>We say that g(x) = x + 1 is an \"inverse function\" of h(x) = x - 1.  Stated differently, \"adding 1\" and \"subtracting 1\" are inverses.  If you do one of these, then do the other, you get back to where you started.  Adding one \"undoes\" subtracting one, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>When Cosman Frog ponds are combined, their populations are basically multiplied.  However, PRIOR to the multiplication step we add one, and AFTER the multiplication step we subtract one.  The Cosman Frog Product of ponds of size a and b is [(a+1) * (b+1)] - 1.  This works because the adding one and subtracting one are inverse functions.  The Fendel Frog Product is similar, except switching the adding and subtracting: [(a-1) * (b-1)] + 1.<br/><br/>\"Adding one\" and \"subtracting one\" are not the only inverse functions.  \"Multiply by 10\" and \"divide by 10\" are inverses.  \"Squared\" and \"square-root\" are inverses.  For any pair of inverses, we can create a frog species which combines in this way.  Consider \"multiply by 10\" and \"divide by 10\".  The frog product associated with these would be [(10a) * (10b)] / 10, which simplifies to 10*a*b.  The first challenge was to create a story that illustrates this.

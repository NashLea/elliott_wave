There is a philosophical divide here. Arsenal in the last decade or so have been paying off a new stadium with a policy of paying for what you buy (low net spend) in an age when massive sugar daddies from Russia and Abu Dhabi appeared. They've done OK, and despite a rash of \"Wenger Out!\" cries (now silent) their large global fanbase seems to support that.<br/><br/>In addition they have a persistent injury problem that can't just be bad luck (they're doing something wrong) and until recently a certain tactical inflexibility and preference for style over grit and guts. Their recent success is a combination of the Emirates payoff being under control (allowing the signings of the likes of Ozil and Sanchez) and newfound tactical flexibility (they've been playing the counter a lot, but they're also the only ones to have run Leicester City off the pitch). Giroud and Kosc are stepping up, Bellerin and Coq are coming into their own, and it looks like Campbell will too.<br/><br/>As for Leicester, what an amazing story. They barely hung on, lost Cambiasso, lost Pearson, and look at them now. One could be a pessimist and note that we're only 17 games out of 38, that the slog gets hard late in the winter, that Vardy, Mahrez, and Kante are logging a lot of miles and they'll have to continue that form for another 21 matches.

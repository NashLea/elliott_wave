Utley never touched second base and walked off the field. The video review focused on the fact that Tejada's toe missed the base by an inch or two, the explanation being there was no double play, ergo the \"neighborhood rule\" did not apply, ergo Tejada didn't make the out. But Utley never made the base, and that should have been the end of it. He was out.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the justification for Utley's body slam into Tejada was that he was breaking up a double play,\" then how on earth did the officials find that Tejada was not in the midst of a double play? Clearly, that is exactly what he was doing when he spun around to throw to first at the same moment that Utley tackled him.<br/><br/>Finally, It was clear Tejada had virtually no chance of getting the runner at first, whether Utley interfered with him or not. So the proper outcome here was that Utley was out, the runner at first was safe, and there were two outs in the inning. <br/><br/>As for those who decry MLB's effort to protect middle infielders, I just don't get that either. Sliding into second to disrupt a double play is one thing.  A flying body slam into a shortstop, made well outside the base path, is quite another. It is dangerous for both players, and it isn't a necessary part of the game, any more than violent collisions at home plate are. I've been watching baseball for nearly 60 years; I don't miss home plate collisions; and I won't miss body slams at second like Utley's.

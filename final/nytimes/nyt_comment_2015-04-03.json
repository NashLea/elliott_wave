In the final analysis what has been gained by this post colonial temper tantrum, which has been directed at an Iran for wanting to chart its own course on relations with the rest of the world, without seeking the approval of Washington or Tel Aviv? I think that we have all been snookered on this dog and pony show, and the foolishness, if the Republicans and Israel have anything to say about it, has only just begun.

Consequently, the price of oil will rise steeply and inexorably, probably beginning next year.  Estimates derived from the Department of Energy's own figures suggest that OPEC's reserve capacity will run out between 25 and 43 months from now.<br /><br />What makes the problem worse is that oil and gasoline are among the most \"inelastic\" commodities know to economics.  That means there are virtually no substitutes, except in a few countries like France and Brazil (see below).  When demand exceeds supply, poor people do without, and people who can afford the commodity pay more, in this case much more.<br /><br />Every internal-combustion-engine plant and every car sold anywhere in the world<br />increases the inelasticity of oil and gasoline and exacerbates this problem.  And the world is hell bent on building lots more of both.<br /><br />A rational society would try to solve this problem, rather than arranging things so that oil producers experience an extraordinary windfall for a few years before economic collapse.  France is such a society, with 77% of its electricity from nuclear power and a nationwide network of electrified trains.  Brazil is also, with the world's largest fleet of flex-fuel cars, all burning ethanol derived (renewably) from cane, which is four times less energy-intensive than corn.<br /><br />But we are not a rational society.  Nor is most of the rest of humanity.  With foreign help, China and India are building huge automobile markets, and China's is already the world's biggest.  Our industry is playing a big part.  If you can think of a better way, besides nuclear war, to commit global economic suicide, please let me know.<br /><br />What has this to do with coal, the worst greenhouse-gas polluter?  Plenty.  As oils prices most consumers out of the energy market, the only alternatives will be coal, nuclear, wind and solar, in that order of present use.  Nations with the money or technology to buy or build electric cars will probably run them massively on coal, at least at first.  That, of course, will exacerbate climate change.<br /><br />So the health and perhaps survival of our grandchildren depend on how fast a global transition to nuclear, wind and solar power can be made (perhaps with natural gas as a transition fuel).  Oil is on its way out, regardless of arguments about \"peak oil\" and regardless of anything OPEC can or would do.  It there's a war in the middle east, all this will get much worse much quicker.<br /><br />We no longer matter as much, as China has already surpassed us as the world's worst polluter.  But if our species doesn't collectively get its act together soon, your grandchildren will be living in a very different world by the time they are your age.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://jaydiatribe.blogspot.com/2010/12/four-dollars-gallon-by-next-summer.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://jaydiatribe.blogspot.com...</a><br />", "recommendationCount": 31}, {"assetID": 2238507, "replies": [], "lft": 44, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/science/earth/31epa.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3150773, "rgt": 45, "userDisplayName": "ras", "createDate": "1293768885", "userID": 60559689, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1293772811", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1293772811", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "Risky for the GOP ?

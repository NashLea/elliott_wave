Even in the defensive backfield, NFL players like Ed Reed, Charles Woodson and more recently Charles Tillman have all looked very good after age 30.  (And speaking of the Bears, how about that 34-year-old Brian Urlacher?)  <br/><br/>Also I think players slow down as a function of the wear &amp; tear on their bodies, not just chronological age.  That is why, to me, Troy Polamalu is in some respects an \"old\" 31.  Surely his basic conditioning is still superb.  But, but:  over the years he has been a human highlight reel by constantly pushing the boundaries of what's physically possible, and I think that perhaps that style of play takes its toll ... sometimes even over the course of a single season.  (Note that Troy has played in 3 Super Bowls &amp; has not really had a standout game in any of them.  He maxes himself out getting the team there.)  So maybe the best-case is that this year, he misses the midseason but is wired up for prime time by postseason.  <br/><br/>In general, the Steelers have been phasing out their older stars gradually.  Hines Ward &amp; James Farrior are now gone; this year might be the last for Keisel and some others.  We'll see how the transition goes for the rest of the season, and whether or not a good balance has been struck.

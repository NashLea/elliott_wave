These were PEACE ACTIVISTS, were they not?? There were 5 other boats where nothing of this sort of \"rage reaction\" took place. Why this one? Because they were not peace activists on a humanitarian mission, but rather jihadists looking to beat up and kill Israeli soldiers.

On the other hand, this is just the latest example of the same old story when it comes to treatment of Israel.  The propaganda coming out of the pro-Arab side has really matured in its savviness and its cynical manipulation of world opinion.  They get away with murder in more ways than one.  Because Israel is forced into maintaining maximum muscle power and because they don't have good PR, their enemies play it for all it's worth.  But it's not new.  It does seem more and better though.  How does Hamas get away with killing enemies, denying supplies to non-Hamas members, AND make themselves seem like victims?  This Israel as racist apartheid regime baloney has been repeated so many times, it's become the modern Goebbels effect.   I never know if it's lack of knowledge or hatred that drives some of the comments I read, but it would be nice to see the media, like the NY Times, start doing their job of providing some perspective on both the Middle East stories as well as the rest of the world.", "recommendationCount": 29}, {"assetID": 1535007, "replies": [], "lft": 84, "assetURL": "http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/photographs-of-battered-israeli-commandos-show-new-side-of-raid/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2095529, "rgt": 85, "userDisplayName": "berly1", "createDate": "1275968873", "userID": 1286683, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1275973802", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Denver, CO", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1275970202", "commentSequence": 30, "commentBody": "Never again!", "recommendationCount": 10}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.

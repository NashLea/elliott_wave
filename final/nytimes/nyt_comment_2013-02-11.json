There were numerous problems that I faced in my attempt to finance my college education.  First, I did not attend school in an area of the country where you could get a non-minimum wage job without having a stable schedule.  Second, I did not qualify for non-loan federal aid because my parents started making significant money right before I started college.  Third, state colleges would save me little money due to the scholarships I received at private institutions.<br/><br/>I will freely admit that had I made a couple of changes my debt load would probably be less.  However, there is little to indicate that I could have graduated without any debt or that the debt would be insignificant.  <br/><br/>The people that suffered the most were my intelligent peers that could not get the financing together to finish their education.  I know a number of very intelligent individuals that incurred thousands of dollars in debt but were unable to finish their education due to tuition increases.  I don't have the solution to this problem.  However, if we continue to move forward on this trajectory we will see two groups of bright people.  The first group is buried under crushing student loan debt.  The second is stuck in the lower class because they could not get the education that would allow them to live up to their potential.

In my case, I graduated high school at 16 and entered a prestigious, private university in NYC.  I was from a blue collar family in NYC and the first to attend college.  Tuition was paid through merit scholarships and whatever I could earn from p/t work-study and summer jobs; and I lived at home.  But it was my ambition to become a professional in the health field, and that meant graduate training.  At that point, student loans became a necessity.  My studies as well as the required, unpaid training placements took up so much of my time, I could only manage to work occasionally as an adjunct instructor at night.  Exhaustion was my most constant companion.  Then came repayment of those student loans over 15 years, during which my life choices were severely limited and strained.  <br/><br/>I've spent my career helping others, and yet also paying for that privilege.  It's ironic that in the 1960's, my grandfather, with an 8th grade education, was able to work and save enough to buy a single family home in Queens.

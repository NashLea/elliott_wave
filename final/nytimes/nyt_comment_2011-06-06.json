Both parents work full time, the kids are in school, soccer, etc, and they get a large high energy puppy like a lab, labradoodle, german shepherd, boxer, pit bull, border collie or whatever and expect him to housebreak himself, never chew anything, not require daily exercise and mental stimulation when it's not convenient for the owner (which is never, once the puppy novelty wears off).  Not being able to afford (in time or money) basics like puppy shots, spay/neuter, obedience classes and training, etc, is also a big, big problem. Not taking the time to socialize and train puppies results in a huge number of behavior problems, especially timidity and fear aggression, leading to unwanted and abandoned dogs.  No one wants to walk or live with a big, untrained, unmannered dog, no matter how cute he was as a puppy, so he spends his entire life banished to the back yard, unless he's given up at the shelter.  So DON'T go \"just to look\" at advertised puppies unless you intend to come home with one and have made plans to raise and keep him.  DON'T \"rescue\" a puppy from a pet store or puppy mill-- you are just supporting the industry, and they will breed 3 more to sell to suckers like you.  Ever wonder why the cages are so bare and the puppies look so sad at pet stores?  It's so you'll feel sorry for them.  Ever wonder why the puppies are thin, filthy, flea infested and sick at puppy mills?  It's really hard to walk away from them without \"rescuing\" at least one, at an exorbitant cost, without thinking about the time, effort, and yes, money it will take to turn that puppy into a healthy, well socialized, well trained adult you will want to live with and support for the next 15 years.  DON'T get a large breed puppy when your landlord prohibits large breed dogs.  DON'T get a puppy if you're a college student, especially if you're on summer break, unless you are SURE you can provide a home for him (that is, your mother will take him) when your life changes.  If you live in a dorm, it can't be a surprise at the end of summer break that you can't take your pit bull back to school with you.  When you graduate, it can't be a surprise that you have to move to where the jobs are, and you can't afford a place that will allow dogs because you are a new grad-- and that's assuming you can get a job and don't have to move back in with mom and dad.  Speaking of moms and dads, young couples should think about their plans to have kids before they get a dog.  Too often the dog is a \"practice baby\" and goes the way of the shelter when the baby comes along.  In short (too late, I know) getting a dog, especially a puppy, is the start of a 15 year relationship, and it will take time, effort, and money to turn that dog into the pet you dreamed of, and yes, there will be expenses, including vet bills,  along the way.  Good dogs are like good husbands-- they rarely happen without years of training!

Based on my own experience in school, the school bullies do so because they enjoy it.  They enjoy it because they feel no empathy for their victims.  It's probably that simple.  Many don't come from broken homes, or have low self-esteem, or poor diet, or lack of sleep.  No, controlling and beating up others is their \"thing\".  Unless we can somehow rewire their brains to feel empathy, they won't stop. Catching and punishing them just makes them more methodical about not getting caught next time.  The only real \"cure\" I've found which seems to work on bullies is to give them back a taste of their own medicine, times ten.  It still probably doesn't cure the lack of empathy, but it sets up conditioning where bullying makes them physically hurt, and therefore they stop to avoid being physically hurt.  It worked well on the two who were bothering me, once they left the hospital.\r<br/><br/>Now as for sleep deprivation, I'll grant that it is certainly the cause of numerous childhood (and adult) problems, but here again the solution is overly simplistic.  Lack of sleep isn't the problem.  The problem is school schedules which assume everyone is a morning person.  This isn't true.  Some people just will not function well in the morning regardless of how much sleep they've had.  Some just can't fall asleep early enough to be well rested by 7AM because their bodies tell them it's too early to sleep.  These are usually the same people who are difficult to get out of bed at an early hour.  They stay up later because it's natural to their physiology.  My theory is humans are inherently either morning or night people.  The morning people probably descended from those who tended the fields.  The night people were hunters.  Each was perfect in their niche, but horrible in the other.  So my answer is why try to fight nature?  Try instead having kids who seem chronically exhausted put in classes which maybe don't start until early afternoon.  And workplaces should look into doing something similar as it would improve employee productivity.  Speaking from personal experience, it's pure hell being forced to go to school/work on a schedule which doesn't suit your circadian rhythms.  It's like living in a perpetual state of twilight where you go through the motions but don't really experience anything real.  Anyone here who is a morning person, imagine if you were woken at 1 AM and told to start your day.  That's exactly how it is for night people on a regular day schedule.  I could have been so much more had I not been forced to a day schedule.  Only now, working at home for a number of years on my own schedule, do I realize how lousy and unhealthy a conventional schedule was for me personally.

If the transplant surgeon uses the same team, then they probably have the procedures down pat, and also the contigency plans if a complication arises down pat.  They may all be tired, but chances are if one slips up due to fatigue, another team member will notice their mistake.  Now if one person were in charge of the whole show, then that can't happen.  A fatigued bus driver is far less able to safely do their job than a fatigued transplant surgeon.  Even the nature of the work helps.  Surgery is intensely complex, involved work.  Even when tired, it's rare to fall asleep when you need to concentrate.  Driving a bus over a highway is inherently boring.  It can put even a well-rested person to sleep.\r<br/><br/>Sleep deprivation may affect judgment calls, but with set procedures in place, once the operation is mapped out, I would imagine there isn't much room for judgement.  In an ideal world, we would have more surgeons.  In the real world, given the dedication required relative to the financial rewards society is willing to give surgeons, this doesn't seem likely anytime soon.  The only long term hope might be robots programmed by master surgeons, but that's probably decades away.

This article is scientific like I'm the president of the United States. I actually registered just to comment on this, I was so annoyed. Mr. Leonhardt, I hope for your sake you're not an economist, since that would not say good things about economics as a discipline. I mean, duh! The world is not the same today as it was in 1939, surprise surprise. So many things are different: the population (which you completely failed to take into account) is vastly different; people's habits are different; prices of food, labor, and pretty much everything else are different. Sorry, adjusting for inflation just won't cut it! (Pray tell, what was the price of, say, an iPod, back in 1939?) The conclusion, unfortunately, is that at least in the strict logical sense (I am a mathematician so I care about such silly things like logic), there is no \"magic formula\" to \"adjust\" for all the different things that have changed in the world over such a time. What you economists (I'll assume for the sake of argument you're one) call adjusting for inflation is based on the average price changes for a basket of various \"standardized\" goods like a sack of rice or I don't know what else. The relevance of this measure of inflation to the discussion about how popular of a movie Avatar is compared to Gone With the Wind is precisely zero. Of course, the question about which of these two movies has had a larger influence on human culture and society is quite an interesting one. But hey, GWTW has been around for 70 years! Come back in another 70 years and let's see how Avatar is doing, alright? And in the meantime, as someone said: Avatar is the highest grossing movie - deal with it! It may not mean as much as some people think it means, but at least it has the very real advantage of being TRUE.", "recommendationCount": 1}, {"assetID": 1212401, "replies": [], "lft": 30, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/underemployment-state-by-state/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1638363, "rgt": 31, "userDisplayName": "AnnS", "createDate": "1267504758", "userID": 43069609, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267506541", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "MI", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267506541", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "(1)   12.Tom with the Like our neighbor's wife who gave up looking for jobs when the baby was born, the construction worker down the street who is part time until the snow drifts melt and the ice goes out on the lakes, the part time college worker who would assumes they are entitled to work full time, and the just plain lazy, there are always statistics without context or clearly stated assumptions<br /><br />__<br /><br />No the problem is people who have access to a keyboard but are clueless about the mehtodology of counting the unemployed or underemployed. Let's take your list:<br /><br />(a) Like our neighbor's wife who gave up looking for jobs when the baby was born,<br /><br />She is not counted in either the U-3 (unemployed) or the U-6 (unemployed, discouraged, part-time but want full-time etc.)<br /><br />She is counted as \"not in the labor market at all\" Thus she is not in the data above.<br /><br />(b) the construction worker down the street who is part time until the snow drifts melt<br /><br />He is counted as employed as does not show up in the U-3 at all.<br /><br />He will show up in the U-6 as part-time wanting to be full-time IF AND ONLY IF he has been applying for full-time jobs in the past month.<br /><br />He will not be counted as 'discouraged\" (wants job but not applied for one in the past month) because he has a job.<br /><br />(c) the part time college worker who would assumes they are entitled to work full time,<br /><br />See above. Only counted in the U-6 as a part-time wants full-time if they have been appling for full-time jobs all along.<br /><br />There is PLENTY OF CONTEXT and CLEARLY STATED ASSUMPTIONS in analyzing the unemployment data. One just has to be able to look up the methodolgy and find and read the questions ask on the household survey - and most importantly of all, be able to UNDERSTAND things not in soundbites for the ignorant.<br /><br /> Of course that means having  more common sense than a gnat and not just thinking that the only information necessary to understand the world, the economy and the society is what you \"know\" from your narrow little world and tiny little circle of acquaintances.    Only a fool would assume that everything is the same everywhere as it is in their little neighborhood and world of upper 25% incomes.<br /><br />FOr those who don't understand that they and their world are not the only standard for reality, try reading the Northeastern Univ study on how unemployment has affected households at different income levels.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.clms.neu.edu/publication/documents/Labor_Underutilization_Problems_of_U.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.clms.neu.edu...</a><br /><br />(2) 13.marlyn<br /><br />5:22 pmI was surprised to see high numbers for California and they match Michigan!!...these two states need Governors/Mayors etc.. that can attract new business..leaders who have entrepreneurship experience and ideas<br /><br />___<br /><br />Blah blah blah.....opinions and no knowledge.<br /><br />(a) Michigan's high U-6 is caused by unemployed (collapse of long-standing highly technical industries like auto engineering and high tech manufacturing for autos) and a relatively equal pslit between the (i) want full-time only get part-time because of cuts in hours of work and (ii) discouraged workers who are unemployed, want a job but haven't applied for one in the past month largely because they have run out of jobs to apply for<br /><br />(b) California's high U-6 comes from the unemployed and largely the want full-time only get part-time (WFTOGPT) workers rather than an equal distribution between WFTOGPT and discouraged.  California's U-6 is climbing because of the cuts in HOURS of workers and the furloughs during work weeks.<br /><br />Not gonna solve that unless businesses get more customers.<br /><br />In fact it doesn't matter how many great ideas people have for more restaurants, more massage parlors, and more frou-frou nonsense in general because households DO NOT HAVE ANY MONEY TO SPEND.   The issue isn't an 'idea' - it is not having enough customers who can afford the products and services.<br /><br />ANd that is true nationally. And it won't change unless and until someone comes up with some product that be widely made in the US and hugely in demand in the world.  Can't go along peddling each other junk from China and 'consulting services' and massages and dogwalking and 'home interior' when as a nation you don't produce goods to which you add value by creating them.", "recommendationCount": 4}, {"assetID": 1211081, "replies": [], "lft": 32, "assetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/will-underwater-homeowners-make-waves/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1638444, "rgt": 33, "userDisplayName": "AnnS", "createDate": "1267506383", "userID": 43069609, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1267506577", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "MI", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1267506577", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "5.Disappointed<br />France<br />March 1st, 2010<br />10:21 amMs Folbre is obviously no expert on corporation law. The analogy between a corporation going bankrupt and an individual going bankrupt because his house is underwater is seriously flawed. Here's why. Many if not most of the individuals who are now in trouble due to the bad housing market put very little or no equity into their homes.<br /><br />_<br /><br />The old (and wrong) 'they are defauting because they didn't have enough downpayment (equity) in the property.<br /><br />Yep, the owners who are walking away from a house here didn't have enough'equity.\" They put down  $500,000. The mortgage was $2,000,000.   It has been on the market for  2 1/2 years.<br /><br />It started at $3,200,000 in late 2007. (Stupid realtor thought is had gained in value since 2005.)<br /><br />Went to $2,100,000 in late winter/early spring 2008.<br /><br />June/July 2009 it dropped to $999,999 (with the agreement of the bank to that list and saying the lender would consider any offer.)<br /><br />The borrowers finally said 'to hell with it\". It goes to foreclosure sale next week.<br /><br />Yep. Those borrowers just didn't have enough 'equity' in the place with only 20% down or $500,000.    If they had had 'equity' when they bought it, they wouldn't have walked. LOL!!!<br /><br />Look when prices have fallen over 25 -35% on average, very very very few buyers who haven't owned the house for 5 years or more are going to have that kind of 'equity.'<br /><br />And the bottom line is even if they had put down 20, 25, 30 , 35 and - in many parts of California and Nevada and FLorida, 40 or 50% or more - they would STILL be underwater or out every single penny the invested and which they won't see again for 15 -30 years!<br /><br />__<br /><br />And #14 Brett B?   So WHAT if they are 'underwater'?  They are a MINORITY IN THE US. Do the math.<br /><br />64-65% of the US own a house and 35% rent.<br /><br />Of the 64-65% that are homeowners. around 35% do NOT not have a mortgage. That means 42.25% of the US has a mortgage. (65% own homes x 65% of owners with mortgage = 42.25%.)<br /><br />Of all mortgages, around 20-25% are underwater.   42,25% (households with a mortgage) x 25% = 10.56% of US Households are underwater on their mortgages.<br /><br /> 10-11% of ALL US households aare underwater on a mortgage.  And you think the other 89.5% of us should GIVE THEM THE MONEY??!!!!! ROFLOL!!!<br /><br />Hey my car is worth less than I paid for it.  So it my laptop. So is my RV.  So give me the money to make up the difference too!<br /><br />And BTW, my banks are not in trouble at all with mortgage loans. They have a .(point) 95% - 1.25% default rate on their loans. Of course they didn't make stupid lonas on inflated prices to anyone who could fog a mirror.<br /><br />And why on earth would we want to STOP house prices from falling when they went up at the speed of light and household incomes stayed flat or fell?  The relationship between house prices and household incomes is a pretty strong rule - a lot like gravity.  What went up must come down if there is nothing there to support it. And incomes stopped being able to pay the inflated prices you realtors adore about 10-15 years ago.<br /><br />Prices must fall because households can NOT afford them.   If buyers can't afford the price, then to sell all of an item, lower the price.  As Jim the Realtor (linked by Calculated Risk) says \"Nothing price won't fix\"<br /><br />I do think people should be able to file for bankruptcy reorganization (not liquidation) and cram down the mortgage on their primary home to current value. Its only fair since they already can, in bankruptcy reorganization, cram down their second home, their car, their boat, their RV, their rental properties, their commercial real estate, their plane.........  And if they want to reduce the principal that badly, they can take the credit hit of a bankruptcy.

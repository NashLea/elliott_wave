First of all it's not a cheap hotel. The inside of the hotel is beautiful and very elegant, like 4 star hotels. He staff was friendly and helpful - the only problem was that they promised a free taxi transport to the airport in case of 5 nights stay, but I had to ask it more times, they didn't want to give it... I think we received the worst room (No 302) in the hotel, directly under the restaurant and the kitchen, so it was VERY noisy at night and at early dawn too, we couldn't sleep for 5 nights... The room was very elegant and comfortable, the only problem was the terrible view from our window (see pictures)... The air conditioner is strange, when you turn it on, it's frozen, but if you don't use it, it's very hot in the room. The restaurant is nice and the breakfast was good. The entire hotel is very clean! But the outside of the hotel is very dirty, the neighborhood is bad... The hotel is about 1 km from the main attractions, but there are so many other hotels that are closer to the monuments. I recommend everybody to eat at the hotel, because the food is good and there are reasonable prices, but the restaurants near the hotel are expensive and disgusting... I think this hotel is too overestimated in these reviews, for this price I would expect more from a hotel, not enough to be elegant inside. But first and last I recommend it.FOUR tips I have for people staying at the \u0130STANBUL OLD C\u0130TY HOTELS<br />1: From airport don't get taxi or shuttle bus, which can cost up to 20euros. Get the metro (M1) to Zeytinburnu, about 6 stops. All trams and transport uses tokens, which costs 1.5 Turkish liras, and you can get this at every station via the vending machines. At Zeytinburnu, change to tram for sultanahmet<br />2: Don't have dinner in the area round the hotel. All the restaurants serves the same foods and charges about the same money. Instead, eat up in Taksim, which you get to by the same tram you came in on, across the bridge. Up there, where all the night clubs/bars/shopping are, you\u2019ll find a better choice of foods, much better atmosphere and here's the important thing, usually 1/3 to up to 1/2 the price you pay in the restaurants round the hotel<br />3:Single girls traveling alone will likely get a lot of male attention. It's usually quite harmless--I never felt harassed by it--but it can be a nuisance.<br /><br />One way to limit this is to buy or borrow a wedding ring, which will cut down on the requests for dinner or a drink or a walk in the park. Some guys can get overly touchy-feely, like the owner of a carpet store just outside the Arasta Bazaar who decided to whisk me into his store. A lot of them call your attention solely for the purpose of making a sale, of course, but *some* of them can get overly familiar.<br />4: Be careful walking around late at night, too. The police may sometimes question people out late at night and this can be quite a scare.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1599622, "replies": [], "lft": 196, "assetURL": "http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/world-cup-live-argentina-vs-mexico/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2186962, "rgt": 197, "userDisplayName": "Roberto M.", "createDate": "1277698166", "userID": 17098468, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1277700895", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1277697295", "commentSequence": 85, "commentBody": "The truth is neither team showed much \"jogo bonito\".

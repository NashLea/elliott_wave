Good essay by Mr. Rattner as well.<br/><br/>The IRS has the legal basis to charge Apple, Mr. Cook, other executives and the Apple board of directors criminally liable for tax evasion. <br/><br/>Fraudulent transfer pricing for the purpose of evading taxes is just that fraudulent, where there is no economic or business basis for the tax accounting. The sole purpose - not only that but the purpose could not be any more glaringly obvious - is to evade income taxation in the USA. That is a crime, particularly given the amounts involved.<br/><br/>If the Obama Administration had some slight courage, it would instruct the IRS to indict Apple, Mr. Cook, the CFO, the head of taxes there and the entire board of directors as criminals. That action alone would change the tune of other companies engaging in the same activity.<br/><br/>At the same time the Obama Administration should put massive pressure of any and all kinds on the Irish government that will cost it much more than continuing to act as a partner in crime to these companies.

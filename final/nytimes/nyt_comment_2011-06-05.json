Grow up.  Seriously.  The success or failure of a franchise is dependent on so many factors.  What didn't work for the North Stars has been changed for the Wild (an old arena in Bloomington vs a new one in St. Paul, for example.)   Even hockey-mad Canada has almost lost the Flames, the Oilers, and the Senators in recent years. It was Bettman that created the Canadian Assistance Plan that kept Canadian teams afloat.  Caps owner Ted Leonsis recalled, \u2018I remember having to pay corporate welfare to help Canadian clubs in the N.H.L. under the banner of an assistance program. I remember a broker coming to me to sell the Montreal Canadiens on the cheap. The book was being sent around via e-mail to buy the team and an American bought it for a song. That was not long ago.\u2019  2) Bettman has said on many occasions that moving a franchise was a \"last resort\"; if a deal can be struck to keep the Phoenix franchise from moving, that's consistent with his previous statements. Calling it \"desperation\" just makes you sound bitter.  3) to say that Winnipeggers got back a team \"they should arguably have never lost in the first place\" is just plain ignorant.  There was no one willing to buy the team _and_ keep the team in Winnipeg.  There was no salary cap to fix player costs, which were spiraling upward.  The Canadian dollar was worth about 65 cents in the US.  Player contracts often insisted on payment in US Dollars.  But...times have changed.  I'm very happy for Winnipeg (and curious what the name of the team will be.)  And I agree -- \"Bettman will never be a revered character in Canada\" but it's mostly because of Canadians who give him too much blame when things go wrong, and no credit for all the things that he's done right in support of Canadian teams.

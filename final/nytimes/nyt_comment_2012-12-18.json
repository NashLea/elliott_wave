Senator Feinstein's landmark bill on banning assault weapons was watered down over time and finally allowed to expire. Some Americans have protected their guns gun rights by misinforming the public, changing the meaning of the law to suit their views - anything as long as any and all weapons can still be sold. Then, when our African-American president was elected, gun sales went through the roof. They went through the roof again when he was reelected. That, however, has absolutely nothing to do with what happened on Friday, except for the little we know of Adam Lanza's mother and her affinity for weapons.<br/><br/>When Gabby Giffords was shot and President Obama gave his speech, I am sure he was sincere. But where were Gabby's colleagues then? Where have they been since?<br/><br/>What we know, today, is that almost all of the candidates supported by the NRA this election lost their bid for office. That's good. What we also know is that, finally, some of the staunchest defenders of the gun lobby are coming forward, one by one, and repudiating the NRA. That's excellent.<br/><br/>I've been calling for President Obama, if need be, to tell Speaker Boehner he won't sign any Fiscal Cliff bill unless he's presented with a real gun control bill.

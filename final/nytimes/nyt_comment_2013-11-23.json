Consumers have all of the info they need to make an educated buying decision, invoice prices on new cars and fair market value on used cars are easily accessible on sites like <a href=\"http://nada.com\" title=\"nada.com\" target=\"_blank\">nada.com</a> or <a href=\"http://kbb.com\" title=\"kbb.com\" target=\"_blank\">kbb.com</a> etc. In many instances dealers  are not even allowed to mark up subprime loans, and on the good credit customers dealers are paid a flat fee for arranging the financing and doing the paperwork instead of the bank.  Marking up interest rates is almost a practice of the past, many dealers with myself included prefer to be paid a flat fee because marking up the rate subjects the dealer to the possibility of chargeback by he lender for unearned income due to a customer paying off the loan early which is almost inevitable since most people trade in their vehicles every 3 to 4 years! So marking up the rate is not real income until the customer makes all of their scheduled payments.To sum up, do your research and have multiple options, dealers actually appreciate a consumer that knows what they want and one that have done their research.", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 3388240, "replies": [], "lft": 48, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/opinion/nocera-obamas-bay-of-pigs.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 10589275, "rgt": 49, "userDisplayName": "Josy Will", "createDate": "1385183209", "userID": 56781528, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1385183226", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Eau Claire", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1385183226", "commentSequence": 10589275, "commentBody": "Nocera, if you know the history of the ACA, you have to take into account its fate in the court system and the overwhelming opposition from its opponents. We are talking folks who were willing to shut down the US government on account of a healthcare law.<br/><br/>This law was written to set up state exchanges for health insurance. Indeed states that have their own exchanges are not experiencing nearly as much headache as <a href=\"http://healthcare.gov\" title=\"healthcare.gov\" target=\"_blank\">healthcare.gov</a> is. Kentucky, California, Colorado have reported success. For states that have no exchanges, the Feds recruited navigators to help with the sign up. But those navigators have been fought and practically run out of states like Florida. In addition, states are taking longer to let the Feds know whether or not they will (a) accept Medicare expansion, and (b) set up exchanges.

Many Jewish and/or Canadian poets are being cited in this thread!<br/><br/>Speaking of poets, as you did re Leonard Cohen: Lou Reed's career was heavily influenced by one (Delmore Schwartz, at the elite Syracuse University) as well; then later Patti Smith. Having said that, I can see other similarities between he and L. Cohen, which I won't go O.T. with.<br/><br/>An email from my cousin who blogs about music informs me that his son's good friend goes to Lou Reed's old HS.  School has a photo up of Reed, who was on the track team in addition to being a paid musician.  By all accounts, he was happy on LI and in HS; he even moved back in with his parents for a bit after a couple of velvety underground years.<br/><br/>It is altogether fitting that I mentioned Canadians in my C-I-C, because Fred Healy is from your home and naturalized land (see 11D, \"BC\").<br/><br/>Perhaps his British Columbianality will evoke comment from Robert and Elke (who, it just occurred to me, are lucky to perhaps fit comfortably in some of the better known low-slung FAST CARs?).<br/><br/>Mash-up of the BC comic and CS Lewis would get us to the BCS, hated by college-football fans.

This isn't so, almost no new coal-fired plants are being built.  New plants in the US are going to natural gas because it is cheap and clean, and older plants are starting to retrofit to burn it.<br/><br/>New coal-fired plants are still being built at high rates in China, and rather distressingly Europe is seeing a return to coal-fired plants as nuclear plants are being shut down post Chernobyl, post Fukushima.  <br/><br/>A critical first step is to stop exporting coal -- the US needs to stop, we need to convince Australia, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa to stop too.  It is CRAZY for America to ship coal to China, so they can use it to destroy our economy and the planet. <br/><br/>These plants could be avoided, and may be converted to natural gas in the future, as \"fracking\" production techniques become widely used.

This very large reduction comes from the combination of the lower carbon content of methane and the very high efficiency of the combined-cycle plant (which does have higher capital cost).  <br/><br/>All this being said, yes of course it will take major international agreements and all nations will need to take serious steps to reduce CO2 emissions.

By the end of this year we will have ended the two wars that added trillions to the debt.  Therefore, the defense budget needs to go back to pre-war levels.  The economy needs to be revived, resulting in more tax revenues and fewer expenditures in the form of unemployment benefits and Medicaid/SNAP payments.  All the Bush tax cuts need to eventually end.

The inflation hawks are wrong at a more fundamental level. Their incorrect assumption is that monetary inflation is a bad thing. Within reason, it is merely neutral, as a decline in the value of green slips of paper or 0's and 1's in the bank affects all prices, including wages. While there are some second order effects, and particular groups of people may have speculative bets about the future inflation rate, the effects of monetary inflation are minimal.<br/><br/>Monetary inflation can be contrasted with real inflation that occurs when the cost of particular goods or services rise due to negative supply shocks. This case, unlike monetary inflation, represents a real loss of wealth and is a negative. This, however, has nothing to do with money printing, but rather real-world events.<br/><br/>So not only are the inflationistas wrong in their prediction that inflation will happen, they are wrong in assuming that it would be a substantial negative even if it did. Well, not completely wrong, as it would be bad for bankers (who have made a lot of bets that inflation will be low), and a disproportionate number of bankers are to be found among the inflationista crowd...

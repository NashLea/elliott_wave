Through college and later, I spent probably 40 nights at Tek's house in all seasons and different conditions of life.  While my parents weren't paying tuition to HM and he had no formal pedagogic authority over me, the relationship was clearly one of teacher-student, including elements of impressionability and emotional vulnerability.  I was at that time regularly approached by gays which presumably demonstrated some desirability to that orientation.<br/><br/>Tek Young Lin's conduct was at all times and in all lights absolutely impeccable, humane, and beyond reproach without any trace of sexual manipulation or impropriety.  Nor was there any sexual contact.  Having attended 3 ultra-elite universities over 9 years, I'd vouch that Tek's a singularly gifted teacher and life instructor with insights and experiences that one would be hard pressed to find in the arid, self-serving, and spineless ecosystems of most higher education.  His stories of his HM students whom I never met provided fully persuasive evidence of his concern for their well-being and development.  My life was enriched by the \"serendipity\" of our initial encounter.<br/><br/>To spare the knee-jerk reaction of other commentators, to any coherent mind, this testimony in no way transmutes or re-characterizes the facts alleged in the article.

Obama should turn his back on Romney and focus on defeating the worst of the neo-GOP Congressmen. Each time he flips a district from \"safe neo-GOP incumbent\" to \"probably Democratic challenger\", he will have at least two effects. One is that Rove will have to pour some black money into the district, which may be too visible on such a small scale.

As such, I believe you've missed the point.<br/><br/>The context here is not whether \"adults in power relationships over children\" are inherently coercive (a matter not in dispute), but whether/ how the power and coercion held by priests differs from the power and coercion held by teachers (and whether due to that difference or other reader biases, the NYT readers' reactions have differed).<br/><br/>My second sentence should make clear that (in response to Brenda Becker), people's reactions to the different circumstances of priest-parishioner and teacher-student sexual abuse may relate to the \"fuzzy\" difference (i.e., different by matters of degree) between the powers inherent in the two professions and whether students feel they have recourse to safely avoid and report their abuser.<br/><br/>I agree that adults are almost always in power relationships over children. Further, that sexual relationships and sexual favors should be forbidden between those with grossly inequal power, as the nature of the coercion may be inescapable and irrefutable.

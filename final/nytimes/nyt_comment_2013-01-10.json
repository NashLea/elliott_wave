From this it must follow that, upon the lawful arrest of the holder of a gun permit for driving while intoxicated, the evidence supporting the arrest is a sufficient predicate for the temporary suspension of the permit. <br/><br/>     A statute providing for such a suspension, whether compelled or left to the discretion of the court, diminishes the risk of death or injury by defendant\u2019s use of his gun, a defendant  who ordinarily is unknown to the court and whose conduct suggests that the defendant may be troubled and may have an impaired judgment. Further, delay will infuse itself into the action. The consequences of a finding of guilt are substantial and rare is the defendant who yearns for a speedy disposition. His attorney will inquire into every factual and legal test available to the defendant. In short, unless there is a suspension of the gun permit and a handing over of the gun to the police, the risks attending  defendant\u2019s continued possession of his gun are increasedby the inevitable delay.<br/><br/>Respectfully, the Governor should consider a bill providing for the suspension of a gun permit during the pendency of an action for driving while intoxicated.

They needed temporary hospitals and isolation wards then, and building them should have started then.

Why did the CDC say there was a protocol for treatment that should have been used at the Texas Presbyterian Hosp. when in fact, as a national nurses union has complained, there was no such protocol delivered to nurses or to hospitals?

MLB, in its eternal quest for every last dollar, has damaged their product to the extent that most people choose to no longer watch it.  The changing demographics of the U.S. was not mentioned in the article.  Interleague play is common and occurs almost every day.  The World Series was special in large part because the two leagues never played each other in any games that counted.  Because MLB wanted the temporary infusion of money from Yankees-Mets, Cubs-White Sox, and Dodgers-Angels, it really cheapened the World Series.  MLB has also allowed the networks to pack extra commercials into games that are already too slow in terms of pace and too long in terms of time.  Go to youtube and watch a World Series game from the 1950's.  It's hardly the same game.  MLB has also lost a whole generation of younger fans with a couple decades worth of late starting times.  These people are not coming back.  MLB has been reaping lots of cash rewards from local cable companies and stations desperate to fill programming hours with live sports because live sports are about the only events that are DVR proof these days.

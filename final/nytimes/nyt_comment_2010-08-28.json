Your logic is appalling. First and foremost, it assumes that ALL Hutus perpetrated the genocide, including the children who weren't alive during it. Are you suggesting that Tutsi lives are more valuable than Hutu because they were victims of genocide? I think you miss the point entirely.<br />First of all, genocide isn't being used as a \"political\" term here; it fits the UN definition in that one group killed another with the intent to destroy them as such...simply because they were Hutu. And if it's not genocide, fine. That doesn't make it right.<br />So second, the point is that despite all of our \"never agains\" after what happened in Rwanda in 1994, it's happening again. It has been happening. The war in Africa is termed by many as WWIII. And in its totality, has killed more people than WWI or WWII. Mass killing is never ok. And to what end? On one hand, Rwanda is repatriating Hutus and on the other, \"Rwanda\" slaughters Hutu. We should be asking if indeed the Rwandan government, and Paul Kagame, are behind orders to kill Hutu. We should be asking why, if Rwanda is not behind this they have not done more to stop the killing. We should be asking WHO benefits from the natural resources and trace the trails back to leaders across Africa. And we should be asking WHO in the Western world benefits from continuing war. Finally, we should be asking why we ever vowed \"never again.\"<br /><br />Hutu, Tutsi...I don't care. HUMAN. That's all that matters. We should be united in our common humanity to see beyond tribe, race, ethnicity, gender, religion...and to recognize the inherent value in a human life. That's the point. We said never again. It doesn't need to be called genocide to be WRONG.

Glen Beck is exhorting exactly the opposite idea. The only thing that will live on in Beck's legacy will be the millions Rupert Murdoch is paying him.<br /><br />Dr. King gave another speech December 18, 1963, at Western Michigan University. One of his comments was, \"We must all learn to live together as brothers or we will perish together as fools.\"<br /><br />Dr. King was a Biblical scholar. That comment can be traced back to the Book of Exodus. Scouts were sent into the \"promised land.\" They were afraid so they came back with frightful, fear-filled stories. What happened? Because they were unwilling to face their fears and learn the truth, the entire generation was forced to wander and die in the wilderness. They were not allowed enter the promised land.<br /><br />Dr. King was describing our fate if we don't change. If we don't overcome our fears, learn the truth that we're all equal as humans, and learn to live together in peace and cooperation, we, too, will fail to enter our desired promised land that exists in our hearts regardless of religion. And, Mr. Beck?  He is exhorting Americans to take path to expending their lives wandering in a human wasteland.<br /><br />In terms of fire hoses and dogs, wow. Sounds like Mr. Beck is appealing to those who want to be heroic victims. Do people really want to feel they are significant through hating? Do they think being jabbed with a high-voltage cattle prod is an adventure? Strange.<br /><br />President Obama uses the name Barak because that's the name his parents gave him, just as Mr. Beck's parents named him Glen and I have the name Liam. In the Book of Judges, Barak is the commander of Deborah's army and a hero in the fight to defeat the Canaanites. In Hebrew, Tiberian, and Arabic, Barak means lightning. That's a pretty cool name implying strength and quick, decisive action. Why would anyone want to give up a historically significant name with a cool meaning? In Gaelic, Liam means strong protector. I think that's cool, too; I like the implication for my life and have never entertained giving it up, even if it is rather rare in the U.S. (but not the UK.)<br /><br />Glen is also Gaelic. The Welsh side of the word means clean or purity - referring to rivers. Mr. Beck isn't doing too good a job living up to his name. Maybe he'd prefer an authentic American name such as Hakadah, Santee Sioux meaning \"the pitiful last.\" Hopefully Mr. Beck is the pitiful last of these dishonorable, flag-wrapped racists.<br /><br />Mr. Beck is big on talking about the Christian people in America. That would include the Bible, wouldn't it? Barak is an honorable name right out of the Bible. Maybe Glen Beck needs less flapping of the jaws and more reading of his Bible. Or, better yet, since he probably wouldn't understand the insights, maybe he should just study and reflect on the story of the Rev. John Newton, former slave ship captain, who wrote Amazing Grace.<br /> ", "recommendationCount": 978}, {"assetID": 1792834, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/opinion/28blow.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2459432, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Deborah", "createDate": "1282962003", "userID": 28930886, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1282969626", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Baltimore", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1282966026", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "The silence of the pundits about the Glen Beck travesty has made me sadder than I can say.

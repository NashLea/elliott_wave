Half of India's population is less than 25 years old; all were born even after the government's overt attempts to educate (and often force) people to not have too many kids.  Reproduction is about the only thing within the control of half of Indians - and boy do they exercise that right.  <br/><br/>More spending is unlikely to help.  Currently, about 80% of all government spending goes into graft and corruption.  The government collects all kinds of money from sales and production taxes, and then shares it with a few, close knit community of politicians, their supplicants, and industrialists.  After that, it is a government dedicated to keeping people poor, disaffected, illiterate, and miserable.  Prices of apartments in Bombay rival those in NY City, in a country that produces about one 25th the wealth per capita as the US.  Well, a handful of people have all the money.<br/><br/>There are no solutions here except shock therapy.  The market must become completely open, the government regulations must be eliminated, and the vast bureaucracy that exists to suck the life out of people should be eliminated - immediately.  Too many low lever government employees have the power to stop economic activity, and expect a bribe.

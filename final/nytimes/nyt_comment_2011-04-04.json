In the case of Michele Bachmann that's far right. If she is convinced that her ideas are best for this country then she SHOULD run for president. The American people can decide for themselves (or in this case Republican primary voters) if she's worthy of leading this great nation. We don't need the press to tell us what to think. I personally think she would have a difficult time winning over any Democrats and few Independents in a general election. However she will push the eventual Republican nominee farther to the right.  Ultimately, Republicans will have to field a candidate that appeals to a wide electorate if they want to win votes from moderate Democrats and Independents. This is unlikely with Michele Bachmann on the ticket.", "recommendationCount": 56}]}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved."}

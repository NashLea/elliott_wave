Historian Stuart Brandes, an expert on war profiteering in American history, admits there were numerous problems with the early Brooks Brothers uniform contracts but justly concludes that, while they caused \u201cmuch embarrassment to New Yorkers,\u201d they did \u201cno significant damage to the war effort.\u201d He adds that \u201cthe matter hardly deserved the notoriety it received.\u201d<br/><br/>Like shoe factories in Gettysburg and other Civil War myths, the illusion of Brooks Brothers as the archetypal Civil War profiteer endures: one recent biographer of Boss Tweed and his Tammany Hall machine states matter-of-factly (and incorrectly) that \u201cnone less than Brooks Brothers supplied twelve thousand sets of uniforms early in the war using \u2018shoddy\u2019 \u2014 ground up rags \u2014 that fell apart after a few days.\u201d \\<br/><br/>Perhaps the illusion endures because Brooks Brothers itself endures, but if it does it is for lack of facts, perspective, and historical context.<br/><br/>The fact is that only a fraction of the uniforms that Brooks Brothers supplied were made from (admittedly) substandard material and had to be replaced (at Brooks Brothers\u2019 expense). In terms of perspective, Brooks Brothers can hardly be thought of as a chronic profiteer: apart from a few more contracts to supply the New York militia, it never became one of the premier suppliers to the Union Army. The historical context is also important. In the years between the world wars, the Army\u2019s quartermasters still complained of the vagaries of supplying a large army with uniforms and pointed to the very problems that had plagued Brooks Brothers in the Civil War: securing large lots of uniform cloth of uniform color of durable fabric suitable for the rigors of campaign.<br/><br/>See:<br/><br/>Brandes, S.

The South's economy depended on slavery because there was no inflation in the mid-1800s.  Because the northern states' economies were based on industry and small-scale farming the economy was growing faster than their debts.  And the economy was growing faster than the supply of new silver and gold. That  increased the value of the dollar and forced price deflation. <br/><br/>The Southern economy relied on debt to fuel large-scale agriculture investments, and agricultural productivity did not grow with the size of the economy.  Price deflation caused by the industrial revolution in the North raised the value of debts, lowered the value of land and other assets, and put constant downward pressure on crop prices.  The only way out was to get more free labor--and more free land.  This is why the expansion of slavery into the West was the single great divisive issue, from 1820 onward.  This is why southern aristocrats dreamed of taking over Mexico and Cuba.  This is why the North's refusal to expand slavery into new states infuriated the South.  This issue of debts, deflation and metal money was the underlying reason why the South refused to abandon slavery. It even made its way into Thomas Jefferson's original draft of the Declaration of Independence: he blames the King of England for slavery, because the King's banks would not allow inflation, which locked large-scale slaveowners into constant and increasing indebtedness.<br/><br/>If the United States had instituted paper money and a steady increase in the money supply matching the growth of the economy, it would have provided Southern slaveholders with a pathway out of debt, and a possibility of escaping the economic trap of slavery, without losing their land or their economic status.  <br/><br/>But the North probably preferred war to inflation. And the huge population of slaves would have still caused a social and political crisis, starting with assertions by former slaves who were children of white men that they had a right to share in their fathers' inheritance.  The resulting social conflict around this and many other social issues would have been aggressive and violent. <br/><br/>So slavery made a war of some sort necessary in the end, even if slavery was not the immediate cause or trigger.  The war could have been delayed if the economy had grown much more slowly, for example.  And if the country had allowed inflation it is possible that the war could have taken the form of a multi-decade social conflict instead of an acute crisis, and it's possible that the deaths might have numbered in the thousands instead of the hundreds of thousands.

Aside from a freak knee injury by a player rolling into him, Brady has been pretty darn durable.  Sure, he has had arm issues in the past, but he's played every game outside of the knee issue that he played through last year and seems completely healed.  Unless someone has had chronic injuries that repeatedly affects season after season, any player is an injury concern.<br /><br />As for Brady's \"motivation\", did Brady become Vincent Jackson?  I don't think anyone needs to question Brady's motivation ever.  How is he less motivated then any of the other QB's you mention (or less durable then someone like Schaub, who has played one full season since starting)?  I agree that his weapons are in question, Brady is not going to hit 50 TDs anytime soon, and he may not even be worth a 4th round pick, but I think beyond the question of his teammates, the other risks are off the mark.  I also think that after the QBs you metnioned going before Brady, only Rivers and Schaub (and Favre, but he looks like he may actually be done) are the QBs who actually have Brady-esque upside.  After them, there is a huge drop off.  McNabb?  Eli Manning?  Flacco?  No thanks.<br /><br />Steven Jackson, I understand the questions about his injuries and performance last year, but a RB that is going to get 85%+ of the carries for their team has a great deal of value in this RB by committee world we now live in.  I see that an elite WR is of great value as well, but if you were not a S-Jax fan and were picking at #6, maybe going with Gore or Michael Turner makes more sense then going WR there.  There will still be elite WRs in the 2nd round (Roddy White, Miles Austin, Brandon Marshall, or even Reggie Wayne.)  I just think a RB who is the the entire offense for a team (even an awful one) is the rarest and most valuable of positions in fantasy.<br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1713884, "replies": [], "lft": 2, "assetURL": "http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/as-iraq-drawdown-nears-a-soldier-shares-hopes-and-fears/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2345180, "rgt": 3, "userDisplayName": "Daniel", "createDate": "1280871670", "userID": 6542014, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1280909121", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "San Diego", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1280905521", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "It is unfortunate that the current administration hasn't learned the lesson taught time and again when a foreign power attempts \"nation building\" in someone else's nation: they need to do it themselves, in their own way, on their own schedule.<br /><br />Iraq arguably is much, much worse off as a result of the US invasion and occupation.

At the time I thought it  would be interesting to search all the battle events for situations where people were killed and there were 0 wounded and 0 detained  and add up the total deaths for those situations.<br /><br />Since then I've downloaded the full Afghan War Diary  dataset and written a computer script that produces information regarding these matters. (12,234 enemy were killed in circumstances when no wounded and no detained were reported. See above)<br /><br />I can provide the computer script and associated files for anyone interested to check the validity of the above output.  Best would be for others to just write their own code from scratch. The most interesting comparisons are above.  I am struck by the 1 to 7 ratio of killed to wounded for Friendly forces (US and allies) and the difference as far as the enemy is concerned. (15,216 enemy killed, 1,824 enemy wounded. For a seven to one ration, for  15,216 enemy killed, where do the expected approximately 100,000 wounded go?  Why are the ratios so different? )<br /><br />I believe other programmers can replicate these numbers quite easily.<br /><br />I would like clarification why these ratios are so drastically different for US (Friendly) vs Enemy vs Afgan (Host nation) vs Civilians.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 1713884, "replies": [], "lft": 8, "assetURL": "http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/as-iraq-drawdown-nears-a-soldier-shares-hopes-and-fears/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2345404, "rgt": 9, "userDisplayName": "Ladislav Nemec'", "createDate": "1280877556", "userID": 4187964, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1280909220", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "big bear, ca", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1280905620", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "Interesting comments by the Iraqis.

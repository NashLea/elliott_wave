Even my little local newspaper can do that. To say that Henin is succeeding only because of improper multiple voting is ignorant and slanderous. Her success is because there are more people who understand tennis and who appreciate what a gift to tennis Henin was who are taking part. The point at issue is which player, at full health and rest and at the top of their game, would prevail head to head. I stated my reasons in post #6: Henin on clay and hard courts, perhaps Steffi on grass. Henin wins.  (2) What is this in your blog about\" Henin had the best two handed backhand, that is all.\" Are you conducting a serious discussion or just messing around?  (3) Some one else spoke of Steffi hitting flat and with power off of her backhand. I saw many of her matches and never saw that once. I repeat that Steffi's backhand was attackable and that is exactly how Henin would beat her. (4) Someone else belittled Henin at the net. Wrong, she had the speed and the racket control and was excellent at the net, far better than Steffi. Pound Steffi's backhand, then into the net is how Henin would win.  (5) I am heartened by how many in this poll recognize and appreciate Henin's ability, which was truly rare and a thing of beauty. To our loss she pushed herself hard, very hard, and wore herself out, many times during the competitive season and finally to the point that she had to retire. Her achievement came from her hard hard work, but that was also the cause of failures in her body. The disrespect shown in many of these postings flows more from the fact that she was shy, not good copy for the press and the PR guys, a very boyish body and mainly appreciated by people who have played competitive tennis at some level and appreciate what they were seeing when she played.

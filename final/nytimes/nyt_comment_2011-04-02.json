Okay.) <br/><br/>The following quote sums up the struggle of trying to live the values of this school where I was (quite literally) raised (Thank you, Friends, for being there!):<br/><br/>\"We've forgotten that a rich life consists fundamentally of serving others, trying to leave the world a little better than you found it. We need the courage to question the powers that be, the courage to be impatient with evil and patient with people, the courage to fight for social justice.

To live is to wrestle with despair, yet never allow despair to have the last word.\" \u2014Cornel West<br/><br/>I hope we're far along the pendulum swing. And that as a society we will begin to move toward support of a robust middle class - rather than elite schools with base tuitions designed subsidize the have-nots (which is, by the way, *everyone else*!).<br/><br/>That said, my non-Quaker protestant church recently reorganized to create a corporation to transact its business (and protect certain assets from risk); so perhaps the impetus for the story is something of a tempest in a teapot.  (The coop preschool my kids attended a few years ago -- for $200 per month -- often had lower profile versions of this \"discussion\" with the governing body of the Unitarian church where we shared space.)

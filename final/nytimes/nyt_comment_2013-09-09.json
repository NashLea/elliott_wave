But all of them recognized it to be wrong and wanted gradual abolition to avoid social/familial disruption, at least in in their time. Washington's will provided for freeing his slaves after his wife's death. Jefferson had a strangely ambivalent approach to the question, what with his opposition to slave trade and also opposition to manumission law. Owner of many slaves who worked to build his grand estate at Monticello, he allowed two of his mixed-breed children from cohabitation with Sally Hemings to escape rather than freeing them.<br/>Madison was perhaps the one who articulated his moral/practical crisis with some degree of openness (other than of course the untainted John Adams and the Quaker-abolitionist convert Benjamin Franklin), as is evident from his Federalist Papers (No.54), cited by another correspondent here. In a letter to Lafayette (1826) Madison asserted: 'the two races cannot coexist, both free and equal', and suggested the ultimate solution of external colonization. Interestingly, later on Lincoln who, in his 'House Divided' speech, asserted the opposite that the two races could not 'coexist, permanently half free and half slave', also toyed for some time with the idea of colonization in Liberia. But it was Lincoln's master stroke to confiscate, as a military necessity, the so-called elephant, or 'persons held to service' by the 'property-holding' rebels,   ", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 3381662, "replies": [], "lft": 121, "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/ones-whove-got-something-to-lose/", "parentID": 9927468, "commentID": 9927499, "rgt": 122, "userDisplayName": "John", "createDate": "1378699218", "userID": 12857582, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1378699267", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Chicago", "commentType": "userReply", "updateDate": "1378695667", "commentSequence": 1, "commentBody": "Martin, whether it was the worst or the best depends on one's point of view.

Their world is dominated by faith and belief, both of which exist outside the realm of reasoned thought and logic.  Facts truly don't matter to them.  The only thing that matters is to follow the principle, or the belief.  All of the masses of empirical data and rock solid arguments in the world, will not change their beliefs.  Faith is in control.  The reason this happens is that humans are essentially emotional creatures.  We do what satisfies our emotional needs, not what is fair or just, or logical.    <br/><br/>This behavior, for all practical purposes, may have an evil effect, but the practitioners are convinced they are doing God's work.   Those that ran the Inquisition tortured and killed, those that burned witches at the stake, and those that practiced human sacrifice were all convinced they were actually combatting evil for God.<br/><br/>Many readers will reject my argument because they want to believe that people are sophisticated, rational thinking beings.  We are not. Our basic nature is to react, not reason.  All of the advanced degrees from high powered universities that permeate the GOP is proof of that.  GOP beliefs are the enemy of reason.

Nevertheless, I have a strong opinion to express regarding some of the possible components revealed in the media.<br /><br />I unequivocally oppose any subsidies or incentives that would encourage offshore drilling.  As a resident of Sarasota, Florida, I appreciate the beauty and the economic benefits of our beaches.  The current oil spill  off the Louisiana coast threatens all shorelines along the Gulf of Mexico.<br /><br />But the threat doesn\u2019t stop there.  If the oil reaches the Gulf Loop Current, it could make its way through the Florida Straits to the Atlantic Ocean and to the Gulf Stream Current.  We could end up sharing bits of our Gulf catastrophy with the east coast of the U.S.  The BP oil spill, combined with the power of winds and currents should make it obvious that a state\u2019s ability to prevent offshore drilling within 75 miles is no protection at all!<br /><br />Given the inevitable power of the oil companies, I at least urge that no further offshore drilling be considered until those oil companies have provided convincing scientifically sound means of containing any future spills.  Offshore platforms have existed since 1947.

Yesterday in your conversation with David Brooks, you suggested limited terms for Supreme Court Justices. Now you don't seem to think octogenarians should automatically be returned to elected office. I'm with you.<br /><br />The original idea (I'm such an \"originalist\"!) for members of the House of Representatives was that they should be citizen-legislators who had real careers back home & just served their country for a few years -- kinda like the draft, I guess -- before returning to their actual jobs.<br /><br />Sure, Senators were supposed to be solons of sorts, but the Founding Fathers found good reason not to elect them for life (although James Madison originally thought that, too, would be a swell idea). Maybe, before the days when corporations became people -- that is, way last year -- it would have been all right to keep these wise old Byrds (nothing personal, Harry) around till they croaked on the Senate floor. But now the main qualification for public office is the ability to raise funds. Does anybody think a talent for fund-raising is actually proof of legislative ability?<br /><br />For a while there, the U.S. Congress had less turnover than the Soviet Politburo. (Really, it did.) The American people, in their perverse wisdom, have lately decided to change that. Bob Bennett got all teary-eyed when he lost his job at 76. He was pretty much the only one. It isn't that incumbents are necessarily bad. For a Republican (okay, he's a Democrat now), I found Specter sort of lovable in his uniquely irascible way. But I still think Pennsylvanians should give him a chance to spend more time with his great-grandchildren or his dog or whoever. And I would be the first one to propose an earmark for a John McCain Retirement Fund.<br /><br />You old boys are really, really not the only ones capable of running the country.

Change can be cathartic if it's positive, and even moderate change can have a therapeutic effect. But the kind of change being demanded by Teabaggers more often than not seems to require therapy.<br /><br />Bob Bennett, recently ousted in Utah, related the story of voters who wanted him gone because he actually delivered the goods to their state. They saw that as some kind of treason. Another voter decided against him because he didn't \"love the Constitution enough\". No doubt they were referring to specific parts of the Constitution, such as the second and tenth amendments.<br /><br />It remains to be seen whether the Teabaggers offer any solutions other than change because they say so. For now, they are haters in need of a hard target. Until it becomes legal to hunt incumbents they'll have to be satisfied with the occasional victory over the Bob Bennetts.<br /><br />As for some kind of larger plan or anything resembling a thoughtful, coordinated effort at making the country a better place (other than getting rid of all those who don't goose-step along with them), since there doesn't seem to be any such thing in the near future, the rest of us will just have to wait until they crash in burn in all their resplendent hatred and vitriol.<br /><br />One does wonder where all this love of the Constitution was when it was being shredded and routinely defiled by Bush, Cheney, and their merry band of neo-con war criminals.

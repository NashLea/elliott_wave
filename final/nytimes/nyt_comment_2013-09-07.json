President Obama has exacerbated the problem of the pundits and pols characterizing policies supported by the vast majority of the public as \"leftist\".  He has done this in many, many ways.  He has attempted to establish his \"centrist cred\" by attacking the left.  But by attacking the left so virulently, he has not simply portrayed himself to their \"right\", but rather has marginalized, and undermined these centrist positions - thus leaving him no respected, credible, and legitimate \"leftist position\", to use as a counterbalance to prove himself centrist.  This has the effect of moving the perceived \"center\" ever rightward.<br/><br/>President Obama is not alone in moving what is considered among the pundit and pol \"VSP's\" as \"centrist\" ever rightward, but he has a position with great power to inform discussion, and move public opinion, and he has used it very poorly.<br/><br/>Given that the President is extremely smart, it is only logical to assume that this is not an accident, and that his true policy desires are aligned with his policy proposals.  For example, he truly believes cutting SS via chained CPI is good policy, even though 80% of the nation disagrees, and would rather raise FICA taxes than cut SS.

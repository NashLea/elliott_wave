Secondly, the political climate was set to take advantage of the economic climate...GOP'ers, knowing that President Obama didn't have the time to 'fight tooth and nail' with out risk of getting 'nothing' done, pressed against him on every issue.  Not to mention that he never really had a 'true' majority.  Sure, he had a majority of Democrats in number, but many of those Democrats parrot the same tired and proven false talking points(which will no doubt be used to bash my comment at some point) that came from the GOP; which is fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion, even if they're wrong.  Its not their fault...they're just 'doing their jobs'.  Its the electorate's fault.  They voted in these nattering-naybobs of negativity BEFORE President Obama took office.

This is where students, at all levels, go beyond rote book learning, to asking themselves questions and searching for reliable answers.  This is the process of science.  Before you can discover the answer to a question you might pose, one must search out what others have already asked and discovered.  Enormous time is required to do this and evaluate the information, long before one finally arrives back at the original question asked.  Usually one finds that others have already asked, and possibly answered, the original question.  But in just this process, one learns infinitely more than simply reading information out of books.<br /><br />Moreover, one always ends up going far beyond the original question in reading and discovering what others have done and seeking to evaluate the quality of what they have done.<br /><br />Most high school environments are not set up to accomplish such tasks at all.  The teachers there are already way overburdened as it is.<br /><br />The system of teaching science must receive major surgery if we are to compete with some other serious countries today.  For example, we are all bombarded with repeated, over and over and over again, results of relatively trivial sports entertainment propaganda at every broadcast, radio, television, newspaper, etc., but nothing about science and mathematics.  How about a little equal time?  There are more significant and enlightening areas of human endeavor than just sports entertainment all day long, sex and violence from the Hollywood Perverts.<br />We spend far too much time on memorizing the names of things or diseases, or objects or concepts, rather than time developing the thought processes of induction and deduction and the conceptual mental pictures or images or models which lead to our mental picture of our world from the infinitely small to the infinitely large, from the infinite past to the infinite future.  Concepts of what is space and what is time?  What is an electron for example?  What is a proton or a neutron?  What is an hydrogen atom?  What is cancer?  What is a living cell? Etc., etc., etc.<br />One can memorize the name of a bird in 4 or 8 or 100 languages, but in the end one learns from this effort nothing about how a bird flies or obtains food or reproduces or cleans itself or makes a nest etc.  We spend far too much effort on rote memorization of names, rather than developing the critical mental processes for analysis and synthesis to, hopefully, reach beyond what others have placed before us, and move to a new direction and new knowledge.  Very few ideas are really new and most have been already discovered by others perhaps decades or centuries ago.  Even experienced scholars often do not properly give credit to others.  Young students must be taught to strictly comply with the rules of science and the scientific method, of honestly giving credit to others who have already made discoveries, and honestly reporting all facts of experiments, and honestly reporting all possible problems with experiments or various interpretations of them.  All pro and all con must be presented, not just one sided advertisements.<br />The great physicist Richard Feynman emphasizes this in his various writings.  One must not fool<br />others, but most importantly, one must not fool oneself.  It is easiest to fool oneself.<br />Mathematical thought processes are essential for science, but one almost never proves any scientific principle with the usual inductive or deductive mathematical proof.  The proof that scientists use is the one scoffed at by mathematicians; namely, the proof by example.  The first thing one learns in mathematics is that no finite number of examples can prove a general theorem.  But one counter example can disprove a general theorem.   But in science the only true way or \"proof\" is by example.  One considers certain laws \"proved\", like Newton's Law of Gravitation or Coulomb's electrical force law or Kepler's laws of planetary motion because they have been shown to agree with experiments over and over and over again without exception.  Then we regard them as \"proved\".  Of course in a pure mathematical sense they still remain to be proved.<br />Science is really nothing more than what can be reproduced by others experimentally and nothing more.  One must be very careful reading too much and implying too much and extrapolating too far from concepts and pictures and models, because one can be very misled by false assumptions.  In science on must constantly check one's premises and assumptions.  Assumptions can be very dangerous especially when one forgets they were made in the first place.<br />Students never learn all this from books and rarely from others.  They learn by doing and that is what science fairs and individual research are all about.  We owe a debt to the many dedicated teachers who spend time with students while others may be more highly rewarded for less.<br />Winfield J.

It is going to reach a boiling point here-maybe not as quickly as it would some places, but you can't keep squeezing more and more from the bottom and middle to please those on high and not have a price to pay. How many times do you think the American public can watch the wealthy and powerful be rewarded-no matter what damage they do, or to how many-see their own meager savings wiped out, not find jobs, be battered over and over by price increases and new 'fees' and taxes,and insult to injury...have the rich and powerful saying 'we' caused it all..? How long before we quit asking and start physically 'taking' a fairer share of things. Insist on some real reform by whatever means it takes? When people are backed against a wall like this, see all we worked for disappearing into already bloated pockets, things getting worse and worse, and 'justice and fairness' so perverted that no one is even pretending to stop those who are doing it, we 'do' fight back.

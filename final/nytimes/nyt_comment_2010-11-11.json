While I have no complaints with his tv work, he may be better suited for radio, and if so that's terrific by me. Compare Miller to other radio broadcasters and you'll quickly see that many are just phoning it in.  As for Morgan, I've wonder how he lasted as long as he did. The guy seemed to carry a sense of entitlement into the booth, that old \"you never played the game\" schtick, and had a tendency to put Miller down from time to time from that perspective. I never heard Morgan say anything that could charitably called insightful. I hope Miller takes the radio-only deal. That way I can listen to him on ESPN on Sundays, XM radio when the Giants are at home, and on <a href=\"http://mlb.com\" target=\"_blank\">mlb.com</a> gameday when they're on the road.

If I could network them and operate them from a central core computer I'd do it that way, but restrictive EULAs (End User Licensing Agreements) interfere with an otherwise sensible arrangement.<br /><br />Like all things, Tablet PCs have shortcomings. My main gripe doesn't involve the hardware so much as how Microsoft's Windows Vista Business OS runs on it.  Vista turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. Supposedly, intramural corporate politics at Microsoft created Win-Vista's shortcomings. One department wouldn't cooperate with another so the OS that Microsoft finally released isn't versatile enough. The teams that developed Vista didn't go far enough in integrating the stylus handwriting functions with various applications; why Tablet PCs haven't caught on with the general market.  Leo Laporte (<a href=\"http://techguylabs.com/)  can\" target=\"_blank\">http://techguylabs.com/)  can</a> probably shed some light on the ins-&amp;-outs of how this came about.<br /><br />Supposedly, Nuance Software's Dragon Naturally speaking (speech-to-text) application  (<a href=\"http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm)  surmounts\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm)  surmounts</a> this bottleneck, although I haven't tested it myself. I think with my fingers; dictating, I lose the thread. When I start talking, my brain stops working (funny thing about that) unless I read from a prepared outline supplemented by detailed notes, complicating the process considerably.<br /><br />However, even with the drawbacks and shortcomings I find the Tablet PC platform remarkably versatile.

My aunt lived in such place, and they charged $700 a month if you required even a daily multi-vitamin -- residents were FORBIDDEN to take even a vitamin themselves, or from family. That meant either no meds of any kind OR you had to pay $700 a month. If you took more than 5 meds, or required anything like a diabetic diet, it was more like $1500 extra a month. This is on top of about $4000 for the basic facility fee.<br/><br/>Frankly, it is a racket. From what I saw, there was NOTHING provided in terms of health care or maintenance, entertainment, room &amp; board, that would justify a cost of $5000 or so a month, yet this is on the low end of what AL care costs and nursing homes are double that. These are private, for-profit businesses and run with virtually no state oversight or rules (at least, ones the facility cannot easily get around)."}]}, "lft": 354, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/health/some-older-patients-are-treated-not-wisely-but-too-much.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 16608161, "rgt": 357, "userDisplayName": "Mr. Robin P Little", "createDate": "1447043630", "userID": 29883919, "replyCount": 1, "commentTitle": "<br/>", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1447049489", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Conway, SC", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1447049489", "commentSequence": 16608161, "commentBody": "<br/>Many elderly people at least having Medicare insurance, and many also having Medi-gap policies on top of it.

Unless we change this system of medicine, which is unlikely, we will have over-treatment of the elderly. <br/><br/>I recently stopped being treated by a large, local urology clinic which kept testing me for urology problems on every visit for 4 years even though I only went there for testosterone replacement therapy, and showed no symptoms of urology problems.  (For the critics out there: yes, I need it. My body makes no testosterone on its own. This isn't the classic 'low-T' situation. On a scale of about 900, I get a 20 without supplemental testosterone.) I consider the clinic to a be a Medicare billing mill. There are probably thousands of these in America. Between regular Federal payments and Medi-gap on top, these clinics make plenty of money.

He takes a host of medications, but can barely keep awake.  His type of Parkinson's is such that he has muscle stiffness, as opposed to tremors.  Of course he takes a statin.  Statins increase muscle discomfort.  His mouth is always dry from  his meds.  His teeth and gums have suffered from dry mouth.  He takes other meds for various reasons.  The upshot is that he's rarely totally awake.  So, though none of these meds will slow the progression of the disease, merely mask the symptoms, I think he would be better off attacking the problem with exercise and various supplements.  I've advised COQ10, also advised by some neurologists, but he has resisted that, telling me his physician doesn't think it would help.  I don't think what his physician is doing helps.  Another friend's father had Parkinson's and was also rarely awake.  She and her brother have decided not to take any meds and are prepping themselves for the possibility of the disease by doing lots of exercise, taking supplements,  and trying to maintain a sensible diet.

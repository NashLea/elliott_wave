Successive administrations, both democratic and republican exhibited surprising discipline over the decades necessary to whittle the national debt down to something manageable. And, it WAS manageable until Reagan/Bush and Bush/Quayle. The Clinton administration resumed fiscal discipline but Bush/Cheney threw it all away by deregulating the insurance, banking, investment  industries and spoon-feeding the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about.<br /><br />At the time, it seemed prudent to increase the national debt rather than lose to Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese.  Successive administrations struggled (successfully) to manage that debt, the standard of living increased and America actually experienced unparalleled prosperity while that debt was being whittled away. With the condition of the banking and investment industries at the time, it was the only economic tool that FDR had available to him. So, he used it.<br /><br />It took my and my parent\u2019s entire generation to pay down that national debt but, my parents\u2019 generation had no problem in laying down their very lives to fight the Axis countries and I had no problem with paying the debt that they created. In a way, it was my inherited contribution to winning WWII. Interestingly, during the generations that were paying off FDRs national debt, America experienced unparalleled prosperity.<br /><br />Obama is simply using the same tool that FDR successfully used to get us out of this economic mess. Obama didn\u2019t create this mess. He inherited it. That\u2019s a historical fact. And, if the national debt goes to record highs it only means that Obama\u2019s predecessors screwed up proportionately. It also means that, although Obama\u2019s predecessors created the current fiscal crisis for less than noble reasons, it still remains my children\u2019s responsibility to pay off  what I cannot pay off.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in learning the facts of who created the national debt, they can simply Google \u2018history of the national debt\u2019. You will find that when Obama took office, the national debt was already over $9 trillion. And, like FDR before him,  given the condition of the investment and banking industries as well as the rest of the economy, it is the only economic tool that he has. And, he\u2019s using it.<br /><br />We have an immediate problem. Without going further into debt, this country will not economically survive.  It is important to look at the national debt differently. Look at it as an economic tool. How high will the national debt go? Who knows? Who cares? It\u2019s almost irrelevant. What is certain is that if it\u2019s not used effectively as an economic tool, many of you will NEVER WORK AGAIN.<br /><br />Debt didn\u2019t get us into this mess.

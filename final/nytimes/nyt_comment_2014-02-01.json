Granted what they did was in fact intentional but that is NOT what created this massive gridlock!<br/><br/>The bridge was built long before Fort Lee politicians destroyed the population. There are over 40,000 residents in a town not even 2.5 square miles when you factor in the highways. The population is so bad - every 4 days someone is either hit and or killed by a car, for the past three years. Over 220 people have been hit and over 25 are dead. Who's fault is that Mayor Sokolich?<br/><br/>This was not, I repeat, this was NOT a one time incident. Gridlock occurs every time the bridge backs up.  For the Mayor of Fort Lee (Mark Jokolich as he is known to all the residents) to feign such indignation regarding endangering the lives of Fort Lee residents is just as laughable as Christie claiming he didn't know.<br/><br/>The Mayor is well aware of the life threatening situation in Fort Lee and went ahead and built two 47 story towers that will house an additional 900 rental units. Do the math. How many more residents and lives will be put at risk. Will Mayor Jokolich blame Christie for that as well? Yes what Christie did may've been intentional but what Mayor Jokolich did was far worse because he endangers the lives of the residents every day.

Instead of incentivising consumption, waste and monopolization a proper tax system recognizes conservation and thrift as the top economic virtues they rightly are. To this end labor is exactly the thing to be totally tax free. Labor stored up as capital should also have zero tax as well as the products of labor and capital such as infrastructure and development. Taxes on labor and production undermine natural incentives. Instead all public revenue must come from that which rightly and justly belongs to all, the earth and its riches. A \"footprint tax\" from each according to the tax each places on the balance of nature is what should support the public sector. This is a simple tax on the location of property and the minerals extracted according to the market value of each. Monopolization of mutual resources for tax free private gain is economically unjust and is a driver of unsustainable growth, criminal waste and our addictions to consumerism and greed.

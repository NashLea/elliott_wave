Any score under 1 signifies not simply gender inequality, but specifically anti-female inequality.  So obviously, any score over 1 signifies anti-male inequality, right?  Wrong.  There are no scores over 1.  You see, according to the Global Gender Gap Report, any time a nation favors men, it's called gender inequality, which is bad, and any time a nation favors women it's called \"equality\" which \"from a values and social justice perspective... is long overdue.\"<br /><br />Here's an example from the 2009 report.  Turn to page 184 which is where the figures for the United States are to be found.  Under \"Educational Attainment,\" we see the four subcategories I mentioned previously.  Men and women are equal in the literacy subcategory, but in each of the other three - primary, secondary and tertiary education - there is a higher percentage of girls and women than boys and men.  So clearly, according to the criteria laid down by the Report, girls and women do better than boys and men in education in the United States.  Ergo, the country's score in this category is 1 which signifies \"equality.\"  Inequality equals equality.  See how it works?<br /><br />According to that scoring methodology, if a nation sent only girls to school and denied boys any form of education at all, male and female education would be considered equal.  That nation would receive the coveted score of 1.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 0}, {"assetID": 1102461, "replies": [], "lft": 178, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/female-factor-conversations.html#/5/", "parentID": null, "commentID": 2670426, "rgt": 179, "userDisplayName": "Petra", "createDate": "1286853620", "userID": 43544660, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "Comment", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1286857337", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "AZ", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1286853737", "commentSequence": 77, "commentBody": "I was a single mother for six years in Germany, now I am a mother of three, married, in the US.

We started co-sleeping when our older daughter was about 8 months. it was accidental--I was too tired to get her back into her crib. Co-sleeping meant we could sleep in on weekends and take family naps. It was a sad day when that stopped working with our older daughter!<br /><br />For those who complain that co-sleeping means no intimate time with your spouse a) you can have sex other places b) you can have the baby sleep somewhere else until their first night waking and then bring them to bed, which is what we do.<br /><br />Babies sleep very well cuddled up with their warm source of food. Wouldn't we all? It isn't perfect every night--there are nights I roll over to a very awake \"ba ba ba\" and a desire to play at 5AM. But in general, we all sleep more, and are all happier.

Taking advantage of Barney Frank and Chris Dodd's effort to bring in Mark to Market, and remove the Uptick Rule in 2007, Soros went into high gear.

In addition Soros networked with foreign sovereign wealth funds to start pulling money out of US institutions starting in July 2008 to put more pressure on them in order to drop asset valuation and stock price.  At the same time through organizations he helps fund, and uses to funnel funds through, Soros provided millions of dollars to the Obama campaign a lot of that from overseas.  Obama attacks the Chamber of Commerce about foreign $$$, but it is he who profited from it.<br />Soros put millions out of work.  Many took their own lives afterwards.

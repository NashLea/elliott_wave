This season, at New Directors/New Films, you could have seen Cairo 678, about three women, in Cairo, who stand up against sexual harassment. They fight back: both physically, and legally, and win. It's the most feminist film I've seen in years, and it comes from an Arab country, (not the first place you think of as fomenting feminist cinema) and is directed by a guy! Or, at Sundance, you might have seen Gun Hill Road, about a young transgender woman coming of age, played by an actress who is a young transgender woman: also, at Sundance, you might have seen a film set in Iran about two female lovers, and what they have to do to survive in that society. All of those three films will have releases, by the way: so go see them! Thelma and Louise didn't change society, but it paved the way for screen images that will matter to current and future generations of filmmakers and most importantly, to movie-goers like you and me and all the young women and men coming out of school now. And that is, although not yet enough, still a kind of happy ending.", "recommendationCount": 2}, {"assetID": 2663582, "replies": [], "lft": 262, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/world/guantanamo-files-lives-in-an-american-limbo.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3731588, "rgt": 263, "userDisplayName": "Rik  Zak", "createDate": "1303705530", "userID": 60836378, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303705982", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303702382", "commentSequence": 74, "commentBody": "Hello America.

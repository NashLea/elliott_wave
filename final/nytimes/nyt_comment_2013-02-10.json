Here slack demand raises two problems:  First, can businesses, especially the one's with a high proportion of low wage workers make a sufficient profit to warrant a decision to continue to employ worker at $10.00/hr, and second--and this is connected to the First--if you increase the minimum wage to $10.00/hr., will low wages worker even have enough purchasing power to increase consumption enough to increase demand and will they use enough of their increased wages for consumption that sufficiently increases demand.  Now, I am less concerned about worker spending their increased wages for consumption, because the working poor must consume their wages just to get by.  But moving the minimum wage up to $10.00, even if workers spend all of the increase, simply might not be enough purchasing power to increase demand.<br/><br/>The more certain, and more direct course is for the U.S. to do adequate fiscal stimulus first and have that adequately increase demand for goods, services, and, consequently, labor.

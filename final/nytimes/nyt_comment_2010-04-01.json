Apple does NOT sell gadgets of any sort; apple sells what I call \"lifestyle enablers.\"  That is, Apple's ideas enable a person to live their life in a way that's easier, more efficient and enjoyable.  That fact that people do this using gadgets manufactured by Apple is purely coincidental.  If Apple could accomplish their goals by selling magic elves, they would be selling magic elves.<br /><br />Apple asks a simple question:  What will make a little box useful to a lot of people?  In the case of an iPhone, it's apps for  browsing, music, email, weather, maps, contacts, photos, etc.  Apple moves down the list and builds a device that will do all of that fairly well.  They construct a touch screen equal to the task of making people happy while they use all those useful apps.  They painstakingly construct a simple regimen around that touch screen to make it simple and stress-free to use.  When all of this is assembled, they ask:  Can this box be sold at a price that the public will accept?  If so, it's sold.  If not, the design goes back on the shelf until technology prices drop.<br /><br />What about multitasking, USB ports, printing, etc?  If NONE of those are required to deliver the feature list to the customer, they're not important.  A USB port is essential for syncing, but not for browsing.  What could I possibly use multitasking for anyway, beyond listening to music while browsing, reading email or using the NY Times app?  What good is printing when most of my time is spent in meetings, a car, train or restaurant.  In my office, my PC can print documents.<br /><br />Techies throw these features out, but just what do they mean to most people?  Why should I need 4 USB ports?  I don't even use 4 USB ports on my home computer.  All my peripherals are wireless!  Multitasking?  Great on my office computer, where I can open 6 windows and cycle through everything.  If I tried that while walking down the street, I'd get hit by a bus!<br /><br />The iPad is a reader, pure and simple.  It's a reader that can do a lot of very cool things besides being a reader.  It's a Kindle killer (especially at the price point of the lowest cost iPad).  It's not a laptop or a workstation.  It's made to be a conduit to enjoy life.  With it, I'll be able to conduct most of my personal business - the heavy lifting will always be done by the laptop or workstation.<br /><br />Is the hardware expensive, given its features?  Sure.  But it's the software that makes it worthwhile.  The software does not waste my time.  Every minute saved is an additional minute I can spend AWAY from the computer doing something worthwhile.  Those recovered minutes of my life more than make up for the price.  When I get the iPad, it will Just Work.   And that's all I want.<br /><br />", "recommendationCount": 124}, {"assetID": 1318718, "replies": [], "lft": 220, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/us/01nsa.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 1786722, "rgt": 221, "userDisplayName": "seattlesh", "createDate": "1270087291", "userID": 44499492, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1270094980", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Seattle", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1270091380", "commentSequence": 95, "commentBody": "Post # 6 and #19, Walker was a Republican nominee from George H.

If an officer perceives such behavior, he/she then has reason to ask permission to search the vehicle.  Denying permission is grounds to acquire a warrant to search the vehicle.  Therefor, the fourth amendment may be violated based on the perceptions of one individual.  Now consider that the officer, being an individual, may possess biases and prejudices.<br /><br />Bias influences perception and the decision-making processes.  Bias distorts our reality.  Our perceived reality is not reality; between our \"I,\" the ego, the conscious self, and the world (and universe) lies a vast interface system of organs, cells, chemicals, electrons, and things we've yet to name.  Unconscious forces assemble our \"I\"'s reality for us; we don't have to think about perceiving the world in order for us to perceive the world.  In that interface system buffering our consciousness from world as it is lie constructs that inform our biases.  Everyone is biased.  The writers of the Constitution intended to remove (most) personal bias from a system that, by it's nature, can decide the fate of any individual under it.<br /><br />Granted, the example given above does not fully represent the crux of the issue at hand, that of federal surveillance of suspected terrorists.  In my example, the driver had already broken a law (the officer must have witnessed a violation, however minor, in order to pull the vehicle over), was driving a motor vehicle (which is a privilege owing to the danger involved), and is an actual human being.  In the article, no laws had been broken (by the defendants) and both parties are individual entities (chock-full of their own inevitable biases) who, in turn, are made up of numerous individual human beings and much more).<br /><br />It's just more of the same ten-thousand year story.  Individual realities duking it out, the winner's always right.  The winners write the history books.  The winner of a fight in a lawless place feels validated.  The winner's reality prevails.  The winners make the laws.  This is a detrimental arrangment; with every clash a piece of the universe disappears forever.  Whether it's our naivete or a species of frog, liberties, communities, coastlines, or imagination, is of no import.  What matters is not getting back the reality we destroyed but the cessation of ongoing destruction so that we may begin to grow together.  Our \"I\"'s are shards of a shattered shared reality.  We could act with more purpose were we living united.<br /><br />I have my own biases.  I'll be the first to admit.  And the difference between myself and many other biased individuals is that I aim to explore my biases instead of denying them.  Either way, we're all being led by our fundamental belief systems, so why pretend they don't exist?  I interact with my biases; I change it, it changes me.  It's growing.  Suppression is stagnation.<br /><br />Many modern day entities and individuals gain power by controlling, consuming, and metabolizing forces.  Our own biases are such a force, as are sunlight, intelligence, fossil fuels, and civil movements.  It is in the short-sighted interest of these entities to behave this way, and it is often fear that keeps the biases determining such action unexamined (and, therefor, the ability to perceive the long-term consequences of such patterns remain unconscious).  This applies equally well to one's power over one's biases as it does to our collective power over the world as it is.<br /><br />As an insecure country we feel threatened and cajoled into puffing our chest and ruffling our feathers.  As insecure people, we take out our frustrations on entities outside of ourselves, some of which we never see or hear.  As a secure people, in a unified reality, we would have insubstantial frustrations and would need no boss.<br /><br />Half the battle is within ourselves.  Regarding the issue at hand, the government is clearly in the wrong.  There is no need for me to defend that statement, as it finds voice everywhere.  Rather, I'd like to point out that it only takes one deranged driver to cause an accident, despite the best intentions of the victim and the airbags and seat belt and road signs.  What to do?

Eisenhower<br /><br />\"As a matter of general principle, I believe there can be no doubt that criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government ... too many people desire to suppress criticism simply because they think that it will give some comfort to the enemy to know that there is such criticism. If that comfort makes the enemy feel better for a few moments, they are welcome to it as far as I am concerned, because the maintenance of the right of criticism in the long run will do the country maintaining it a great deal more good than it will do the enemy, and will prevent mistakes which might otherwise occur.\"<br />- Robert Taft<br /><br />Their words are forever interwoven with the warnings given to us by Ben Franklin on the dangers of trading liberty for security. The fact is we live in a free society, a republic, and in such a society there is no such thing as absolute safety. Heck, even in police states such as North Korea, there is no such thing as absolute safety. Faced with the iron will of the constitution and unabashed principles interwoven in the document by the Founders, versus the corrupt power seeking politicians of today, I will choose the founders. Besides everything that you fear could still happen even with wiretaps without warrants. So why not side with liberty? It wasn't a warrant that allowed terrorists to get in our country. It was incompetence and a failure to communicate with in our government between the different agencies. This incompetence is no excuse to legislate against liberty.

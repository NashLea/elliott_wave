What a disgraceful idea.\r<br/><br/>The Republicans are just running out of talking points and excuses, aren't they? Recent polls reveal more than 80 percent of Americans want the richest among us taxed at pre-Bush levels. Most of us want a public option in health care, thus ensuring that everyone will be treated equally and no class, age or race resentments will ever rear their ugly heads. Universal health care is what will free up more cash for jobs, since employers will no longer have to foot the bill for the outrageously priced private insurance that is the real culprit in our skyrocketing health care costs.\r<br/><br/>We've got 20 percent de facto unemployment and a government that seems unified in the notion that more suffering is the only answer. I've got three words on how to end the deficit and increase revenues: jobs, jobs, jobs. Corporations are hoarding their profits instead of creating jobs. In a recession, the government has to spend money in order to make money. It's called investing in our own citizens.

But that fact is exactly why Rep. Ryan's cowardly Path to Poverty is so unserious, while President Obama's proposal would set us on the right path. <br/><br/>First, Rep. Ryan's plan reacts to the short and long term deficits by digging America even deeper into a hole.  The two critical steps for addressing short term deficits are asking the wealthy elite and corporations to begin paying their fair share again, and to continue efforts to stimulate economic growth which, in turn, will increase revenue.  Instead, Ryan proposes to give even further tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, and to cut spending that benefits the middle class, working class, and poor which will even further deflate our economy.  In short, Ryan is proposing to continue the conservative economic policies that dug us into this fiscal mess. <br/><br/>Second, of the two proposals, only one - President Obama's - includes any plan to address the long term deficit issue.  The long term deficit is not a problem of government per se, but rather is the problem that health care costs across the board are escalating rapidly.  Ryan does nothing to curb these costs, but instead seeks to shift them to seniors by abolishing Medicare and eviscerating Medicaid.  Given that Medicare and Medicaid are more effective at curbing health care cost increases than is private insurance, such an approach would lead to our country spending even more on health care even if government is technically paying less.  By contrast, President Obama and the Democrats have already enacted a number of policies as part of health care reform that will reduce health care costs and are proposing to do even more by using the government's position as a major purchaser of health care to make the health care industry far more cost effective.  In response, Republicans have scapegoated such efforts with lies about \"death panels,\" and are now proposing to repeal health care reform.  That Republican approach would, of course, increase long term health care costs, not reduce them. <br/><br/>While not often thought about as a fiscal issue, a third area where Republicans are showing themselves to be truly unserious on the deficit is immigration.  Putting more immigrants on a path to citizenship would be a great way to help alleviate long term fiscal concerns, as it would provide more younger workers to be paying into Medicare and Social Security.  Yet Republicans continue to push to reduce immigration, which has always been the lifeblood of our country, through closed door policies in states like Arizona.  <br/><br/>The facts show that conservatives for decades pushed policies designed to increase deficits and now are using those deficits to try to cut government programs that they do not approve of.  The facts also show that today conservatives continue to be unserious about actually reducing the deficit.  If you are actually interested in having government live within its means while maintaining our way of life, rather than in simply continuing to shovel tax cuts and subsidies to the wealthy elite, you should be supporting Democrats, not unserious cowards like Rep. Ryan. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" title=\"http://www.winningprogressive.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.winningprogressive.org</a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" title=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Winning-Progressive/195682780442236</a>", "recommendationCount": 350}, {"assetID": 2642318, "replies": [], "lft": 10, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18douthat.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 3702503, "rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Old farmer", "createDate": "1303092651", "userID": 183589, "replyCount": 0, "commentTitle": "hardcoded comment title", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1303103832", "userTitle": null, "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": null, "userLocation": "Ogden, Utah", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1303100232", "commentSequence": 4, "commentBody": "It's good you're thinking 20, 30, 40 years into the future because you haven't a clue as to what to do to get us out of the current anemic recovery.

We all know we will need Medicare, not vouchers of ever diminishing value to pay for our medical costs as we age.\r<br/><br/>Third, no matter how hard you try, abolishing Medicare, which is really what Ryan proposes, is DOA with most Americans.

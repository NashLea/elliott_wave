Harvard can admit anyone it wants, it's endowment is bigger than some countries' GDP.  It has intentionally chosen to include more and more students from other-than-rich backgrounds.  Need-based financial aid is enormously generous so Harvard is simply NOT expensive -- the only students  who have to pay much are those who really can afford it, while everyone else gets subsidized.  Hardly anyone who gets admitted is unable to attend because the family can't afford it, and I do believe their statements that admission does not look at the family's financial means.  It's true being a white, middle-class American with a stable home life provides advantages in life -- it certainly qualifies as \"privileged\" in the global sense.  But this has nothing to do with the kind of elitist stereotype people are talking about here.  You can get into an Ivy League school with intelligence, hard work, some personal accomplishment that you bring to the table and is perceived as contributing to the college community, and, sure, some luck.  But it doesn't take an affluent family.  And it doesn't take \"tutors and consultants,\" just parents and maybe one or two teachers. <br/><br/>Parents: raise good kids, love them unconditionally, encourage them, be proud of them, let them know you really value their hard work, and work as hard as you can to connect them with opportunities to accomplish things -- and then see what kind of results you get.

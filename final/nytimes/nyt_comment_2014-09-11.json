My conclusion is many downtrodden, disenfranchised and unaccepted Sunni Arabs from Saudi Arabia to Britain believe ISIS is a meritocracy where they can \"be all they can be\". Many young Arabs aren't going to feel this \"FREEDOM\" in Saudi Arabia, to be sure. <br/><br/>ISIS lines up Sunni Arabs from all over the world in these videos to show off the \"melting pot\" that is ISIS. In that sense, ISIS is borrowing from \"the American dream\". I saw the VICE documentary too. I couldn't get over how all the Sunni Arab members of ISIS proclaimed the \"freedom\" they feel ridding themselves of their restrictive pasts. They're like born again Muslims. The identity they feel belonging to ISIS comes across as palpable and intoxicating. <br/><br/>It's uncanny. That being said, I think like all things, reality will set in. ISIS will have to govern because you can't \"play pirate\" when you control so much land. I think ISIS, the extreme group we now know, will slowly lose its charm and ultimately evolve into a moderate but still very important mover in the region.  <br/><br/>I don't think Obama's approach is particularly appealing. It's stale, expensive, could make things worse and could provoke attacks on our homeland.

The difference is that this is Republican spending, not Democratic spending. <br/><br/>Jude Wanniski, economic strategist for Ronald Reagan pioneered the \"Two Santa Clauses\" theory for Reagan. The inestimable Thom Hartmann describes it admirably:<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/01/26-0\" title=\"https://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/01/26-0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/01/26-0</a><br/><br/>\"Democrats, [Wanniski] said, had been able to be \"Santa Clauses\" by giving people things from the largesse of the federal government. Republicans could do that, too \u2013 spending could actually increase. Plus, Republicans could be double Santa Clauses by cutting people's taxes! For working people it would only be a small token \u2013 a few hundred dollars a year on average \u2013 but would be heavily marketed. And for the rich it would amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts. The rich, in turn, would use that money to import or build more stuff to market, thus increasing supply and stimulating the economy. And that growth in the economy would mean that the people still paying taxes would pay more because they were earning more.<br/><br/>There was no way, Wanniski said, that the Democrats could ever win again.\" "}]}, "lft": 138, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/opinion/krugman-the-story-of-our-time.html", "parentID": null, "commentID": 8871889, "rgt": 147, "userDisplayName": "gdnp", "createDate": "1367207957", "userID": 54384918, "replyCount": 4, "commentTitle": "n/a", "status": "approved", "approveDate": "1367208069", "userTitle": "NULL", "editorsSelection": 0, "statusID": 2, "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New Jersey", "commentType": "comment", "updateDate": "1367204469", "commentSequence": 15, "commentBody": "Do something about the depression we're in?

Mortgage underwriting seemed to draw younger people who were shut out of their fields and I've known a variety of people including laid off journos and filmmakers who wound up flipping houses. For people inskilled blue collar trades, occupations, sheetrock and roofing have always been the fates that they've tried to avoid. In places like Atlanta, many traditional large employers shrank their staffs and large blue collar employers like the auto companies left town. Those circumstances may explain why 20% of the employment sector their was tied to real estate and why despite only a modest bubble, the real estate sector is one of the most hard hit with people losing 20 years of appreciation in some parts of the metro area. Ultimately, property development reached a point where it could not absorb losses elsewhere in the economy.

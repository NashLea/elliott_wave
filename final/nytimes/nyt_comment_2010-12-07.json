The whole league should be singing it as well- the only question left is, who gets to lose the Super Bowl to the Patriots? They are looking like an all-time team just hitting it's stride. It also helps to have Brady- far and away the best player in NFL history. Your only hope is to get a pass rush on him like the Giants did in the Super Bowl a few years ago- but this is difficult as he gets rid of the ball so quickly and has one of the all time best pass blocking offensive lines (been that for years). They don't committ penalties either- and totally out-hit the Jets from the get go. The Pats only worry is Sourpuss Bill's penchant for running up the score- you keep wondering if he's going to pay by getting Brady injured by keeping him in the game in one of their patented 40 point blowouts.
